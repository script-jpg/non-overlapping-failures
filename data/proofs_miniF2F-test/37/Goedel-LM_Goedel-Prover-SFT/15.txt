  To solve the expression \(\sqrt{1,000,000} - \sqrt[3]{1,000,000}\) and show that it equals 900, we proceed as follows:
  1. Recognize that \(\sqrt{1,000,000}\) is an integer, specifically 1000.
  2. Simplify the expression \(\sqrt{1,000,000} - \sqrt[3]{1,000,000}\) by substituting the known values.
  3. Calculate the cube root of 1,000,000, which is 100.
  4. Subtract 100 from 1000 to get the final result of 900.
