  To solve the problem of finding the value of \(\sqrt{1,000,000} - \sqrt[3]{1,000,000}\), we need to evaluate each term separately and then subtract the results.
  1. **Evaluate \(\sqrt{1,000,000}\):**
     - \(1,000,000\) can be written as \(10^6\).
     - Using the property of the square root, \(\sqrt{10^6} = 10^3 = 1000\).
  2. **Evaluate \(\sqrt[3]{1,000,000}\):**
     - \(1,000,000\) can be written as \(10^6\).
     - Using the property of the cube root, \(\sqrt[3]{10^6} = 10^{6/3} = 10^2 = 100\).
  3. **Subtract the results:**
     - \(\sqrt{1,000,000} - \sqrt[3]{1,000,000} = 1000 - 100 = 900\).
  Thus, the value of \(\sqrt{1,000,000} - \sqrt[3]{1,000,000}\) is \(900\).
