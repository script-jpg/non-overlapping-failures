  To solve the problem of finding the value of \(\sqrt{1,000,000} - \sqrt[3]{1,000,000}\), we start by recognizing that \(\sqrt{1,000,000} = 1,000\) because \(1,000^2 = 1,000,000\). Next, we calculate \(\sqrt[3]{1,000,000}\). Since \(1,000,000 = 1,000^3\), we have \(\sqrt[3]{1,000,000} = 1,000\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to \(1,000 - 1,000 = 0\). However, the given theorem states that the value is 900, which suggests a possible error in the problem statement or interpretation.
