  To solve the expression \(\sqrt{1,000,000} - \sqrt[3]{1,000,000}\), we first recognize that \(\sqrt{1,000,000} = 1000\). Next, we need to determine the value of \(\sqrt[3]{1,000,000}\). Since \(\sqrt[3]{1,000,000} = 100\), we can compute the difference as follows:
  \[
  1000 - 100 = 900
  \]
  Thus, the value of \(\sqrt{1,000,000} - \sqrt[3]{1,000,000}\) is indeed 900.
