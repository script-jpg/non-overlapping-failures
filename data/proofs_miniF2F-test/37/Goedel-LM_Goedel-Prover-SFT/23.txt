  To prove that \(\sqrt{1,000,000} - \sqrt[3]{1,000,000} = 900\), we start by simplifying the expressions under the square root and cube root. 
  1. \(\sqrt{1,000,000}\) can be rewritten as \(\sqrt{10^6}\), which simplifies to \(10^3 = 1000\).
  2. \(\sqrt[3]{1,000,000}\) is already in the form of a cube root of a power of 10, which can be simplified to \(10^2 = 100\).
  Now, we compute the difference:
  \[
  1000 - 100 = 900
  \]
  Thus, the value of \(\sqrt{1,000,000} - \sqrt[3]{1,000,000}\) is indeed 900.
