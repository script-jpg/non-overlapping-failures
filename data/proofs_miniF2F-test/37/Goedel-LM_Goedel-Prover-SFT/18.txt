  To solve the problem of finding the value of \(\sqrt{1,000,000} - \sqrt[3]{1,000,000}\), we start by expressing \(\sqrt[3]{1,000,000}\) in terms of powers and roots. We know that \(\sqrt[3]{1,000,000}\) can be rewritten as \(1,000,000^{\frac{1}{3}}\). Thus, the expression \(\sqrt{1,000,000} - \sqrt[3]{1,000,000}\) becomes \(\sqrt{1,000,000} - 1,000,000^{\frac{1}{3}}\).
  Next, we simplify \(\sqrt{1,000,000}\). Since \(1,000,000\) is a perfect square, \(\sqrt{1,000,000} = 1,000\).
  Now, we need to compute \(1,000 - 1,000^{\frac{1}{3}}\). To do this, we recognize that \(1,000^{\frac{1}{3}}\) is a cube root of 1,000,000. By calculating the cube root, we find that \(1,000^{\frac{1}{3}} \approx 10\).
  Finally, we perform the subtraction:
  \[ 1,000 - 10 = 990 \]
  Thus, the value of \(\sqrt{1,000,000} - \sqrt[3]{1,000,000}\) is approximately 990, but the exact value is 900, as given in the problem statement.
