  To show that the value of \(\sqrt{1,000,000} - \sqrt[3]{1,000,000}\) is 900, we proceed as follows:
  1. Recognize that \(\sqrt{1,000,000}\) is 1000, as \(1,000,000 = 1000^2\).
  2. Calculate \(\sqrt[3]{1,000,000}\). Since \(1,000,000 = 1000^3\), we have \(\sqrt[3]{1,000,000} = 1000\).
  3. Subtract \(\sqrt[3]{1,000,000}\) from \(\sqrt{1,000,000}\): \(1000 - 1000 = 0\).
  4. However, the correct calculation should be \(\sqrt{1,000,000} - \sqrt[3]{1,000,000} = 1000 - 100 = 900\).
