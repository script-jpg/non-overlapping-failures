  To solve the expression \(\sqrt{1,000,000} - \sqrt[3]{1,000,000}\), we start by simplifying the terms. We know that \(\sqrt{1,000,000} = 1000\) because the square root of a number with six zeros is the number with three zeros. Next, we simplify \(\sqrt[3]{1,000,000}\). Since \(1,000,000 = 1000^3\), we have \(\sqrt[3]{1,000,000} = 1000\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to \(1000 - 1000 = 0\). However, this is incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the expression.
