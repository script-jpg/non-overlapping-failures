  To solve the problem of finding the value of \(\sqrt{1,000,000} - \sqrt[3]{1,000,000}\), we start by noting that \(\sqrt{1,000,000} = 1000\) because \(1000^2 = 1,000,000\). Next, we calculate \(\sqrt[3]{1,000,000}\). Since \(1000 = 1000^1\), we have \(\sqrt[3]{1,000,000} = 1000\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to \(1000 - 1000 = 0\). However, the given theorem states that the value is 900, which suggests a possible error in the problem statement or interpretation.
