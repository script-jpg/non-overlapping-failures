  To solve the expression \(\sqrt{1,000,000} - \sqrt[3]{1,000,000}\), we start by recognizing that \(\sqrt{1,000,000} = 1,000\) because \(1,000^2 = 1,000,000\). Next, we simplify \(\sqrt[3]{1,000,000}\). Since \(1,000,000 = 1,000^3\), we have \(\sqrt[3]{1,000,000} = 1,000\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to \(1,000 - 1,000 = 0\). However, this is incorrect. Let's correct the simplification.
