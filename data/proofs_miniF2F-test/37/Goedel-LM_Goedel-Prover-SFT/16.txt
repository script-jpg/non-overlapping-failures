  To solve the problem of finding the value of \(\sqrt{1,000,000} - \sqrt[3]{1,000,000}\), we start by recognizing that \(1,000,000\) can be expressed as \(10^6\). Using properties of exponents and square roots, we can simplify the expression. Specifically, we know that \(\sqrt{10^6} = 10^3\) because the square root of a number is the cube root of the number when raised to the power of 6. Similarly, \(\sqrt[3]{10^6} = 10^2\) because the cube root of a number is the fifth root of the number when raised to the power of 6. Substituting these simplified forms back into the original expression, we get \(10^3 - 10^2\). Simplifying this, we find that \(10^3 - 10^2 = 900\).
