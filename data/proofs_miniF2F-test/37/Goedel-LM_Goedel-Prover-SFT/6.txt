  To solve the expression \(\sqrt{1{,}000{,}000} - \sqrt[3]{1{,}000{,}000}\), we start by recognizing that \(\sqrt{1{,}000{,}000}\) is simply \(1{,}000{,}000\) because the square root of a number squared is the number itself. Next, we simplify \(\sqrt[3]{1{,}000{,}000}\). Since \(1{,}000{,}000\) is a perfect cube, \(\sqrt[3]{1{,}000{,}000} = 100\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to \(1{,}000{,}000 - 100 = 999{,}900\). However, this result does not match the expected value of 900. Let's re-evaluate the steps to ensure correctness.
