  To solve the problem of finding the value of \(\sqrt{1,000,000} - \sqrt[3]{1,000,000}\), we start by recognizing that \(1,000,000\) can be expressed as \(10^6\). We then use the properties of roots and exponents to simplify the expression.
  1. \(\sqrt{1,000,000} = \sqrt{10^6} = 10^3 = 1000\).
  2. \(\sqrt[3]{1,000,000} = \sqrt[3]{10^6} = 10^2 = 100\).
  Thus, the expression simplifies to:
  \[
  \sqrt{1,000,000} - \sqrt[3]{1,000,000} = 1000 - 100 = 900.
