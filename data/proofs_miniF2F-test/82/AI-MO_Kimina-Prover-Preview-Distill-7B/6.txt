-- We begin by considering the congruence `3n ≡ 2 (mod 11)`, which means that `3n = 2 + 11k` for some integer `k`.
  -- Our goal is to show that `n ≡ 8 (mod 11)`, which means `n = 8 + 11m` for some integer `m`.
  -- To solve the congruence, we need the multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 11.
  -- By inspection, we notice that `3 * 4 = 12 = 1 + 11`, so 4 is the multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 11.
  have h₁ : n % 11 = 8 := by
    -- We multiply both sides of the original congruence by 4:
    -- `4 * (3n) ≡ 4 * 2 (mod 11)`
    -- This simplifies to: `12n ≡ 8 (mod 11)`
    -- Since `12 ≡ 1 (mod 11)`, we get: `n ≡ 8 (mod 11)`
    omega

  -- The `omega` tactic is powerful for solving these kinds of arithmetic goals.
  -- It can deduce that if `3n % 11 = 2`, then `n % 11` must be 8, given that `n` is a natural number.
  -- The tactic essentially performs the arithmetic reasoning we outlined above.

The key insight is that by multiplying both sides of the congruence $3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}$ by the multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 11, which is 4, we get $12n \equiv 8 \pmod{11}$. Since $12 \equiv 1 \pmod{11}$, this simplifies to $n \equiv 8 \pmod{11}$. Therefore, $n = 8$ is a solution, and it lies in the range from 0 to 10 as required.
