-- Check that 3 * n % 11 = 2 implies that n % 11 = 8.
  -- Since 3 * n % 11 = 2, we have 3 * n = 11 * k + 2 for some integer k.
  -- Then n = (11 * k + 2) / 3. For n to be an integer, 11 * k + 2 must be divisible by 3.
  -- Trying various values of k, we find that the smallest non-negative solution is n = 8.
  -- Thus, n % 11 = 8.
