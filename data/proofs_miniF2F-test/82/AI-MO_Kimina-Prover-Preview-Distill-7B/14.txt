-- The problem is to solve the congruence $3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}$ for n, and express the answer as a residue between 0 and 10.
  -- We first rewrite the congruence as an equation.
  have h₁ : ∃ (k : ℤ), (3 * n - 2) / 11 = k := by
    refine ⟨(3 * n - 2) / 11, by omega⟩
  have h₂ : (3 * n - 2) % 11 = 0 := by
    omega
  -- Now re-arrange terms to isolate n.
  have h₃ : (3 * n) % 11 = 2 := by
    exact Nat.sub_mod_eq_zero_of_mod_eq h₂
  have h₄ : (3 * (n % 11)) % 11 = 2 := by
    rw [Nat.mul_mod] at h₃
    exact h₃
  -- Now we reduce the problem to finding n modulo 11.
  have h₅ : ∃ (k : ℤ), (n - 8) / 11 = k := by
    refine ⟨(n - 8) / 11, by omega⟩
  -- We isolate n and turn it into an equation.
  have h₆ : (n - 8) % 11 = 0 := by
    apply Nat.sub_mod_eq_zero_of_mod_eq
    rw [Nat.mul_mod] at h₄
    omega
  -- Hence we can conclude that n ≡ 8 (mod 11) by adding 8 to both sides.
