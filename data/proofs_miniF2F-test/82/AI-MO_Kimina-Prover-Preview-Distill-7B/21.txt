In this proof, we need to solve the linear congruence $3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}$ for $n$ in the range from 0 to 10. To solve such congruences, we can find the multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 11, which is 4 since $3 \times 4 \equiv 1 \pmod{11}$. Then multiplying both sides of the congruence by 4 gives $n \equiv 2 \times 4 \equiv 8 \pmod{11}$. 

The Lean proof uses the `omega` tactic, which is powerful for solving goals involving integer arithmetic. It can handle linear integer constraints and automatically derive that $n \equiv 8 \pmod{11}$ from the hypothesis $3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}$.

So our complete proof is:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

Now we define the theorem:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_247 (n : ℕ) (h₀ : 3 * n % 11 = 2) : n % 11 = 8 := by
  omega
```

The `omega` tactic is sufficient here because it can solve goals involving linear arithmetic over integers. It will automatically find that the only value of $n$ in the range 0 to 10 satisfying $3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}$ is $n = 8$. 

To verify manually: $3 \times 8 = 24$, and $24 \mod 11 = 2$, which matches the given congruence. Therefore, the solution is $n = 8$.
