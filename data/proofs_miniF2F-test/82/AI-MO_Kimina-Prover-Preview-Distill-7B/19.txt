-- The assumption means that $3n = 2 + 11k$ for some integer $k$. We can write this as $3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}$.

  -- To solve the equation $3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}$, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 11.
  -- This is a number $x$ such that $3x \equiv 1 \pmod{11}$.
  -- By inspection, we find that $3 \cdot 4 = 12 \equiv 1 \pmod{11}$, so the inverse is 4.

  -- Now we can multiply both sides of $3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}$ by 4 to get $n \equiv 8 \pmod{11}$.

    omega

  -- This means that $n = 8 + 11m$ for some integer $m$.
