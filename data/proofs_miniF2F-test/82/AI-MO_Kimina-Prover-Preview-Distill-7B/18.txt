-- We are working modulo 11, so we need to find n such that 3n ≡ 2 (mod 11).
  -- To isolate n, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 11.
  -- The inverse of 3 modulo 11 is 4 because 3 * 4 = 12 ≡ 1 (mod 11).
  have h1 : n % 11 = 8 := by
    -- We multiply both sides of the congruence 3n ≡ 2 (mod 11) by 4.
    have h2 : 4 * (3 * n % 11) = 4 * 2 := by
      rw [h₀]
    -- This gives us 12n ≡ 8 (mod 11), which simplifies to n ≡ 8 (mod 11) because 12 ≡ 1 (mod 11).
