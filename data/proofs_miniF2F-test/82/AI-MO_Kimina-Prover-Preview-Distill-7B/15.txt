-- The problem is to Solve the congruence $3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}$, as a residue modulo 11.  (Give an answer between 0 and 10.) Show that it is 8.

  change 3 * n ≡ 2 [MOD 11] at h₀
  change n ≡ 8 [MOD 11]

  have : 3 * n * 4 ≡ 2 * 4 [MOD 11] := by
    exact Nat.ModEq.mul h₀ rfl

  have : 3 * n * 4 ≡ 8 [MOD 11] := by
    change 2 * 4 ≡ 8 [MOD 11]
    exact Nat.ModEq.trans this rfl

  have : n * 4 ≡ 8 [MOD 11] := by
    simp_all

  have : n * 4 * 3 ≡ 8 * 3 [MOD 11] := by
    exact Nat.ModEq.mul this rfl

  have : n * 4 * 3 ≡ 24 [MOD 11] := by
    simp_all

  have : n ≡ 24 [MOD 11] := by
    simp_all
