-- We want to solve the congruence $3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}$ for $n$.
  -- This means finding an integer $n$ such that $3n - 2$ is divisible by 11.
  -- In other words, $3n = 2 + 11k$ for some integer $k$.
  -- Let's find the multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 11.
  -- We need a number $x$ such that $3x \equiv 1 \pmod{11}$.
  -- Testing values, we find that $x = 4$ works since $3 \cdot 4 = 12 \equiv 1 \pmod{11}$.
