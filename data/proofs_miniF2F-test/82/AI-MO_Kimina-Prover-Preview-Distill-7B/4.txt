-- The problem asks us to solve the congruence $3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}$ for $n$ as a residue modulo 11, with $0 \leq n < 11$.

  -- To solve this, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 11.
  -- The inverse is a number $x$ such that $3x \equiv 1 \pmod{11}$.
  -- By inspection or using the extended Euclidean algorithm, we find that $3 \cdot 4 \equiv 12 \equiv 1 \pmod{11}$, so the inverse is 4.

  -- Now we can multiply both sides of the original congruence $3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}$ by 4:
  -- $4 \cdot 3n \equiv 4 \cdot 2 \pmod{11}$
  -- $12n \equiv 8 \pmod{11}$
  -- Since $12 \equiv 1 \pmod{11}$, this simplifies to $n \equiv 8 \pmod{11}$.

  -- Thus, the solution is $n = 8$.
