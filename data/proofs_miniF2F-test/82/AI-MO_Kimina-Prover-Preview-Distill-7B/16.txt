-- The problem is to solve the congruence $3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}$ for $n$, as a residue modulo 11, where $0 \leq n < 11$.

  -- To solve this, first manually check small values of $n$ to see which satisfies the congruence.

  -- When $n = 8$, $3 \times n = 24$ and $24 \equiv 2 \pmod{11}$ since $24 = 2 + 2 \times 11$.

  -- Thus, $n = 8$ satisfies the congruence.

  have : n % 11 = 8 := by

    -- To complete the proof, we should check whether $n \equiv 8 \pmod{11}$ is the only solution.

    -- To that end, let $n = 8 + 11k$ where $k \in \mathbb{Z}$.

    -- Then $3n = 3(8 + 11k) = 24 + 33k$ and $24 + 33k \equiv 2 \pmod{11}$.

    -- Reducing, $24 \equiv 2 \pmod{11}$ and $33k \equiv 0 \pmod{11}$ since $33$ is a multiple of $11$.

    -- So the solution is unique.
