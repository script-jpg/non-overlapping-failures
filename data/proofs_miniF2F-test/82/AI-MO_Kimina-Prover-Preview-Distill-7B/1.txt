-- The possible values of n are given by 8 + 11k for integers k.
  -- We can check this: 3 * (8 + 11k) = 24 + 33k, and 24 + 33k ≡ 2 (mod 11) for any integer k.

  -- To see this another way, note that 3 * 8 = 24 ≡ 2 (mod 11), and 3 * 11 = 33 ≡ 0 (mod 11).
  -- Therefore 3 * (8 + 11k) ≡ 2 + 0 * k (mod 11), which is exactly our congruence.

  -- To solve this congruence, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 3 (mod 11).
  -- Use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find integers x and y such that 3x + 11y = 1.
  have : 3 * 4 % 11 = 1 := by norm_num

  -- Now multiply both sides of the original congruence by 4 (the multiplicative inverse of 3).
  have : 4 * (3 * n % 11) % 11 = 4 * 2 % 11 := by
