-- The problem is to solve the congruence $3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}$, as a residue modulo 11.  (Give an answer between 0 and 10.) Show that it is 8.

  -- To solve the congruence $3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}$, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 11.
  -- The inverse is 4 because $3 \cdot 4 \equiv 1 \pmod{11}$.
  -- Multiplying both sides of the congruence by 4 gives $n \equiv 8 \pmod{11}$.
