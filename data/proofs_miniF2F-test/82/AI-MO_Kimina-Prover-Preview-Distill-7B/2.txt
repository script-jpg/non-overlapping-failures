-- The problem is to solve the congruence $3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}$, as a residue modulo 11.  (Give an answer between 0 and 10.) Show that it is 8.

  change 3 * n ≡ 2 [MOD 11]

  -- Change the form to `n * 3 ≡ 2 [MOD 11]`
  rw [mul_comm]

  -- Next, we need to find multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 11.
  -- By inspection, we can see that 3 * 4 = 12 = 11 + 1, so the inverse of 3 modulo 11 is 4.
  rw [← ZMod.mul_inv_eq_mul_one]
  norm_cast

  -- Then we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4.
  -- We get n * (3 * 4) ≡ n * 1 = n [MOD 11]
  -- So we get n ≡ 2 * 4 = 8 [MOD 11]
