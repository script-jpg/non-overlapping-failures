-- We need to show that if 3 * n % 11 = 2, then n % 11 = 8.
-- We start by rewriting the given congruence in terms of the division algorithm.
-- This gives us 3 * (n % 11) % 11 = 2.
-- We then use the fact that 3 * 8 % 11 = 2 to conclude that n % 11 = 8.
-- This is because the congruence 3 * n % 11 = 2 is satisfied only when n % 11 = 8.
-- This is verified by checking that 3 * 8 % 11 = 2 and no other residue in 0..10 satisfies the congruence.
-- Therefore, n % 11 = 8 is the correct solution.
