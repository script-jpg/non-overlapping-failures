  To solve the congruence \(3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\), we need to find the value of \(n\) modulo 11 such that \(3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\). We start by expressing \(n\) in terms of its residue modulo 11. Let \(n = 11k + r\) for some integer \(k\) and \(r\) being the residue of \(n\) modulo 11. The congruence \(3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\) becomes \(3(11k + r) \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\). Simplifying this, we get \(33k + 3r \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\). Since \(33k \equiv 0 \pmod{11}\), we are left with \(3r \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\). Solving for \(r\), we find that \(r \equiv 8 \pmod{11}\). Therefore, the residue of \(n\) modulo 11 is 8.
