  To solve the congruence \(3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\), we need to find an integer \(n\) such that when \(3n\) is divided by 11, the remainder is 2. We are given that the solution is \(n \equiv 8 \pmod{11}\). We will verify this by substituting \(n = 8\) into the congruence and checking if it holds.

  -- We start by noting the given congruence condition.
  have h₁ : 3 * n % 11 = 2 := h₀
  -- We use the `omega` tactic to solve the congruence. The `omega` tactic is a decision procedure for integer linear arithmetic, which can solve this type of problem.
  have h₂ : n % 11 = 8 := by omega
  -- Finally, we conclude that n modulo 11 is 8.
