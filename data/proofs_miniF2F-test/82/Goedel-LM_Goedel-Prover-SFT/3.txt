  To solve the congruence \(3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\), we need to find the integer \(n\) such that \(3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\). We can use the properties of modular arithmetic to find the solution. Specifically, we can use the fact that if \(3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\), then \(n \equiv 8 \pmod{11}\). This can be verified by checking that \(3 \times 8 \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\).
