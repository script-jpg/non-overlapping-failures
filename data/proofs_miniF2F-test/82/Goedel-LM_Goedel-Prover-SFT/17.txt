  To solve the congruence \(3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\), we need to find an integer \(n\) such that \(3n - 2\) is divisible by 11. We start by expressing \(n\) in terms of its remainder when divided by 11. Let \(n = 11k + r\) for some integer \(k\) and remainder \(r\). Substituting \(n\) into the congruence, we get:
  \[ 3(11k + r) \equiv 2 \pmod{11} \]
  \[ 33k + 3r \equiv 2 \pmod{11} \]
  Since \(33k \equiv 0 \pmod{11}\), this simplifies to:
  \[ 3r \equiv 2 \pmod{11} \]
  We need \(3r \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\). To find \(r\), we solve the equation \(3r \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\). Multiplying both sides by the modular inverse of 3 modulo 11, which is 4 (since \(3 \cdot 4 \equiv 1 \pmod{11}\)), we get:
  \[ r \equiv 2 \cdot 4 \pmod{11} \]
  \[ r \equiv 8 \pmod{11} \]
  Thus, the remainder \(r\) when \(n\) is divided by 11 is 8. Therefore, \(n \equiv 8 \pmod{11}\).
