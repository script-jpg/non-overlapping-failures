  To solve the congruence \(3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\), we need to find the value of \(n\) modulo 11 that satisfies this congruence. We start by expressing \(n\) in terms of its residue modulo 11. Let \(n = 11k + r\) where \(r\) is the residue of \(n\) modulo 11. Substituting \(n\) into the congruence, we get:
  \[ 3(11k + r) \equiv 2 \pmod{11} \]
  Simplifying this, we have:
  \[ 3 \cdot 11k + 3r \equiv 2 \pmod{11} \]
  Since \(3 \cdot 11k \equiv 0 \pmod{11}\), this simplifies to:
  \[ 3r \equiv 2 \pmod{11} \]
  We need to find \(r\) such that \(3r \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\). By testing values from 0 to 10, we find that \(r = 8\) satisfies this congruence:
  \[ 3 \cdot 8 = 24 \equiv 2 \pmod{11} \]
  Thus, the residue \(r\) is 8, and \(n \equiv 8 \pmod{11}\).
