  To solve the congruence \(3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\), we need to find the value of \(n\) modulo 11 such that \(3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\). We start by expressing \(n\) in terms of its residue modulo 11. Let \(n = 11k + r\) for some integer \(k\) and \(0 \leq r < 11\). Substituting \(n\) into the congruence, we get:
  \[ 3(11k + r) \equiv 2 \pmod{11} \]
  \[ 33k + 3r \equiv 2 \pmod{11} \]
  Since \(33k \equiv 0 \pmod{11}\), we have:
  \[ 3r \equiv 2 \pmod{11} \]
  To solve for \(r\), we find the multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 11. The inverse of 3 modulo 11 is 4 because \(3 \cdot 4 = 12 \equiv 1 \pmod{11}\). Multiplying both sides of the congruence by 4, we get:
  \[ r \equiv 2 \cdot 4 \pmod{11} \]
  \[ r \equiv 8 \pmod{11} \]
  Thus, \(n \equiv 8 \pmod{11}\).
