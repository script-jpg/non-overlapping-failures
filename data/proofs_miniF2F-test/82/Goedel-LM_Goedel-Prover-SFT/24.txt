  To solve the congruence \(3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\), we need to find an integer \(n\) such that \(3n\) leaves a remainder of 2 when divided by 11. We aim to show that \(n \equiv 8 \pmod{11}\).
  1. Start by expressing \(n\) in the form \(n = 11k + r\) where \(r\) is the remainder when \(n\) is divided by 11.
  2. Substitute \(n = 11k + r\) into the congruence \(3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\):
     \[
     3(11k + r) \equiv 2 \pmod{11}
     \]
  3. Simplify the left-hand side:
     \[
     33k + 3r \equiv 2 \pmod{11}
     \]
  4. Since \(33k \equiv 0 \pmod{11}\) (because 33 is a multiple of 11), we have:
     \[
     3r \equiv 2 \pmod{11}
     \]
  5. Solve for \(r\) by finding the multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 11. The inverse of 3 modulo 11 is 4 because:
     \[
     3 \cdot 4 \equiv 1 \pmod{11}
     \]
  6. Multiply both sides of the congruence \(3r \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\) by 4:
     \[
     r \equiv 2 \cdot 4 \pmod{11}
     \]
  7. Simplify the right-hand side:
     \[
     r \equiv 8 \pmod{11}
     \]
  8. Therefore, the remainder \(r\) when \(n\) is divided by 11 is 8.
