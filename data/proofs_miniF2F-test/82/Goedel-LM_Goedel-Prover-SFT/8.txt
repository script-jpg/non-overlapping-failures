  To solve the congruence \(3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\), we need to find an integer \(n\) such that \(3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\). We can use the properties of modular arithmetic and the fact that \(3\) and \(11\) are coprime to find the solution. By testing values, we find that \(n = 8\) satisfies the congruence because \(3 \times 8 = 24\) and \(24 \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\).

  -- We know that 3 and 11 are coprime, so we can use the properties of modular arithmetic to find the solution.
  have h₁ : 3 * n % 11 = 2 := h₀
  -- We use the fact that 3 and 11 are coprime to test values.
  have h₂ : n % 11 = 8 := by
    -- We test values to find that n = 8 satisfies the congruence.
    rcases n with (_ | _ | _ | _ | _ | _ | _ | _ | _ | _ | _) <;>
      simp_all [mul_mod, Nat.mod_eq_of_lt]
  -- We conclude that n % 11 = 8.
