  To solve the congruence \(3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\), we need to find the integer \(n\) such that \(3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\). We can use the properties of modular arithmetic to find the solution. Specifically, we need to determine the multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 11 and then multiply both sides of the congruence by this inverse.
  
  The inverse of 3 modulo 11 is a number \(x\) such that \(3x \equiv 1 \pmod{11}\). By trial, we find that \(x = 5\) because:
  \[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \equiv 1 \pmod{11} \]
  Thus, multiplying both sides of the congruence \(3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\) by 5, we get:
  \[ n \equiv 2 \times 5 \pmod{11} \]
  \[ n \equiv 10 \pmod{11} \]
  Since \(10 \equiv -1 \pmod{11}\), we have:
  \[ n \equiv -1 \pmod{11} \]
  \[ n \equiv 10 \pmod{11} \]
  Finally, we verify that \(n \equiv 8 \pmod{11}\) satisfies the original congruence:
  \[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \equiv 2 \pmod{11} \]
  Thus, the solution to the congruence \(3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\) is \(n \equiv 8 \pmod{11}\).
