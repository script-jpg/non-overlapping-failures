  To solve the congruence \(3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\), we need to find an integer \(n\) such that \(3n - 2\) is divisible by 11. We can use the properties of modular arithmetic to simplify the problem. Specifically, we need to find \(n\) such that \(3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\).
  First, we note that \(3 \times 3 = 9\) and \(9 \equiv -2 \pmod{11}\). Therefore, we can multiply both sides of the congruence \(3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\) by 3:
  \[
  3 \times 3n \equiv 3 \times 2 \pmod{11}
  \]
  This simplifies to:
  \[
  9n \equiv 6 \pmod{11}
  \]
  Since \(9 \equiv -2 \pmod{11}\), we can rewrite the congruence as:
  \[
  -2n \equiv 6 \pmod{11}
  \]
  To solve for \(n\), we multiply both sides by the modular inverse of -2 modulo 11, which is 6 (since \(-2 \times 6 \equiv 1 \pmod{11}\)):
  \[
  n \equiv 6 \times 6 \pmod{11}
  \]
  This simplifies to:
  \[
  n \equiv 36 \pmod{11}
  \]
  Since \(36 \equiv 11 \pmod{11}\), we get:
  \[
  n \equiv 11 \pmod{11}
  \]
  Thus, the solution is \(n \equiv 11 \pmod{11}\). Since \(11 \equiv 0 \pmod{11}\), the smaller solution is \(n \equiv 0 \pmod{11}\). However, we need to verify that \(n \equiv 8 \pmod{11}\). Given the congruence \(3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\), we can use the fact that \(3 \times 8 = 24 \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\), confirming that \(n \equiv 8 \pmod{11}\).
