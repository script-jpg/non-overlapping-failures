  To solve the congruence \(3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\), we need to find an integer \(n\) such that \(3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\). This can be done by finding the multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 11 and then multiplying both sides of the congruence by this inverse. The multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 11 is 4, because \(3 \times 4 \equiv 1 \pmod{11}\). Therefore, multiplying both sides of \(3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\) by 4, we get \(n \equiv 2 \times 4 \pmod{11}\), which simplifies to \(n \equiv 8 \pmod{11}\).

  -- We know that 3 modulo 11 is 3, so we use this fact in our proof.
  have : 3 % 11 = 3 := rfl
  -- We use the `omega` tactic to solve the congruence. The `omega` tactic is a decision procedure for integer linear arithmetic, which can solve this type of problem automatically.
