  To solve the congruence \(3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\), we need to find an integer \(n\) such that \(3n - 2\) is divisible by 11. We can express \(n\) in the form \(n = 11k + r\) where \(r\) is the remainder when \(n\) is divided by 11. Substituting this into the congruence, we get:
  \[ 3(11k + r) \equiv 2 \pmod{11} \]
  Simplifying, we have:
  \[ 33k + 3r \equiv 2 \pmod{11} \]
  Since \(33 \equiv 0 \pmod{11}\), this simplifies to:
  \[ 3r \equiv 2 \pmod{11} \]
  To solve for \(r\), we need the multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 11. The inverse of 3 modulo 11 is a number \(x\) such that \(3x \equiv 1 \pmod{11}\). By testing values, we find that \(x = 4\) because:
  \[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \equiv 1 \pmod{11} \]
  Thus, multiplying both sides of the congruence \(3r \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\) by 4, we get:
  \[ r \equiv 2 \times 4 \pmod{11} \]
  \[ r \equiv 8 \pmod{11} \]
  Therefore, the solution to the congruence is \(n \equiv 8 \pmod{11}\).
