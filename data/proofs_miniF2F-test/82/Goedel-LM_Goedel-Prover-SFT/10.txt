  To solve the congruence \(3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\), we need to find the value of \(n\) modulo 11 such that the congruence holds. Given that \(3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\), we can use the properties of modular arithmetic to solve for \(n\).
  First, we note that \(3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\) implies that \(3n = 11k + 2\) for some integer \(k\). We can then use the fact that \(3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\) to find the specific value of \(n\) modulo 11.
  By examining the congruence \(3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\), we can see that if \(n \equiv 8 \pmod{11}\), then:
  \[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \equiv 2 \pmod{11} \]
  Thus, \(n \equiv 8 \pmod{11}\).
