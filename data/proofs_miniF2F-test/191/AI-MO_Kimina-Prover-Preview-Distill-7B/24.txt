-- We want to find the value of $121 \cdot 122 \cdot 123$ modulo 4.

  have h1 : 121 % 4 = 1 := by norm_num
  have h2 : 122 % 4 = 2 := by norm_num
  have h3 : 123 % 4 = 3 := by norm_num

  -- Now we multiply these residues and take the result modulo 4.
  have h4 : (1 * 2 % 4) = 2 := by norm_num
  have h5 : (2 * 3 % 4) = 2 := by norm_num

  -- Therefore, $121 \cdot 122 \cdot 123 \equiv 2 \pmod{4}$.
  exact h5
```

This solution is straightforward. We first compute the residues of each factor modulo 4, and then multiply these residues together, taking the result modulo 4 at each step to simplify the calculation.

/-- Find the modulo 4 residue of $121 \cdot 122 \cdot 123$. Show that it is 2.-/

  -- We want to compute (121 * 122 * 123) % 4
  -- We can compute each number modulo 4 first:
