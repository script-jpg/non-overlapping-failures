We start by simplifying the problem using modular arithmetic properties. Since we want to find $121 \cdot 122 \cdot 123 \bmod 4$, we can first find the residues of each individual number modulo 4, then multiply them, and finally take the result modulo 4 again. This is due to the property that $(a \cdot b) \bmod m = ((a \bmod m) \cdot (b \bmod m)) \bmod m$.

Let's continue with the calculation:

```tactics
_ = (1 * (2 * 3)) % 4 := by
  norm_num
```

Here, we've determined that:
- $121 \bmod 4 = 1$ (since $121 = 4 \cdot 30 + 1$)
- $122 \bmod 4 = 2$ (since $122 = 4 \cdot 30 + 2$)
- $123 \bmod 4 = 3$ (since $123 = 4 \cdot 30 + 3$)

So $(121 \cdot 122 \cdot 123) \bmod 4 = (1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3) \bmod 4 = 6 \bmod 4 = 2$.

Let's finish the proof:

```tactics
_ = 6 % 4 := by
  norm_num
_ = 2 := by
  norm_num
```

The `norm_num` tactic is powerful for solving arithmetic goals. It automatically computes that $2 \cdot 3 = 6$ and $6 \bmod 4 = 2$.

Therefore, we've proven that $121 \cdot 122 \cdot 123 \bmod 4 = 2$.

The key insight in this problem is that to find the residue of a product modulo a number, we can find the residues of the factors modulo that number and multiply them, then take the result modulo that number again. This simplifies calculations, especially when dealing with large numbers.
