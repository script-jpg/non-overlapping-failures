The proof is quite straightforward. To find $121 \cdot 122 \cdot 123 \bmod 4$, we can first find each factor modulo 4:
- $121 \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$ (since $121 = 30 \cdot 4 + 1$)
- $122 \equiv 2 \pmod{4}$ (since $122 = 30 \cdot 4 + 2$)
- $123 \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$ (since $123 = 30 \cdot 4 + 3$)

Then, we multiply these residues: $1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \equiv 6 \pmod{4}$. 
Since $6 \equiv 2 \pmod{4}$ (as $6 = 1 \cdot 4 + 2$), we have $121 \cdot 122 \cdot 123 \equiv 2 \pmod{4}$.

The Lean proof uses `norm_num` to perform these arithmetic calculations automatically. This tactic is powerful for solving goals involving concrete natural numbers and arithmetic operations. It will compute the exact value of $121 \cdot 122 \cdot 123 \bmod 4$ and verify that it equals 2.

Thus, the complete proof is:

The `norm_num` tactic is sufficient to solve this problem because it can compute arithmetic goals involving concrete numbers. It will calculate $121 \cdot 122 \cdot 123$, take the remainder when divided by 4, and verify that it is equal to 2.
