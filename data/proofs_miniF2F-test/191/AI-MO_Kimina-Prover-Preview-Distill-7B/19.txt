-- We want to find the value of (121 * 122 * 123) modulo 4 and show that it is 2.

  -- First, let's understand the problem:
  -- We have three consecutive numbers: 121, 122, 123
  -- We need to find the product modulo 4
  -- We expect the result to be 2

  -- A straightforward approach is to calculate the product directly and then compute the remainder when divided by 4.
  norm_num

  -- The `norm_num` tactic is powerful for arithmetic goals. It will:
  -- 1. Calculate the product 121 * 122 * 123 = 1,860,666
  -- 2. Compute 1,860,666 mod 4
  -- 3. Verify that the result equals 2

  -- Let's think about this problem mathematically to verify the answer:
  -- 121 ≡ 1 (mod 4) because 121 = 4 * 30 + 1
  -- 122 ≡ 2 (mod 4) because 122 = 4 * 30 + 2
  -- 123 ≡ 3 (mod 4) because 123 = 4 * 30 + 3
  -- So, 121 * 122 * 123 ≡ 1 * 2 * 3 ≡ 6 ≡ 2 (mod 4)
  -- (since 6 = 4 + 2)

  -- The `norm_num` tactic performs these calculations automatically and confirms the result is indeed 2.

  -- Therefore, we have proved that 121 * 122 * 123 ≡ 2 (mod 4)
