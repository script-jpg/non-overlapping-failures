  To find the modulo 4 residue of \(121 \cdot 122 \cdot 123\), we can simplify the expression step by step. First, we compute the modulo 4 residues of each number:
  - \(121 \equiv 1 \pmod{4}\)
  - \(122 \equiv 2 \pmod{4}\)
  - \(123 \equiv 3 \pmod{4}\)
  Next, we multiply these residues together and compute the result modulo 4:
  \[
  1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 = 6
  \]
  Finally, we find \(6 \mod 4\):
  \[
  6 \equiv 2 \pmod{4}
  \]
  Thus, the modulo 4 residue of \(121 \cdot 122 \cdot 123\) is 2.

  norm_num
  -- The `norm_num` tactic will simplify the expression and confirm that the modulo 4 residue is 2.
  <;> assumption
  -- The `assumption` tactic is used to close the goal since `norm_num` has already provided the necessary proof.
  <;> rfl
  -- The `rfl` tactic is used to confirm that the left-hand side equals the right-hand side, which is already true by the previous steps.
