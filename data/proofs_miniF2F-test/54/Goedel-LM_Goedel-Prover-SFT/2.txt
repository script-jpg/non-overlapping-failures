  To determine the units digit of \(2^{2010}\), we need to find \(2^{2010} \mod 10\). We observe that the units digit of powers of 2 cycles every 4 terms:
  - \(2^1 = 2\) (units digit is 2)
  - \(2^2 = 4\) (units digit is 4)
  - \(2^3 = 8\) (units digit is 8)
  - \(2^4 = 16\) (units digit is 6)
  - \(2^5 = 32\) (units digit is 2)
  - and so on...
  Thus, the units digit of \(2^n\) is the same as the units digit of \(2^{n \mod 4}\). Since \(2010 \mod 4 = 2\), the units digit of \(2^{2010}\) is the same as the units digit of \(2^2\), which is 4.

  -- Since 2010 % 4 = 2, we need to find the units digit of 2^2, which is 4.
