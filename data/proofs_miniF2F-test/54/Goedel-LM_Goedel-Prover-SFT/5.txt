  To determine the units digit of \(2^{2010}\), we need to find \(2^{2010} \mod 10\). We observe that the units digit of powers of 2 follows a repeating cycle:
  - \(2^1 = 2\) (units digit is 2)
  - \(2^2 = 4\) (units digit is 4)
  - \(2^3 = 8\) (units digit is 8)
  - \(2^4 = 16\) (units digit is 6)
  - \(2^5 = 32\) (units digit is 2, repeating the cycle)
  Thus, the units digit of \(2^n\) depends on \(n \mod 4\):
  - If \(n \equiv 0 \mod 4\), the units digit is 6.
  - If \(n \equiv 1 \mod 4\), the units digit is 2.
  - If \(n \equiv 2 \mod 4\), the units digit is 4.
  - If \(n \equiv 3 \mod 4\), the units digit is 8.
  Since \(2010 \mod 4 = 2\), the units digit of \(2^{2010}\) is the same as the units digit of \(2^2\), which is 4.
