  To determine the units digit of \(2^{2010}\), we need to find \(2^{2010} \mod 10\). We observe that the units digits of powers of 2 cycle every 4 terms:
  - \(2^1 \equiv 2 \mod 10\)
  - \(2^2 \equiv 4 \mod 10\)
  - \(2^3 \equiv 8 \mod 10\)
  - \(2^4 \equiv 16 \equiv 6 \mod 10\)
  - \(2^5 \equiv 2 \mod 10\)
  - and so on...
  Thus, the units digits repeat every 4 terms: \(2, 4, 8, 6\). To find \(2^{2010} \mod 10\), we compute the remainder of 2010 divided by 4:
  \[ 2010 \div 4 = 502 \text{ remainder } 2 \]
  So, \(2010 \equiv 2 \mod 4\). Therefore, the units digit of \(2^{2010}\) is the same as the units digit of \(2^2\), which is 4.

  -- The units digits of powers of 2 cycle every 4 terms: 2, 4, 8, 6.
  -- Since 2010 % 4 = 2, the units digit of 2^2010 is the same as the units digit of 2^2, which is 4.
