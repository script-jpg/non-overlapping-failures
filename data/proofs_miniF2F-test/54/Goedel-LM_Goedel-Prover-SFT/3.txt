  To determine the units digit of \(2^{2010}\), we need to find \(2^{2010} \mod 10\). We observe that the units digits of powers of 2 cycle every 4 terms:
  - \(2^1 = 2\) (units digit is 2)
  - \(2^2 = 4\) (units digit is 4)
  - \(2^3 = 8\) (units digit is 8)
  - \(2^4 = 16\) (units digit is 6)
  - \(2^5 = 32\) (units digit is 2)
  - and so on...
  Thus, the units digits repeat every 4 powers. To find \(2^{2010} \mod 10\), we can reduce the exponent modulo 4:
  - \(2010 \mod 4 = 2\)
  Therefore, \(2^{2010} \mod 10\) is the same as \(2^2 \mod 10\), which is 4.

  -- We need to find the units digit of 2^2010, which is equivalent to finding 2^2010 % 10.
  -- The units digits of powers of 2 cycle every 4 terms: 2, 4, 8, 6.
  -- Therefore, to find the units digit of 2^2010, we can reduce the exponent modulo 4.
  -- 2010 % 4 = 2, so the units digit of 2^2010 is the same as the units digit of 2^2.
  -- The units digit of 2^2 is 4.
