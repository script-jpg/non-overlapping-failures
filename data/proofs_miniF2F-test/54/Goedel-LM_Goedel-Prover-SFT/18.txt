  To determine the units digit of \(2^{2010}\), we need to find \(2^{2010} \mod 10\). We observe that the units digit of powers of 2 follows a pattern:
  - \(2^1 = 2\) (units digit is 2)
  - \(2^2 = 4\) (units digit is 4)
  - \(2^3 = 8\) (units digit is 8)
  - \(2^4 = 16\) (units digit is 6)
  - \(2^5 = 32\) (units digit is 2, repeating the cycle)
  The units digits repeat every 4 powers. Therefore, to find \(2^{2010} \mod 10\), we can reduce the exponent modulo 4:
  - \(2010 \mod 4 = 2\)
  Thus, \(2^{2010} \equiv 2^2 \mod 10\), and since \(2^2 = 4\), the units digit of \(2^{2010}\) is 4.

  simp [Nat.pow_mod, show 2 ^ 2 % 10 = 4 by norm_num, show 2 ^ 3 % 10 = 8 by norm_num]
  -- Since the units digits repeat every 4 powers, we can reduce 2010 modulo 4.
  -- 2010 % 4 = 2, so 2^2010 % 10 = 2^2 % 10 = 4.
