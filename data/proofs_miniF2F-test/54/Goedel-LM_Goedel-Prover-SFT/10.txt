  To determine the units digit of \(2^{2010}\), we need to find \(2^{2010} \mod 10\). We observe the pattern in the units digits of powers of 2:
  - \(2^1 = 2\) (units digit is 2)
  - \(2^2 = 4\) (units digit is 4)
  - \(2^3 = 8\) (units digit is 8)
  - \(2^4 = 16\) (units digit is 6)
  - \(2^5 = 32\) (units digit is 2, repeating the cycle)
  The units digits repeat every 4 powers: 2, 4, 8, 6. To find the units digit of \(2^{2010}\), we determine the position of 2010 in the cycle by computing \(2010 \mod 4\). Since \(2010 \div 4 = 502\) remainder 2, \(2010 \equiv 2 \mod 4\). Therefore, the units digit of \(2^{2010}\) is the same as the units digit of \(2^2\), which is 4.
