  To determine the units digit of \(2^{2010}\), we need to find \(2^{2010} \mod 10\). We observe the pattern in the units digits of powers of 2:
  - \(2^1 = 2\) (units digit is 2)
  - \(2^2 = 4\) (units digit is 4)
  - \(2^3 = 8\) (units digit is 8)
  - \(2^4 = 16\) (units digit is 6)
  - \(2^5 = 32\) (units digit is 2, and the pattern repeats)
  The units digits repeat every 4 powers. Therefore, to find \(2^{2010} \mod 10\), we can reduce the exponent modulo 4:
  - \(2010 \mod 4 = 2\)
  Thus, \(2^{2010} \equiv 2^2 \mod 10\). From our pattern, \(2^2 \mod 10 = 4\). Therefore, the units digit of \(2^{2010}\) is 4.
