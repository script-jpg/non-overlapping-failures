  To determine the units digit of \(2^{2010}\), we need to find \(2^{2010} \mod 10\). We observe the pattern in the units digits of powers of 2:
  - \(2^1 = 2\) (units digit is 2)
  - \(2^2 = 4\) (units digit is 4)
  - \(2^3 = 8\) (units digit is 8)
  - \(2^4 = 16\) (units digit is 6)
  - \(2^5 = 32\) (units digit is 2)
  The units digits repeat every 4 powers: 2, 4, 8, 6. To find \(2^{2010} \mod 10\), we note that 2010 modulo 4 is 2. Therefore, the units digit of \(2^{2010}\) is the same as the units digit of \(2^2\), which is 4.

  -- We use norm_num to compute the result directly.
  -- The units digits of powers of 2 repeat every 4 terms: 2, 4, 8, 6.
  -- Since 2010 % 4 = 2, the units digit of 2^2010 is the same as the units digit of 2^2, which is 4.
