  To determine the units digit of \(2^{2010}\), we need to find \(2^{2010} \mod 10\). We observe the pattern in the units digits of powers of 2:
  - \(2^1 = 2\) (units digit is 2)
  - \(2^2 = 4\) (units digit is 4)
  - \(2^3 = 8\) (units digit is 8)
  - \(2^4 = 16\) (units digit is 6)
  - \(2^5 = 32\) (units digit is 2)
  - \(2^6 = 64\) (units digit is 4)
  - \(2^7 = 128\) (units digit is 8)
  - \(2^8 = 256\) (units digit is 6)
  From this pattern, we see that the units digits repeat every 4 powers. Specifically, the sequence of units digits is 2, 4, 8, 6, and this pattern repeats.
  Given \(2^{2010}\), we can determine the position of \(2^{2010}\) in the cycle by finding \(2010 \mod 4\). Since \(2010 \div 4 = 502\) remainder \(2\), \(2010 \equiv 2 \mod 4\). Therefore, \(2^{2010}\) corresponds to \(2^2\) in the cycle, which has a units digit of 4.

  -- We need to find 2^2010 % 10. We observe that the units digits of powers of 2 repeat every 4 cycles: 2, 4, 8, 6.
  have h : 2 ^ 2010 % 10 = 2 ^ 2 % 10 := by
    -- Since 2010 % 4 = 2, 2^2010 % 10 is the same as 2^2 % 10.
