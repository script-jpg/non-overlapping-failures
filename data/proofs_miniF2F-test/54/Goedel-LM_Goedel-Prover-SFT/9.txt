  To determine the units digit of \(2^{2010}\), we need to find \(2^{2010} \mod 10\). We observe that the units digits of powers of 2 cycle every 4 terms:
  - \(2^1 = 2\) (units digit is 2)
  - \(2^2 = 4\) (units digit is 4)
  - \(2^3 = 8\) (units digit is 8)
  - \(2^4 = 16\) (units digit is 6)
  - \(2^5 = 32\) (units digit is 2)
  - \(2^6 = 64\) (units digit is 4)
  - \(2^7 = 128\) (units digit is 8)
  - \(2^8 = 256\) (units digit is 6)
  Thus, the units digits repeat every 4 terms: 2, 4, 8, 6. To find \(2^{2010} \mod 10\), we determine the position of 2010 in this cycle by computing \(2010 \mod 4\). Since \(2010 \mod 4 = 2\), the units digit of \(2^{2010}\) is the same as the units digit of \(2^2\), which is 4.
