-- We want to find the units digit of $2^{2010}$, which is equivalent to finding $2^{2010} \bmod 10$.
  -- To solve this, we first observe the pattern of the units digit of powers of 2:
  --
  -- - $2^1 = 2$, units digit is 2
  -- - $2^2 = 4$, units digit is 4
  -- - $2^3 = 8$, units digit is 8
  -- - $2^4 = 16$, units digit is 6
  -- - $2^5 = 32$, units digit is 2
  --
  -- We notice a repeating cycle: 2, 4, 8, 6, and this cycle has a length of 4.
  have h1 : 2 ^ 2010 % 10 = 4 := by
    -- Since the cycle length is 4, we can reduce the exponent 2010 modulo 4:
    -- $2010 \div 4 = 502$ remainder $2$.
    -- Therefore, $2^{2010} \equiv 2^{2} \pmod{10}$.
    -- And $2^2 = 4$, so $2^{2010} \equiv 4 \pmod{10}$.
