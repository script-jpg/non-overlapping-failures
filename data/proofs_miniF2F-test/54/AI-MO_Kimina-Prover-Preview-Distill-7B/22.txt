-- We show that the units digit of a number is the remainder when the number is divided by 10.
  have h1 : Nat.mod 10 = Nat.mod 10 := rfl

  -- We calculate the remainder of $2^{2010}$ when divided by 10.
  have h2 : 2 ^ 2010 % 10 = 4 := by
    -- We note that the remainder of $2^n$ when divided by 10 is 2, 4, 8, or 6, repeating every 4 powers.
    -- Since $2010 = 4 \cdot 502 + 2$, we have $2^{2010} \equiv 2^2 \pmod{10}$.

  -- We complete the proof by substituting the calculated value.
