-- What is the units digit of $2^{2010}$? Show that it is 4.

  -- The pattern of $2^x$ modulo 10 is: $2^1 \equiv 2$, $2^2 \equiv 4$, $2^3 \equiv 8$, $2^4 \equiv 6$, and then it repeats every 4.

  -- So we know that if we have $2^x$ where $x$ is a multiple of 4, then it will be equivalent to 6 modulo 10.

  -- We've been given $2^{2010}$ and we need to find its units digit, which is equivalent to finding $2^{2010}$ modulo 10.

  -- 2010 divided by 4 gives a remainder of 2. So $2^{2010}$ is equivalent to $2^2$ modulo 10, which is 4.
