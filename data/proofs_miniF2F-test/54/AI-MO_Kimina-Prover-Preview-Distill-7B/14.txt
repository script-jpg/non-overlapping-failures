-- We know that the units digit of a number is its remainder when divided by 10.
  -- We will try to find a pattern in the units digits of powers of 2.

  -- 2^1 = 2, remainder 2 when divided by 10
  -- 2^2 = 4, remainder 4 when divided by 10
  -- 2^3 = 8, remainder 8 when divided by 10
  -- 2^4 = 16, remainder 6 when divided by 10
  -- 2^5 = 32, remainder 2 when divided by 10

  -- We see that the units digits form a cycle of length 4: 2, 4, 8, 6

  -- To find the units digit of 2^2010, we need to determine its position in this cycle.
  -- We do this by computing 2010 modulo 4.

  have : 2010 % 4 = 2 := by norm_num

  -- 2010 ≡ 2 (mod 4), so 2^2010 has the same units digit as 2^2
  -- From our pattern observation, the units digit of 2^2 is 4.

  -- We will now complete the proof by showing that 2^2010 % 10 = 4.
  have : 2 ^ 2010 % 10 = 4 := by
    -- We could try to compute this directly, but since 2^2010 is a large number,
    -- we will use the properties of modular arithmetic to simplify the calculation.
    rw [pow_succ]
    have : 2 ^ 2009 % 10 = 8 := by
      -- By the same reasoning as above, we can determine that 2^2009 % 10 = 8
      have h1 : 2009 % 4 = 1 := by norm_num
      have h2 : 2 ^ 2009 % 10 = 2 ^ (4 * 502 + 1) % 10 := by norm_num
