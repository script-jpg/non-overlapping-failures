  Given the complex numbers \( V = 1 + i \) and \( Z = 2 - i \), we need to find the current \( I \) in the equation \( V = IZ \). Substituting the given values into the equation, we get \( 1 + i = I(2 - i) \). To solve for \( I \), we multiply both sides by the conjugate of \( Z \) to simplify the right-hand side:
  \[
  (1 + i)(2 + i) = I(2 - i)(2 + i)
  \]
  Expanding both sides:
  \[
  (1 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot i + i \cdot 2 + i \cdot i) = I(2^2 - i^2)
  \]
  \[
  (2 + i + 2i + i^2) = I(4 - (-1))
  \]
  \[
  (2 + 3i - 1) = I(4 + 1)
  \]
  \[
  1 + 3i = I \cdot 5
  \]
  Solving for \( I \):
  \[
  I = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{3}{5}i
  \]
