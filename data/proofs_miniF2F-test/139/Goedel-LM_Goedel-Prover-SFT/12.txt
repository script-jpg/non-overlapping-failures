  Given the circuit with voltage \( V = 1 + i \) and impedance \( Z = 2 - i \), we need to find the current \( I \). Using the relationship \( V = IZ \), we substitute the given values and solve for \( I \).
  1. Substitute \( V = 1 + i \) and \( Z = 2 - i \) into the equation \( V = IZ \).
  2. This gives \( 1 + i = I(2 - i) \).
  3. Expand and simplify the equation to isolate \( I \).
  4. Solve the resulting system of equations for \( I \) by equating the real and imaginary parts.
