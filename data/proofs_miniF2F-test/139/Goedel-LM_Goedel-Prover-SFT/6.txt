  Given the equation \( V = IZ \), where \( V \) is the voltage, \( I \) is the current, and \( Z \) is the impedance, we need to find the current \( I \). We are provided with the specific values \( V = 1 + i \) and \( Z = 2 - i \). To solve for \( I \), we substitute these values into the equation \( V = IZ \).
  First, we express \( I \) in terms of \( V \) and \( Z \):
  \[ I = \frac{V}{Z} \]
  Substituting \( V = 1 + i \) and \( Z = 2 - i \):
  \[ I = \frac{1 + i}{2 - i} \]
  To simplify this fraction, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:
  \[ I = \frac{(1 + i)(2 + i)}{(2 - i)(2 + i)} \]
  Simplifying the denominator:
  \[ (2 - i)(2 + i) = 2^2 - i^2 = 4 + 1 = 5 \]
  Simplifying the numerator:
  \[ (1 + i)(2 + i) = 1 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot i + i \cdot 2 + i \cdot i = 2 + i + 2i + i^2 = 2 + 3i - 1 = 1 + 3i \]
  Thus, we have:
  \[ I = \frac{1 + 3i}{5} = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{3}{5}i \]
