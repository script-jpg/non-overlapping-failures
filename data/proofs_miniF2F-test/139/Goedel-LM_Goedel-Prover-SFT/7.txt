  Given the equation \( V = IZ \) where \( V \) is voltage, \( I \) is current, and \( Z \) is impedance, we need to find \( I \) when \( V = 1 + i \) and \( Z = 2 - i \). We are to show that \( I = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{3}{5}i \).
  First, substitute the given values \( V = 1 + i \) and \( Z = 2 - i \) into the equation \( V = IZ \):
  \[ 1 + i = I(2 - i) \]
  Next, solve for \( I \) by isolating it on one side of the equation:
  \[ I = \frac{1 + i}{2 - i} \]
  To simplify the fraction, multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:
  \[ I = \frac{(1 + i)(2 + i)}{(2 - i)(2 + i)} \]
  Calculate the denominator:
  \[ (2 - i)(2 + i) = 2^2 - i^2 = 4 - (-1) = 4 + 1 = 5 \]
  Calculate the numerator:
  \[ (1 + i)(2 + i) = 1 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot i + i \cdot 2 + i \cdot i = 2 + i + 2i + i^2 = 2 + 3i - 1 = 1 + 3i \]
  Thus, the expression for \( I \) becomes:
  \[ I = \frac{1 + 3i}{5} = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{3}{5}i \]
  Therefore, the current \( I \) is indeed \( \frac{1}{5} + \frac{3}{5}i \).
