  Given the voltage \( V = 1 + i \), impedance \( Z = 2 - i \), and current \( I = V \cdot Z^{-1} \), we need to find \( I \) and show that it equals \( \frac{1}{5} + \frac{3}{5}i \).
  1. Substitute the given values of \( V \) and \( Z \) into the equation \( V = I \cdot Z \).
  2. Compute the inverse of \( Z \) and multiply by \( V \) to find \( I \).
  3. Simplify the resulting expression to match the given form \( \frac{1}{5} + \frac{3}{5}i \).
