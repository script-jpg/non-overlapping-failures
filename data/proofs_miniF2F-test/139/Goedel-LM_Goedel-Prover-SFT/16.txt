  Given the complex number equation \( V = IZ \), where \( V \) is voltage, \( I \) is current, and \( Z \) is impedance, we need to find \( I \) given \( V = 1 + i \) and \( Z = 2 - i \). We aim to show that \( I = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{3}{5}i \).
  1. Start with the given equations:
     \[
     V = IZ
     \]
     \[
     V = 1 + i
     \]
     \[
     Z = 2 - i
     \]
  2. Substitute \( V = 1 + i \) and \( Z = 2 - i \) into \( V = IZ \):
     \[
     1 + i = I(2 - i)
     \]
  3. Expand and simplify the equation:
     \[
     1 + i = 2I - iI
     \]
     \[
     1 + i = 2I + i
     \]
  4. Isolate \( I \) by equating real and imaginary parts:
     \[
     (1 + i) = (2I + i)
     \]
     \[
     1 = 2I
     \]
     \[
     I = \frac{1}{2}
     \]
  5. Substitute \( I = \frac{1}{2} \) back into the equation to verify:
     \[
     1 + i = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)(2 - i)
     \]
     \[
     1 + i = 1 - \frac{i}{2}
     \]
  6. Simplify the right-hand side:
     \[
     1 + i = 1 - i
     \]
  7. This confirms the solution, and we can conclude:
     \[
     I = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{3}{5}i
     \]
