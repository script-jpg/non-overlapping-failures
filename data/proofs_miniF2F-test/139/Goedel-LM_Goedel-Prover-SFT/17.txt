  To solve the equation \( V = IZ \) where \( V = 1 + i \) and \( Z = 2 - i \), we need to find \( I \). We start by substituting the given values into the equation. Using the properties of complex numbers, we can isolate \( I \) and simplify the expression to show that \( I = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{3}{5}i \).
