  Given the equation \( V = IZ \), where \( V \) is the voltage, \( I \) is the current, and \( Z \) is the impedance, we are provided with the following values: \( V = 1 + i \) and \( Z = 2 - i \). We need to find \( I \).
  First, substitute the given values into the equation \( V = IZ \):
  \[ 1 + i = I(2 - i) \]
  Next, solve for \( I \) by isolating \( I \):
  \[ 1 + i = 2I - iI \]
  \[ 1 + i = 2I + I \]
  \[ 1 + i = 2I + i \]
  Subtract \( i \) from both sides:
  \[ 1 = 2I \]
  Divide both sides by 2:
  \[ I = \frac{1}{2} \]
  Thus, the value of \( I \) is \( \frac{1}{5} + \frac{3}{5}i \).
