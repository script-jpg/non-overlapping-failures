  Given the voltage \( V = 1 + i \) and impedance \( Z = 2 - i \), we need to find the current \( I \) in the circuit. Using the relationship \( V = IZ \), we substitute the given values into the equation:
  \[ 1 + i = I \cdot (2 - i) \]
  To solve for \( I \), we multiply both sides by the conjugate of \( Z \) to isolate \( I \):
  \[ I = \frac{1 + i}{2 - i} \]
  We then simplify the right-hand side by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:
  \[ I = \frac{(1 + i)(2 + i)}{(2 - i)(2 + i)} \]
  The denominator simplifies to:
  \[ (2 - i)(2 + i) = 2^2 - i^2 = 4 - (-1) = 4 + 1 = 5 \]
  The numerator simplifies to:
  \[ (1 + i)(2 + i) = 1 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot i + i \cdot 2 + i \cdot i = 2 + i + 2i + i^2 = 2 + 3i - 1 = 1 + 3i \]
  Thus, the current \( I \) is:
  \[ I = \frac{1 + 3i}{5} = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{3i}{5} \]
