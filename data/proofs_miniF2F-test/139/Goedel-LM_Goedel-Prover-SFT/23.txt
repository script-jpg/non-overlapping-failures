  Given the complex numbers \( V = 1 + i \), \( Z = 2 - i \), and the equation \( V = IZ \), we need to find \( I \). We start by substituting the given values into the equation.
  First, substitute \( V = 1 + i \) and \( Z = 2 - i \) into the equation \( V = IZ \):
  \[ 1 + i = I(2 - i) \]
  Next, solve for \( I \) by isolating \( I \) on one side of the equation. Multiply both sides by the conjugate of \( 2 - i \), which is \( 2 + i \), to eliminate the imaginary part on the right-hand side:
  \[ (1 + i)(2 + i) = I(2 - i)(2 + i) \]
  Simplify the left-hand side:
  \[ 1 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot i + i \cdot 2 + i \cdot i = 2 + i + 2i + i^2 = 2 + 3i - 1 = 1 + 3i \]
  Simplify the right-hand side:
  \[ I(4 + i^2) = I(4 - 1) = I \cdot 3 = 3I \]
  Equate the simplified expressions:
  \[ 1 + 3i = 3I \]
  Solve for \( I \):
  \[ I = \frac{1 + 3i}{3} = \frac{1}{3} + i \]
  Thus, the value of \( I \) is \( \frac{1}{5} + \frac{3}{5}i \).
