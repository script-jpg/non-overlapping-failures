  Given the complex numbers \( V = 1 + i \) and \( Z = 2 - i \), we need to find the current \( I \) in the equation \( V = IZ \). We start by substituting the given values of \( V \) and \( Z \) into the equation. This gives us:
  \[ 1 + i = I(2 - i) \]
  Next, we solve for \( I \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by dividing both sides by \( 2 - i \):
  \[ I = \frac{1 + i}{2 - i} \]
  To simplify the right-hand side, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator:
  \[ I = \frac{(1 + i)(2 + i)}{(2 - i)(2 + i)} \]
  The denominator simplifies to:
  \[ (2 - i)(2 + i) = 4 + 1 = 5 \]
  The numerator simplifies to:
  \[ (1 + i)(2 + i) = 1 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot i + i \cdot 2 + i \cdot i = 2 + i + 2i + i^2 = 2 + 3i - 1 = 1 + 3i \]
  Thus, we have:
  \[ I = \frac{1 + 3i}{5} = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{3}{5}i \]
  This completes the proof that \( I = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{3}{5}i \).
