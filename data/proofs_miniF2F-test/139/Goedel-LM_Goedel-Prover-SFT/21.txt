  Given the complex numbers \( V = 1 + i \) and \( Z = 2 - i \), we need to find the current \( I \) such that \( V = IZ \). By substituting the given values into the equation, we have:
  \[ 1 + i = I(2 - i) \]
  To solve for \( I \), we multiply the right-hand side by the conjugate of \( Z \) to simplify the equation:
  \[ 1 + i = I(2 - i) \cdot \frac{2 + i}{2 + i} = I \cdot \frac{(2 - i)(2 + i)}{2^2} = I \cdot \frac{4 + 1}{4} = I \cdot \frac{5}{4} \]
  This simplifies to:
  \[ 1 + i = \frac{5}{4} I \]
  To isolate \( I \), we multiply both sides by 4:
  \[ 4 + 4i = 5 I \]
  Dividing both sides by 5, we get:
  \[ I = \frac{4 + 4i}{5} = \frac{4}{5} + \frac{4i}{5} = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{3}{5}i \]
  Thus, the current \( I \) is \( \frac{1}{5} + \frac{3}{5}i \).
