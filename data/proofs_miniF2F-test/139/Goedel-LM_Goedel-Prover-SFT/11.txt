  Given the complex numbers \( V = 1 + i \), \( I = 2 - i \), and \( Z = 2 - i \), we need to find \( I \) such that \( V = IZ \). By substituting the known values into the equation, we get:
  \[ 1 + i = (2 - i)(2 - i) \]
  Expanding the right-hand side:
  \[ 1 + i = 2^2 - 2i + i^2 \]
  \[ 1 + i = 4 - 2i - 1 \]
  \[ 1 + i = 3 - 2i \]
  To isolate \( I \), we equate the real and imaginary parts:
  \[ 1 = 3 \]
  \[ i = -2i \]
  This implies:
  \[ 1 = 3 \]
  \[ i = -2i \]
  From the imaginary part, we get:
  \[ 1 = 3 \]
  This contradiction suggests a mistake in the initial setup. However, the correct approach should yield:
  \[ I = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{3}{5}i \]
