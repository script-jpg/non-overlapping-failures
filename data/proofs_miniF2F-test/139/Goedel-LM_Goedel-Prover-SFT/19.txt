  Given the voltage \( V \), current \( I \), and impedance \( Z \) in an alternating current (AC) circuit, we know that \( V = IZ \). We are provided with the specific values \( V = 1 + i \) and \( Z = 2 - i \). We need to find the current \( I \).
  First, substitute the given values into the equation \( V = IZ \):
  \[ 1 + i = I(2 - i) \]
  Next, solve for \( I \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. Multiply both sides by the conjugate of \( Z \) (2 + i) to eliminate the imaginary part:
  \[ (1 + i)(2 + i) = I(2 - i)(2 + i) \]
  Simplify the left-hand side:
  \[ (1 + i)(2 + i) = 1 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot i + i \cdot 2 + i \cdot i = 2 + i + 2i + i^2 = 2 + 3i - 1 = 1 + 3i \]
  Simplify the right-hand side:
  \[ I(2 - i)(2 + i) = I(2^2 - i^2) = I(4 - (-1)) = I(4 + 1) = I \cdot 5 = 5I \]
  Equate the two sides:
  \[ 1 + 3i = 5I \]
  Solve for \( I \):
  \[ I = \frac{1 + 3i}{5} = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{3i}{5} = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{3}{5}i \]
  Thus, the current \( I \) is \( \frac{1}{5} + \frac{3}{5}i \).
