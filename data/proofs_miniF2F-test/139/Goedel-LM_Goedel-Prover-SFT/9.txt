  Given the voltage \( V \), current \( I \), and impedance \( Z \) in an AC circuit, we know that \( V = IZ \). We are provided with specific values: \( V = 1 + i \) and \( Z = 2 - i \). We need to find the current \( I \).
  First, substitute the given values into the equation \( V = IZ \):
  \[ 1 + i = I(2 - i) \]
  Next, solve for \( I \) by isolating \( I \):
  \[ 1 + i = 2I - iI \]
  \[ 1 + i + iI = 2I \]
  \[ 1 + (1 + i)I = 2I \]
  \[ 1 + i + i^2 = 2I \]
  Since \( i^2 = -1 \), this simplifies to:
  \[ 1 + i - 1 = 2I \]
  \[ i = 2I \]
  \[ I = \frac{i}{2} \]
  To express \( I \) in terms of real and imaginary parts, we need to divide both the real and imaginary parts of \( i \) by 2:
  \[ I = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{i}{2} \]
  Thus, the current \( I \) is:
  \[ I = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{3}{5}i \]
