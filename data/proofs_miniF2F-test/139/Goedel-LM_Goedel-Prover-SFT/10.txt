  Given the equation \( V = IZ \), where \( V \) is voltage, \( I \) is current, and \( Z \) is impedance, we are provided with the specific values \( V = 1 + i \) and \( Z = 2 - i \). We need to find \( I \) and show that it equals \( \frac{1}{5} + \frac{3}{5}i \).
  1. Substitute the given values \( V = 1 + i \) and \( Z = 2 - i \) into the equation \( V = IZ \).
  2. This results in the equation \( 1 + i = I(2 - i) \).
  3. Solve for \( I \) by isolating \( I \) on one side of the equation.
  4. Expand and simplify the equation to find the values of the real and imaginary parts of \( I \).
  5. Verify that the real part is \( \frac{1}{5} \) and the imaginary part is \( \frac{3}{5} \).
