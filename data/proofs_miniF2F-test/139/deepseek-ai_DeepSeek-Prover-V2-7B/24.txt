have h₃ : i = 1 / 5 + 3 / 5 * Complex.I := by
    subst_vars
    -- Now we have the equation (1 + i) = i * (2 - i)
    -- We need to solve for i
    -- Expand the right-hand side: i * (2 - i) = 2i - i^2
    -- Recall that i^2 = -1, so we have 2i - (-1) = 2i + 1
    -- Set the equation to (1 + i) = 2i + 1
    -- Subtract 1 from both sides: 1 + i - 1 = 2i + 1 - 1 => i = 2i
    -- Subtract 2i from both sides: i - 2i = 2i - 2i => -i = 0
    -- This implies i = 0, which is incorrect. Recheck the steps.
    -- Alternatively, simplify the original equation by substituting the known values and solving for i.
