-- We want to rearrange $V = IZ$ to find $I$. We have $V = 1 + i$ and $Z = 2 - i$.

  -- The first step is to isolate $I$ in the equation $V = IZ$.

  -- Now we have $I = (1+i)/(2-i)$.

  -- To simplify this, we multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is $2+i$.
