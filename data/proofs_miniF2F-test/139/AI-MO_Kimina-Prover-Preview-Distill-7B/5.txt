-- First, we substitute the given values of $V$ and $Z$ into the equation $V=I \cdot Z$.
  rw[h₁,h₂] at h₀

  -- Now we need to solve for $I$. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by $Z$.
  have h₃ : i = (1 + Complex.I) / (2 - Complex.I) := by

  -- Now we simplify the expression. Recall that the division of two complex numbers $a+bi$ and $c+di$ can be performed by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator: $\frac{a+bi}{c+di} = \frac{(a+bi)(c-di)}{(c+di)(c-di)}$.
