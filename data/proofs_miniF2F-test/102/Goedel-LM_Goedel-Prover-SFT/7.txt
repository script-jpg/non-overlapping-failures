  To solve for \( y \) in the equation \(\sqrt{19 + 3y} = 7\), we start by ensuring that the square root is applied correctly. We know that \(\sqrt{19 + 3y} = 7\) implies \(19 + 3y = 49\). Solving for \( y \), we subtract 19 from both sides to get \(3y = 30\), and then divide by 3 to find \( y = 10 \).
