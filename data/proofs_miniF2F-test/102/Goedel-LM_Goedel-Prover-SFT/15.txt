  Given the equation \(\sqrt{19 + 3y} = 7\), we need to find the value of \(y\). First, we square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root, yielding \(19 + 3y = 49\). Next, we isolate \(y\) by subtracting 19 from both sides, resulting in \(3y = 30\). Finally, we solve for \(y\) by dividing both sides by 3, obtaining \(y = 10\).
