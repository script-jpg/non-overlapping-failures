  To solve for \( y \) in the equation \(\sqrt{19 + 3y} = 7\), we start by squaring both sides to eliminate the square root. This gives us \(19 + 3y = 49\). Next, we isolate \( y \) by subtracting 19 from both sides, resulting in \(3y = 30\). Finally, we divide both sides by 3 to find \( y = 10 \).
