  Given the equation \(\sqrt{19 + 3y} = 7\), we need to find the value of \(y\). First, we square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root, resulting in \(19 + 3y = 49\). Next, we solve for \(y\) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 19 from both sides, yielding \(3y = 30\). Finally, we divide both sides by 3 to obtain \(y = 10\).
