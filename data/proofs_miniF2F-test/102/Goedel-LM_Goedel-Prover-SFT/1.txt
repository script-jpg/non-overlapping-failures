  To solve for \( y \) in the equation \( \sqrt{19 + 3y} = 7 \), we start by squaring both sides to eliminate the square root. This gives us \( 19 + 3y = 49 \). Next, we isolate \( y \) by subtracting 19 from both sides, resulting in \( 3y = 30 \). Finally, we solve for \( y \) by dividing both sides by 3, yielding \( y = 10 \).

  have h₀ : 0 ≤ 19 + 3 * y := by linarith
  have h₁ : 19 + 3 * y = 49 := by
    nlinarith [sq_sqrt (by linarith : 0 ≤ 19 + 3 * y)]
  -- Isolate y by subtracting 19 from both sides.
  have h₂ : 3 * y = 30 := by
    linarith
  -- Solve for y by dividing both sides by 3.
