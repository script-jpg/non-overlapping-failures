  To solve the equation \(\sqrt{19 + 3y} = 7\), we start by squaring both sides to eliminate the square root. This gives us the equation \(19 + 3y = 49\). Next, we isolate \(y\) by subtracting 19 from both sides, resulting in \(3y = 30\). Finally, we solve for \(y\) by dividing both sides by 3, yielding \(y = 10\).
