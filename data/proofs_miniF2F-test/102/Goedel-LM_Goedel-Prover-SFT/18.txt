  To solve for \( y \):
  1. Start with the equation \(\sqrt{19 + 3y} = 7\).
  2. Square both sides to eliminate the square root: \(19 + 3y = 49\).
  3. Subtract 19 from both sides: \(3y = 30\).
  4. Divide both sides by 3: \(y = 10\).
  -/
  -- Square both sides to eliminate the square root.
  have h₂ : 0 ≤ 19 + 3 * y := by assumption
  have h₃ : 0 ≤ 19 + 3 * y := by assumption
  -- Use the property of square roots to square both sides.
