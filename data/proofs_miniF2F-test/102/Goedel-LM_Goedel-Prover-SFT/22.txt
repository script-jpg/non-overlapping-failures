  To solve the equation \(\sqrt{19 + 3y} = 7\), we start by squaring both sides to eliminate the square root. This gives us \(19 + 3y = 49\). Next, we isolate \(y\) by subtracting 19 from both sides, resulting in \(3y = 30\). Finally, we solve for \(y\) by dividing both sides by 3, yielding \(y = 10\).

  have h₀ : 0 ≤ 19 + 3 * y := by
    apply h₀
  -- Simplify the equation by squaring both sides.
