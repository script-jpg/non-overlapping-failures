  To solve for \( y \) in the equation \(\sqrt{19 + 3y} = 7\), we start by squaring both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root. This gives us \(19 + 3y = 49\). Next, we isolate \( y \) by subtracting 19 from both sides, resulting in \(3y = 30\). Finally, we divide both sides by 3 to obtain \( y = 10 \).

    -- We use the fact that the square root of a number is non-negative to square both sides.
    have : 0 ≤ 19 + 3 * y := by linarith
    -- We square both sides of the equation to get 19 + 3y = 49.
