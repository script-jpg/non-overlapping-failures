  Given the equation \(\sqrt{19 + 3y} = 7\), we need to find the value of \(y\). First, we square both sides to eliminate the square root, yielding \(19 + 3y = 49\). Next, we isolate \(y\) by subtracting 19 from both sides, resulting in \(3y = 30\). Finally, we solve for \(y\) by dividing both sides by 3, obtaining \(y = 10\).

  -- Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root.
  have h₁' : 0 ≤ 19 + 3 * y := by assumption
  have h₁'' : (Real.sqrt (19 + 3 * y)) ^ 2 = 7 ^ 2 := by rw [h₁]
  rw [Real.sq_sqrt (by assumption : 0 ≤ 19 + 3 * y)] at h₁''
  -- Simplify the equation to isolate y.
