  · -- Squaring both sides, we get $19 + 3y = 49$.
    have : 19 + 3 * y = 49 := by linarith
    -- Solving for $y$, we get $3y = 30$.
    have : 3 * y = 30 := by linarith
    -- Dividing by 3, we get $y = 10$.

  -- We need to show $19 + 3y \geq 0$.
  have : 19 + 3 * y ≥ 0 := by linarith
  -- And $7 \geq 0$.
  have : 7 ≥ 0 := by linarith
  -- The latter is needed for the square root to be well-defined.
