# Solving the Equation $\sqrt{19+3y} = 7$ in Lean 4

To solve the equation $\sqrt{19+3y} = 7$ for $y$, we'll first square both sides to eliminate the square root. 

Starting with the given equation:
$\sqrt{19+3y} = 7$

Squaring both sides:
$19+3y = 7^2$

$19+3y = 49$

Subtracting 19 from both sides:
$3y = 30$

Dividing by 3:
$y = 10$

Now let's translate this into Lean 4:

```tactics

First, we need to import the necessary libraries and set up the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_263 (y : ℝ) (h₀ : 0 ≤ 19 + 3 * y) (h₁ : Real.sqrt (19 + 3 * y) = 7) :
    y = 10 := by
```

We have the theorem statement with:
- $y$ is a real number
- $19 + 3y \geq 0$ (ensuring the square root is defined)
- $\sqrt{19+3y} = 7$
- We need to prove $y = 10$

To solve $\sqrt{19+3y} = 7$, we square both sides:
$19+3y = 7^2 = 49$

From $19+3y = 49$:
$3y = 30$
$y = 10$

In Lean, we can proceed as follows:

```tactics
have h2 : 19 + 3 * y = 49 := by
  calc
    19 + 3 * y = (Real.sqrt (19 + 3 * y)) ^ 2 := by rw [Real.sq_sqrt]; linarith
    _ = 7 ^ 2 := by rw [h₁]
    _ = 49 := by norm_num
```

Now we have $19 + 3y = 49$. We can solve for $y$ by rearranging:
$3y = 49 - 19 = 30$
$y = 30 / 3 = 10$

In Lean, we can conclude:

```tactics
linarith
```

The Lean proof is complete! We've shown that from the equation $\sqrt{19+3y} = 7$ and the non-negativity of $19+3y$, it follows that $y = 10$.
