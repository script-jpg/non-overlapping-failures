This proof involves finding the value of $y$ that satisfies the equation $\sqrt{19+3y} = 7$. Let's think about how to solve this algebraically first, and then translate it into Lean 4.

First, we start with the equation $\sqrt{19+3y} = 7$. To eliminate the square root, we can square both sides:

$(\sqrt{19+3y})^2 = 7^2$

This simplifies to:

$19+3y = 49$

Next, we solve for $y$:

$3y = 49 - 19$

$3y = 30$

$y = \frac{30}{3}$

$y = 10$

Now, let's translate this into Lean 4:

We've imported the necessary libraries and opened the relevant namespaces. Now let's define the theorem:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_263 (y : ℝ) (h₀ : 0 ≤ 19 + 3 * y) (h₁ : Real.sqrt (19 + 3 * y) = 7) :
    y = 10 := by
```

We have a real number $y$ where $19+3y \geq 0$ (ensuring the square root is defined) and $\sqrt{19+3y} = 7$. We need to prove $y = 10$.

To solve this, we'll square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root:

```tactics
rw [Real.sqrt_eq_iff_eq_sq] at h₁
```

After applying `Real.sqrt_eq_iff_eq_sq`, the hypothesis `h₁` should be transformed into: $19 + 3y = 7^2$ with the implicit non-negativity condition (which we already have as `h₀`).

Now we need to simplify $7^2$ to get $49$:

```tactics
nlinarith
```

The `nlinarith` tactic is powerful enough to solve arithmetic goals involving non-linear constraints. It will automatically use the hypothesis that $19 + 3y = 49$ (from the squared equation) and derive that $y = 10$.

In summary, our Lean proof is remarkably concise:
1. We rewrote the square root equality as an explicit squared equation
2. We used Lean's arithmetic solver to handle the algebraic manipulation

This demonstrates how Lean's automation can efficiently solve straightforward algebraic problems that would typically require multiple steps in a manual proof.
