This completes the proof. The Lean proof demonstrates that if $y$ is a real number such that $\sqrt{19+3y} = 7$ and $19+3y \geq 0$, then $y = 10$. The proof strategy involves:
1. Recognizing that if $\sqrt{z} = 7$ and $z \geq 0$, then $z = 7^2$
2. Applying this to our specific case where $z = 19+3y$
3. Solving the resulting equation $19+3y = 49$ to get $y = 10$
4. Using Lean's arithmetic capabilities to formalize these steps
</- Find $y$: $\sqrt{19+3y} = 7$. Show that it is 10.-/
