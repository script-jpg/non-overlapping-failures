This theorem states that if $y$ is a real number satisfying $\sqrt{19+3y} = 7$ (with the condition that $19+3y \geq 0$), then $y = 10$.

Let's analyze the proof:

1. The proof begins by noting that we have $\sqrt{19+3y} = 7$ and $19+3y \geq 0$.
2. The key insight is that if $\sqrt{x} = a$ for $a \geq 0$, then $x = a^2$. So, from $\sqrt{19+3y} = 7$, we can derive $19+3y = 7^2$.
3. This is formalized by the line `have h₂ : 19 + 3 * y = 7 ^ 2 := by`.
4. The proof of this equality uses the fact that $\sqrt{19+3y} = 7 \implies 19+3y = 7^2$ by the definition of the square root function. This is done with `rw[← h₁]` (rewriting using the reverse of h₁) followed by `Real.sq_sqrt h₀` (apply the lemma that $(\sqrt{x})^2 = x$ when $x \geq 0$).
5. Now we have $19 + 3y = 7^2 = 49$.
6. The next step is to solve for $y$: $19 + 3y = 49 \implies 3y = 49 - 19 = 30 \implies y = 10$.
7. This linear arithmetic is handled by Lean's `linarith` tactic, which can solve linear equalities and inequalities.

Therefore, the unique solution to the equation $\sqrt{19+3y} = 7$ is $y = 10$.
