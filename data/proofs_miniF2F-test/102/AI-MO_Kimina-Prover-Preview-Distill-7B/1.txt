This theorem states that if $y$ is a real number satisfying $\sqrt{19+3y} = 7$ (with the assumption that $19+3y \geq 0$), then $y = 10$. Let's solve this step by step:

1. Start with the equation $\sqrt{19+3y} = 7$.
2. To eliminate the square root, we square both sides: $(\sqrt{19+3y})^2 = 7^2$.
3. The left side simplifies to $19+3y$ because $(\sqrt{x})^2 = x$ for $x \geq 0$.
4. The right side is $7^2 = 49$.
5. So we get $19 + 3y = 49$.
6. Subtract 19 from both sides: $3y = 30$.
7. Divide by 3: $y = 10$.

The Lean proof follows these steps. It first establishes that $19 + 3y = 7^2$ by squaring both sides of the equation $\sqrt{19+3y} = 7$. Then it normalizes the numerical expression $7^2$ to $49$, and finally uses linear arithmetic to solve $19 + 3y = 49$ and get $y = 10$.
