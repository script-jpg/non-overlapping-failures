This theorem solves the equation $\sqrt{19+3y} = 7$ for $y$. The approach is to square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root, which gives us $19+3y = 49$. Then, by rearranging, we find that $3y = 30$, and thus $y = 10$.

The theorem statement includes a non-negativity condition `h₀ : 0 ≤ 19 + 3 * y` to ensure that the expression under the square root is non-negative, as square roots of negative numbers are not defined in the real numbers.

The proof starts by using the property that for any non-negative real number $x$, we have $(\sqrt{x})^2 = x$. This is encapsulated in the lemma `Real.sq_sqrt` from Mathlib. This allows us to deduce that $19 + 3y = 49$ from the given equation $\sqrt{19+3y} = 7$.

Then, the proof uses basic algebraic manipulation to solve for $y$, subtracting 19 from both sides to get $3y = 30$, and then dividing by 3 to get $y = 10$.

The answer is indeed $\boxed{10}$.
