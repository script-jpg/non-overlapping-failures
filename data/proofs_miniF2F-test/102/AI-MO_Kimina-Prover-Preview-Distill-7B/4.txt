In this Lean 4 proof, we're tasked with finding the value of $y$ given the equation $\sqrt{19+3y} = 7$.

First, we need to eliminate the square root by squaring both sides of the equation. This is a standard step when solving equations involving square roots. In Lean, we'll need to use properties of the square root function and real numbers.

Let's start by setting up our proof structure:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

We've imported the appropriate libraries and opened namespaces for working with real numbers, square roots, etc. The `maxHeartbeats 0` option allows for more exhaustive proof search.

Now let's define the theorem statement. We have a real number $y$ satisfying $\sqrt{19+3y} = 7$, and we need to prove $y = 10$:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_263 (y : ℝ) (h₀ : 0 ≤ 19 + 3 * y) (h₁ : Real.sqrt (19 + 3 * y) = 7) :
    y = 10 := by
```

We have our theorem statement with:
- `y` is a real number
- `h₀` ensures the expression under the square root is non-negative (required for real square roots)
- `h₁` is the given equation $\sqrt{19+3y} = 7$

Let's solve this step by step. From $\sqrt{19+3y} = 7$, squaring both sides gives $19+3y = 49$.

In Lean, we'll need to use the property that $(\sqrt{x})^2 = x$ when $x \geq 0$:

```tactics
have h₃   : 19 + 3 * y = 49 := by
  calc
    19 + 3 * y = (Real.sqrt (19 + 3 * y)) ^ 2 := by rw [Real.sq_sqrt h₀]
    _ = 7 ^ 2 := by rw [h₁]
    _ = 49 := by norm_num
```

We've established that $19 + 3y = 49$. Now we need to solve for $y$ using linear arithmetic:

```tactics
linarith
```

The `linarith` tactic is powerful enough to solve linear arithmetic goals. From $19 + 3y = 49$, it can derive:
- $3y = 49 - 19 = 30$
- $y = 30 / 3 = 10$

Therefore, $y = 10$.

In summary, our complete proof shows that the only value of $y$ satisfying $\sqrt{19+3y} = 7$ is $y = 10$.
