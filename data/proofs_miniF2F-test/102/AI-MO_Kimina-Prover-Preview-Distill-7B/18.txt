      19 + 3 * y = (Real.sqrt (19 + 3 * y)) ^ 2 := by rw [Real.sq_sqrt]; linarith

      _ = 49 := by norm_num

  -- Now we have a linear equation $19 + 3y = 49$.

The key insight in this problem is that to solve for $y$ in $\sqrt{19+3y} = 7$, we need to square both sides to get $19+3y = 49$, and then solve the linear equation. The Lean proof mirrors the informal steps by first ensuring the expression under the square root is non-negative (which is given), then squaring both sides of the equation, and finally solving the resulting linear equation.
