-- We begin by thinking about how to solve the equation $\sqrt{19+3y} = 7$ for $y$.

  -- First, we need to eliminate the square root by squaring both sides of the equation.

    -- We must be careful with the conditions for square root equality.
    -- The expression under the square root must be non-negative (which we're given as $h₀$),
    -- and the square root function returns non-negative values.
    -- So we need to ensure that $7 \geq 0$, which is true.

  -- Now we have the equation $19 + 3y = 49$.
  -- We can solve for $y$ by isolating it: $3y = 49 - 19 = 30$.
  -- Therefore, $y = 10$.
