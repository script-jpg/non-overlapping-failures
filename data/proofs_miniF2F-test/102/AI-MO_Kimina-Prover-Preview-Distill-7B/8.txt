This proof demonstrates how to solve for $y$ in the equation $\sqrt{19+3y} = 7$. The key steps are:
1. Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root, yielding $19+3y = 49$.
2. Solving for $y$ from $19+3y = 49$:
   - Subtracting 19 from both sides: $3y = 30$.
   - Dividing by 3: $y = 10$.

The Lean proof uses `Real.sqrt_eq_iff_eq_sq` to transform $\sqrt{19+3y} = 7$ into $19+3y = 7^2$ while maintaining the non-negativity condition. Then it uses linear arithmetic to solve the resulting equation $19 + 3 * y = 49$ to find $y = 10$.
