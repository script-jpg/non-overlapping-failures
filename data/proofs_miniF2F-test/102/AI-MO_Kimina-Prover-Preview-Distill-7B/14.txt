In this proof, we start with the equation $\sqrt{19+3y} = 7$. To solve for $y$, we first square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root. This gives us $19+3y = 7^2$. 

Calculating $7^2$ gives $19+3y = 49$. 

Subtracting 19 from both sides, we get $3y = 30$. 

Dividing both sides by 3, we find $y = 10$. 

The Lean proof uses `Real.sqrt_eq_iff_eq_sq` to handle the squaring of both sides of the equation. The `nlinarith` tactic is then able to solve the resulting non-linear arithmetic goal. 

The hypothesis `h₀ : 0 ≤ 19 + 3 * y` ensures that the expression under the square root is non-negative, which is a necessary condition for the square root to be defined in the real numbers. 

Therefore, the complete proof shows that if $\sqrt{19+3y} = 7$ and $19+3y \geq 0$, then $y = 10$.
