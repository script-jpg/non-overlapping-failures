-- We begin by squaring both sides of the equation $\sqrt{19+3y} = 7$ to eliminate the square root.
  have h2 : Real.sqrt (19 + 3 * y) ^ 2 = 7 ^ 2 := by rw [h₁]
  -- According to the definition of square root, we have $19+3y = 7^2$.

  -- Then we simplify the equation to get $19 + 3y = 49$.

  -- Substituting $19$ to both sides, we have $3y = 30$.
