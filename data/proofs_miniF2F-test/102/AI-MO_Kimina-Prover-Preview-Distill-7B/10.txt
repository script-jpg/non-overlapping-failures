-- We begin by noting that in order to solve $\sqrt{19+3y} = 7$, we first need to ensure that the
  -- expression under the square root is non-negative (since square roots of negative numbers aren't
  -- defined in the reals). So we have the constraint $19 + 3y \geq 0$.
  have h_neg : 0 ≤ 19 + 3 * y := h₀

  -- To solve $\sqrt{19+3y} = 7$, we square both sides to get $19+3y = 7^2$.
  have h_eq : 19 + 3 * y = 7 ^ 2 := by
    calc
      19 + 3 * y = (Real.sqrt (19 + 3 * y)) ^ 2 := by
        rw [Real.sq_sqrt]
        exact h_neg
      _ = 7 ^ 2 := by rw [h₁]

  -- Then we evaluate $7^2 = 49$ and solve for $y$ to get $3y = 49 - 19 = 30$.
  have h_eq' : 3 * y = 30 := by linarith

  -- Dividing both sides by 3, we get $y = 10$.
