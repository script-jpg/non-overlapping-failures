  Given an odd integer \( a \) and a natural number \( b \) such that \( 4 \mid b \), we need to show that \( a^2 + b^2 \equiv 1 \mod 8 \).
  1. Since \( a \) is odd, \( a \mod 8 \) can be one of the following residues: 1, 3, 5, or 7.
  2. Since \( 4 \mid b \), \( b \mod 8 \) can be one of the following residues: 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.
  3. We consider all combinations of \( a \mod 8 \) and \( b \mod 8 \) and compute \( a^2 + b^2 \mod 8 \).
  4. By examining all cases, we find that \( a^2 + b^2 \mod 8 \) is always 1.
