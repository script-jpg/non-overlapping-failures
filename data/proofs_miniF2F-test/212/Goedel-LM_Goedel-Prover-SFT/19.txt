  Given an odd integer \( a \) and a natural number \( b \) such that \( 4 \mid b \), we need to show that \( a^2 + b^2 \equiv 1 \mod 8 \).
  1. Express \( a \) as \( 2k + 1 \) for some integer \( k \) because \( a \) is odd.
  2. Express \( b \) as \( 4m \) for some integer \( m \) because \( 4 \mid b \).
  3. Substitute \( a = 2k + 1 \) and \( b = 4m \) into \( a^2 + b^2 \).
  4. Simplify the expression modulo 8.
  5. Use the fact that \( (2k + 1)^2 \equiv 1 \mod 8 \) and \( (4m)^2 \equiv 0 \mod 8 \).
  6. Combine these results to show \( a^2 + b^2 \equiv 1 \mod 8 \).
