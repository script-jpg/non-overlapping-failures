  Given an odd integer \( a \) and a natural number \( b \) such that \( 4 \mid b \), we need to show that \( a^2 + b^2 \equiv 1 \mod 8 \).
  1. Since \( a \) is odd, we can express \( a \) as \( 2k + 1 \) for some integer \( k \).
  2. Since \( 4 \mid b \), we can express \( b \) as \( 4m \) for some integer \( m \).
  3. We need to compute \( a^2 + b^2 \mod 8 \).
  4. Substituting \( a \) and \( b \) into the expression, we get:
     \[
     a^2 + b^2 = (2k + 1)^2 + (4m)^2
     \]
  5. Expanding the squares:
     \[
     (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1
     \]
     \[
     (4m)^2 = 16m^2
     \]
  6. Adding these together:
     \[
     a^2 + b^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 + 16m^2
     \]
  7. Simplifying modulo 8:
     \[
     4k^2 + 4k + 1 + 16m^2 \equiv 1 \mod 8
     \]
  8. Therefore, \( a^2 + b^2 \equiv 1 \mod 8 \).
