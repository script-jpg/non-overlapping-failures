  Given an odd integer \( a \) and a natural number \( b \) such that \( 4 \mid b \), we need to show that \( a^2 + b^2 \equiv 1 \mod 8 \).
  1. Since \( a \) is odd, we can express \( a \) as \( 2k + 1 \) for some integer \( k \).
  2. Given \( 4 \mid b \), we know \( b \) is a multiple of 4.
  3. We need to compute \( a^2 + b^2 \mod 8 \).
  4. Substitute \( a = 2k + 1 \) and \( b = 4m \) for some integer \( m \).
  5. Calculate \( a^2 + b^2 \):
     \[
     a^2 = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1
     \]
     \[
     b^2 = (4m)^2 = 16m^2
     \]
     \[
     a^2 + b^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 + 16m^2
     \]
  6. Since \( 4k^2 + 4k \) is always even, it is congruent to 0 modulo 8.
  7. Therefore, \( a^2 + b^2 \equiv 1 \mod 8 \).
