  Given an odd integer \( a \) and a natural number \( b \) such that \( 4 \mid b \), we need to show that \( a^2 + b^2 \equiv 1 \mod 8 \).
  1. Since \( a \) is odd, we can express \( a \) as \( 2k + 1 \) for some integer \( k \).
  2. Since \( 4 \mid b \), \( b \) can be written as \( 4m \) for some integer \( m \).
  3. We need to compute \( a^2 + b^2 \mod 8 \).
  4. Substitute \( a = 2k + 1 \) and \( b = 4m \) into \( a^2 + b^2 \):
     \[
     a^2 = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1
     \]
     \[
     b^2 = (4m)^2 = 16m^2
     \]
     \[
     a^2 + b^2 = (4k^2 + 4k + 1) + 16m^2
     \]
  5. Since \( 4k^2 + 4k \) is always even, it is congruent to 0 modulo 8:
     \[
     4k^2 + 4k \equiv 0 \mod 8
     \]
  6. Therefore, we have:
     \[
     a^2 + b^2 \equiv 1 + 16m^2 \mod 8
     \]
  7. Since \( 16m^2 \equiv 0 \mod 8 \), we get:
     \[
     a^2 + b^2 \equiv 1 \mod 8
     \]
