  Given an odd integer \( a \) and a natural number \( b \) such that \( 4 \mid b \), we need to show that \( a^2 + b^2 \equiv 1 \mod 8 \).
  1. Since \( a \) is odd, we can write \( a = 2k + 1 \) for some integer \( k \).
  2. Since \( 4 \mid b \), \( b \) can be written \( b = 4m \) for some integer \( m \).
  3. Substitute \( a = 2k + 1 \) and \( b = 4m \) into \( a^2 + b^2 \):
     \[
     a^2 = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1
     \]
     \[
     b^2 = (4m)^2 = 16m^2
     \]
     \[
     a^2 + b^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 + 16m^2
     \]
  4. Simplify the expression modulo 8:
     \[
     4k^2 + 4k + 1 + 16m^2 \equiv 1 \mod 8
     \]
     This is because \( 4k^2 \equiv 0 \mod 8 \) and \( 4k \equiv 0 \mod 8 \), and \( 16m^2 \equiv 0 \mod 8 \).
  5. Therefore, \( a^2 + b^2 \equiv 1 \mod 8 \).
