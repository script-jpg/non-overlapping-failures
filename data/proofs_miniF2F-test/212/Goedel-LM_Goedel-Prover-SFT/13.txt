  Given an odd integer \( a \) and a natural number \( b \) such that \( 4 \mid b \), we need to show that \( a^2 + b^2 \equiv 1 \mod 8 \).
  1. Since \( a \) is odd, we can express \( a \) as \( 2k + 1 \) for some integer \( k \).
  2. Given \( 4 \mid b \), we know that \( b \) is a multiple of 4, so \( b \equiv 0 \mod 4 \).
  3. We need to compute \( a^2 + b^2 \mod 8 \).
  4. First, compute \( a^2 \mod 8 \):
     - Since \( a \) is odd, \( a^2 \equiv 1 \mod 8 \).
  5. Next, compute \( b^2 \mod 8 \):
     - Since \( b \) is a multiple of 4, \( b^2 \equiv 0 \mod 8 \).
  6. Adding these results, we get \( a^2 + b^2 \equiv 1 + 0 \equiv 1 \mod 8 \).
  Thus, \( a^2 + b^2 \equiv 1 \mod 8 \).
