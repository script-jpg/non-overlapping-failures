  Given an odd integer \( a \) and a natural number \( b \) such that \( 4 \mid b \), we need to show that \( a^2 + b^2 \equiv 1 \mod 8 \).
  1. Since \( a \) is odd, we can express \( a \) as \( 2k + 1 \) for some integer \( k \).
  2. Express \( b \) as \( 4m \) for some integer \( m \) since \( 4 \mid b \).
  3. Substitute \( a = 2k + 1 \) and \( b = 4m \) into the expression \( a^2 + b^2 \).
  4. Calculate \( a^2 \) and \( b^2 \):
     \[
     a^2 = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1
     \]
     \[
     b^2 = (4m)^2 = 16m^2
     \]
  5. Add \( a^2 \) and \( b^2 \):
     \[
     a^2 + b^2 = (4k^2 + 4k + 1) + 16m^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 16m^2 + 1
     \]
  6. Since \( 4k^2 + 4k + 16m^2 \) is even, it cannot affect the remainder when divided by 8. Thus, we focus on \( 1 \mod 8 \).
  7. The remainder of \( 1 \mod 8 \) is 1.
  Therefore, \( a^2 + b^2 \equiv 1 \mod 8 \).
