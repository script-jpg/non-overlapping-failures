  Given the quadratic equation \(x^2 - mx + n = 0\) with two positive integer solutions \(k\) and \(t\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are both prime numbers and \(k > t\), we need to find the value of \(m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k\).
  First, we use the fact that \(k\) and \(t\) are solutions to the quadratic equation:
  \[ k^2 - mk + n = 0 \]
  \[ t^2 - mt + n = 0 \]
  We can express \(m\) and \(n\) in terms of \(k\) and \(t\):
  \[ m = \frac{k + t}{2} \]
  \[ n = \frac{k \cdot t}{2} \]
  Substituting these into the expression \(m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k\):
  \[ m^n = \left(\frac{k + t}{2}\right)^k \]
  \[ n^m = \left(\frac{k \cdot t}{2}\right)^t \]
  \[ k^t = k^t \]
  \[ t^k = t^k \]
  We need to simplify and find the value of the expression. Given the constraints and the fact that \(m\) and \(n\) are primes, we can use the fact that \(k\) and \(t\) are the roots of the quadratic equation to derive the value of the expression.
