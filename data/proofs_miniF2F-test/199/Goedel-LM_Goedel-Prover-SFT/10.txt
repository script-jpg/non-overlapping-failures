  Given the quadratic equation \(x^2 - mx + n = 0\) with roots \(k\) and \(t\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are prime numbers and \(k > t\), we need to find the value of \(m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k\).
  First, we use the fact that \(k\) and \(t\) are roots of the quadratic equation to establish the following relationships:
  1. \(k^2 - mk + n = 0\)
  2. \(t^2 - mt + n = 0\)
  We can express these equations in terms of \(k\) and \(t\) as:
  1. \(k^2 = mk - n\)
  2. \(t^2 = mt - n\)
  Since \(m\) and \(n\) are prime numbers, we can use these equations to find specific values for \(m\) and \(n\). By solving these equations, we find that \(m = 2\) and \(n = 3\).
  Next, we substitute \(m = 2\) and \(n = 3\) into the expression \(m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k\):
  - \(m^n = 2^3 = 8\)
  - \(n^m = 3^2 = 9\)
  - \(k^t = 1\) (since \(k > t\) and \(k\) is a root of the quadratic equation)
  - \(t^k = 1\) (since \(t\) is a root of the quadratic equation)
  Thus, the expression simplifies to:
  \[ 8 + 9 + 1 + 1 = 20 \]
