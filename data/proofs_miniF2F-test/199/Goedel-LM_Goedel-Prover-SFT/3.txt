  Given the quadratic equation \(x^2 - mx + n = 0\) with integer coefficients \(m\) and \(n\), we know that the positive integer solutions are \(k\) and \(t\). We are also given that \(m\) and \(n\) are both prime numbers and \(k > t\). We need to find the value of \(m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k\).
  From the given equations:
  \[ k^2 - mk + n = 0 \]
  \[ t^2 - mt + n = 0 \]
  We can express \(m\) and \(n\) in terms of \(k\) and \(t\):
  \[ m = k + t \]
  \[ n = k \cdot t \]
  Substituting these into the expression \(m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k\):
  \[ m^n = (k + t)^n \]
  \[ n^m = (k \cdot t)^m \]
  \[ k^t = k^t \]
  \[ t^k = t^k \]
  Given the constraints and the equations, we can simplify and solve for the value of the expression.
