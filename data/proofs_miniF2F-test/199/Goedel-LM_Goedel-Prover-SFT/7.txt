  Given the quadratic equation \(x^2 - mx + n = 0\) with positive integer solutions \(k\) and \(t\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are both prime numbers and \(k > t\), we need to find the value of \(m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k\) and show that it equals 20.
  1. Substitute \(k\) and \(t\) into the quadratic equation to get two equations:
     \[
     k^2 - mk + n = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad t^2 - mt + n = 0
     \]
  2. Since \(m\) and \(n\) are prime numbers, we can use the fact that the sum of the roots of the quadratic equation \(x^2 - mx + n = 0\) is \(m\) and the product of the roots is \(n\).
  3. Given \(k > t\), we can infer that \(k\) and \(t\) are the roots of the equation.
  4. We need to find the values of \(m\), \(n\), \(k\), and \(t\) that satisfy the given conditions and then compute the expression \(m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k\).
  5. By solving the quadratic equation and using the properties of prime numbers, we find that \(m = 2\), \(n = 3\), \(k = 6\), and \(t = 1\).
  6. Substituting these values into the expression, we get:
     \[
     2^3 + 3^2 + 6^1 + 1^6 = 8 + 9 + 6 + 1 = 24
     \]
  7. However, this result does not match the expected value of 20. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the conditions and the values of \(m\), \(n\), \(k\), and \(t\).
