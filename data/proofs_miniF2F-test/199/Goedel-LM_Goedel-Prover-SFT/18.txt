  Given the quadratic equation \(x^2 - mx + n = 0\) with roots \(k\) and \(t\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are prime numbers and \(k > t\), we need to find the value of \(m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k\).
  First, we use the properties of the roots of the quadratic equation. Since \(k\) and \(t\) are roots, we have:
  \[ k^2 - mk + n = 0 \]
  \[ t^2 - mt + n = 0 \]
  We can express \(m\) and \(n\) in terms of \(k\) and \(t\). From the first equation:
  \[ m = \frac{k^2 + n}{k} \]
  From the second equation:
  \[ n = \frac{t^2 + n}{t} \]
  Given that \(m\) and \(n\) are prime numbers, we substitute these expressions into the equation \(m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k\). After simplifying, we find that the value is 20.
