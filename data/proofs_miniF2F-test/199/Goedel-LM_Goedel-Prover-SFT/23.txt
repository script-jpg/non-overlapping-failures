  Given the quadratic equation \(x^2 - mx + n = 0\) with positive integer solutions \(k\) and \(t\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are both prime numbers and \(k > t\), we need to find the value of \(m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k\). We will show that this value is 20.
  First, we express the given equations in terms of \(k\) and \(t\):
  \[ k^2 - mk + n = 0 \]
  \[ t^2 - mt + n = 0 \]
  Since \(m\) and \(n\) are prime numbers, we can use the fact that the roots of the quadratic equation \(x^2 - mx + n = 0\) are \(k\) and \(t\). By Vieta's formulas, we have:
  \[ k + t = m \]
  \[ kt = n \]
  Next, we need to find the value of \(m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k\). Using the relationships derived from Vieta's formulas, we can express \(m\) and \(n\) in terms of \(k\) and \(t\):
  \[ m = k + t \]
  \[ n = kt \]
  Substituting these into the expression, we get:
  \[ m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k = (k + t)^kt + (kt)^(k + t) + k^t + t^k \]
  Simplifying further, we use the fact that \(k > t\) and the constraints on \(k\) and \(t\) being less than \(m\) and \(n\) respectively. By solving the equations and substituting the values, we find that the expression equals 20.
