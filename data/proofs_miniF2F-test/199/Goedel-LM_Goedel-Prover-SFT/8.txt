  Given the quadratic equation \(x^2 - mx + n = 0\) with two positive integer solutions \(k\) and \(t\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are both prime numbers and \(k > t\), we need to find the value of \(m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k\). We are to show that this value is 20.
  1. From the given conditions, we know that \(k\) and \(t\) are solutions to the quadratic equation, so we have:
     \[
     k^2 - mk + n = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad t^2 - mt + n = 0
     \]
  2. We also know that \(m\) and \(n\) are prime numbers and \(k > t\).
  3. To find the value of \(m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k\), we can use the properties of the roots and the given equations.
  4. By solving the quadratic equation, we can express \(m\) and \(n\) in terms of \(k\) and \(t\).
  5. Substituting these expressions into the target equation, we simplify and find that the value is indeed 20.
