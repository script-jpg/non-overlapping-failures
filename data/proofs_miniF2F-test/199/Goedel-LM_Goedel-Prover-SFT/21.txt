  Given the quadratic equation \(x^2 - mx + n = 0\) with positive integer solutions \(k\) and \(t\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are both prime numbers and \(k > t\), we need to find the value of \(m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k\).
  By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots \(k + t\) is equal to \(m\), and the product of the roots \(kt\) is equal to \(n\). Since \(m\) and \(n\) are both prime numbers, we can use the properties of prime numbers and the given inequalities to derive the value of the expression.
