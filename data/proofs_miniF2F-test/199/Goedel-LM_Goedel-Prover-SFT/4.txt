  Given the quadratic equation \(x^2 - mx + n = 0\) with positive integer solutions \(k\) and \(t\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are both prime numbers and \(k > t\), we need to find the value of \(m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k\). We are to show that this value is 20.
  1. From the given conditions, we know:
     - \(k\) and \(t\) are solutions to the quadratic equation:
       \[
       k^2 - mk + n = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad t^2 - mt + n = 0
       \]
     - \(m\) and \(n\) are prime numbers.
     - \(k > t\).
  2. Since \(k\) and \(t\) are solutions, we can use the fact that the sum of the roots of the quadratic equation \(x^2 - mx + n = 0\) is \(m\) and the product of the roots is \(n\).
  3. Given \(k > t\), we can infer that \(k\) and \(t\) are the roots of the equation. We need to find the values of \(m\), \(n\), \(k\), and \(t\) that satisfy these conditions.
  4. By solving the equations, we find that \(m = 5\), \(n = 3\), \(k = 6\), and \(t = 2\).
  5. Substituting these values into the expression \(m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k\), we get:
     \[
     5^3 + 3^5 + 6^2 + 2^6 = 125 + 243 + 36 + 64 = 458
     \]
  6. However, this result does not match the expected value of 20. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate our assumptions or calculations.
