  Given the quadratic equation \(x^2 - mx + n = 0\) with positive integer solutions \(k\) and \(t\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are both prime numbers and \(k > t\), we need to find the value of \(m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k\).
  First, we use the fact that \(k\) and \(t\) are solutions to the quadratic equation, so we have:
  \[ k^2 - mk + n = 0 \]
  \[ t^2 - mt + n = 0 \]
  This implies:
  \[ k^2 = mk - n \]
  \[ t^2 = mt - n \]
  Since \(m\) and \(n\) are prime numbers, we can use these equations to derive the values of \(m\), \(n\), \(k\), and \(t\). Given the constraints and the fact that \(k > t\), we can deduce that the only possible values are \(m = 5\), \(n = 2\), \(k = 3\), and \(t = 1\).
  Next, we substitute these values into the expression \(m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k\):
  \[ m^n = 5^2 = 25 \]
  \[ n^m = 2^5 = 32 \]
  \[ k^t = 3^1 = 3 \]
  \[ t^k = 1^3 = 1 \]
  Adding these together:
  \[ 25 + 32 + 3 + 1 = 61 \]
  However, this result does not match the expected value of 20. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate our assumptions or calculations. Given the constraints and the fact that \(k > t\), the only possible values for \(m\), \(n\), \(k\), and \(t\) are \(m = 5\), \(n = 2\), \(k = 3\), and \(t = 1\).

  have h₄ : m ≤ 6 := by
    -- Using the fact that m is a prime number and the equation k^2 - mk + n = 0, we derive that m must be less than or equal to 6.
    nlinarith [h₂, h₃]
  have h₅ : n ≤ 6 := by
    -- Similarly, using the fact that n is a prime number and the equation k^2 - mk + n = 0, we derive that n must be less than or equal to 6.

  interval_cases m <;> interval_cases n <;> interval_cases k <;> interval_cases t <;> simp_all (config := {decide := true})
  -- We use interval_cases to check all possible values of m, n, k, and t that satisfy the constraints and the fact that k > t. The only possible values are m = 5, n = 2, k = 3, and t = 1.
  -- Substituting these values into the expression m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k, we get:
  -- 5^2 + 2^5 + 3^1 + 1^3 = 25 + 32 + 3 + 1 = 61, which does not match the expected value of 20.
  -- Therefore, we need to re-evaluate our assumptions or calculations.
