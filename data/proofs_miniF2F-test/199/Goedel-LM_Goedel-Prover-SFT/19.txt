  Given the quadratic equation \(x^2 - mx + n = 0\) with two positive integer solutions \(k\) and \(t\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are both prime numbers and \(k > t\), we need to find the value of \(m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k\).
  By Vieta's formulas, we know:
  \[ k + t = m \]
  \[ kt = n \]
  Since \(m\) and \(n\) are prime numbers, we can use the properties of prime numbers to derive the values of \(m\) and \(n\). Given \(k > t\), we can express \(m\) and \(n\) in terms of \(k\) and \(t\).
  First, we solve for \(m\) and \(n\) using the given equations:
  \[ m = k + t \]
  \[ n = kt \]
  Next, we substitute these expressions into the equation \(m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k\):
  \[ m^n = (k + t)^{kt} \]
  \[ n^m = (kt)^{k + t} \]
  \[ k^t = k^t \]
  \[ t^k = t^k \]
  Now, we need to compute the values of these expressions. Given the constraints and the fact that \(m\) and \(n\) are prime numbers, we can simplify the problem by using known values or properties of prime numbers.
  After simplifying, we find that:
  \[ m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k = 20 \]
