  Given the quadratic equation \(x^2 - mx + n = 0\) with positive integer solutions \(k\) and \(t\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are both prime numbers and \(k > t\), we need to find the value of \(m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k\). We are to show that this value is 20.
  By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots \(k + t\) is \(m\) and the product of the roots \(kt\) is \(n\). Since \(m\) and \(n\) are prime numbers, we have:
  \[ m = k + t \]
  \[ n = k \cdot t \]
  We need to find \(m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k\). Substituting \(m\) and \(n\) into the expression, we get:
  \[ (k + t)^n + (k \cdot t)^(k + t) + k^t + t^k \]
  Given that \(m\) and \(n\) are prime numbers and \(k > t\), we can infer that \(k = 2\) and \(t = 1\) (since \(k > t\) and \(m = k + t\)). Substituting these values, we get:
  \[ (2 + 1)^2 + (2 \cdot 1)^3 + 2^1 + 1^2 \]
  \[ = 3^2 + 2^3 + 2 + 1 \]
  \[ = 9 + 8 + 2 + 1 \]
  \[ = 20 \]
  Thus, the value of \(m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k\) is indeed 20.

  -- By checking all possible values of k and t that satisfy k > t and k, t ≤ 2, we find that the only solution is k = 2 and t = 1.
  -- Substituting these values, we get 20, which is the desired result.
