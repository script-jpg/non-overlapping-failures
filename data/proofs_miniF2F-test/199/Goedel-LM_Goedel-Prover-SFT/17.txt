  Given the quadratic equation \(x^2 - mx + n = 0\) with positive integer solutions \(k\) and \(t\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are both prime numbers and \(k > t\), we need to find the value of \(m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k\). We are given that this value is 20.
  First, we use the properties of the roots of the quadratic equation:
  1. \(k + t = m\)
  2. \(kt = n\)
  Since \(m\) and \(n\) are prime numbers, we can list the possible pairs \((m, n)\) that satisfy the equation \(kt = n\) and \(k > t\). We then compute \(m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k\) for each pair and verify that the sum equals 20.
