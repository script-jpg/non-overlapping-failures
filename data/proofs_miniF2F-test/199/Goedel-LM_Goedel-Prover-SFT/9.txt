  Given the quadratic equation \(x^2 - mx + n = 0\) with two positive integer solutions \(k\) and \(t\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are both prime numbers and \(k > t\), we need to find the value of \(m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k\).
  By Vieta's formulas, we have:
  \[ k + t = m \]
  \[ kt = n \]
  Since \(m\) and \(n\) are prime numbers, we can list the possible pairs \((k, t)\) that satisfy \(k > t\) and \(k + t = m\), \(kt = n\).
  We then compute \(m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k\) for each pair and find that the only consistent solution is \(20\).
