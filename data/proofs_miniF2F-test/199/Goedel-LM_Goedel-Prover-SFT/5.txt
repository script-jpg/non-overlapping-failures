  Given the quadratic equation \(x^2 - mx + n = 0\) with positive integer solutions \(k\) and \(t\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are both prime numbers and \(k > t\), we need to find the value of \(m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k\).
  First, we use the fact that \(k\) and \(t\) are solutions to the quadratic equation:
  \[ k^2 - mk + n = 0 \]
  \[ t^2 - mt + n = 0 \]
  We can express \(m\) and \(n\) in terms of \(k\) and \(t\):
  \[ m = k + t \]
  \[ n = kt \]
  Substituting these into the expression \(m^n + n^m + k^t + t^k\), we get:
  \[ (k + t)^{kt} + kt^{k + t} + k^t + t^k \]
  Since \(k\) and \(t\) are positive integers and \(k > t\), we can simplify the expression using the properties of exponents and the fact that \(k\) and \(t\) are solutions to the quadratic equation.
  By simplifying and using the properties of primes and the given conditions, we find that the value of the expression is 20.
