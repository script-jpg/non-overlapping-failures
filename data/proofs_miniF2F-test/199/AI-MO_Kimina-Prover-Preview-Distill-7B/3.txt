  -- By the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality, $(k+t)^2 \geq 4kt$. Therefore, $m^2 \geq 4n$. This implies that $m^2 \geq 4n > n$, so $m > \sqrt{n}$. Since $m$ and $n$ are primes, we should have $m > n$. Note that if $m$ is a prime number and $m > 2$, then $m$ is odd. If $n$ is even, we have $m > n$. For $n$ odd, we have $m > \sqrt{n} \geq 3$. However, $n > 4$ and $n$ is prime, so $m > 4$, but $m < n$, which is impossible for $n \leq 5$. Therefore, there is no solution in this case.

  -- This leaves us with the case where $t = 1$, $k = p$, and $m = p + 1$, where $p$ is a prime number. Note that the prime number $p$ cannot be 2 or 3 because the smallest prime number greater than 2 or 3 is 5 and 7 respectively, but 5 is not greater than 2 or 7 is not greater than 3. Therefore, $p$ is at least 5, which means $m = p + 1$ is at least 6 and $n = p^2$ is at least 25. However, $m < n$ and $n$ is prime, so $n$ must be between $m^2$ and $m$, which is a contradiction. Hence, there is no solution in this case.
