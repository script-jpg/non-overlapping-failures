-- We can use `field_simp` to handle expressions with field operations.
  field_simp at *
  -- `field_simp` will clear denominators and turn fractions into multiplications
  -- It will also use the fact that $x ≠ 0$ to simplify expressions safely
  -- Now we need to expand the result and simplify
  ring_nf
  -- `ring_nf` will perform ring normalization to simplify the expression
  -- After simplification, we should get 10
