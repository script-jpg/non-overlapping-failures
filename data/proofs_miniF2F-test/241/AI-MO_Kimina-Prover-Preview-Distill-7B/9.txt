-- Simplify the expression step by step.

  -- First, rewrite each fraction as multiplication by reciprocal.
  rw [div_eq_mul_one_div, div_eq_mul_one_div, div_eq_mul_one_div]

  -- Then, simplify the multiplication of fractions.
  ring_nf

  -- Now, simplify the expression by cancelling common factors and using the fact that $x \ne 0$.
  field_simp [h₀]

  -- Finally, use the assumption that $x \ne 0$ to complete the proof.
