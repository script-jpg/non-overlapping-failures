  To simplify the expression \(\frac{12}{x \cdot x} \cdot \frac{x^4}{14x} \cdot \frac{35}{3x}\), we start by eliminating the fractions through multiplication. We then simplify the resulting expression by combining like terms and using algebraic identities. Finally, we verify that the simplified expression equals 10.
