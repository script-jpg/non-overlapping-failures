  To simplify the expression \(\frac{12}{x \cdot x} \cdot \frac{x^4}{14x} \cdot \frac{35}{3x}\) and show that it is 10, we proceed as follows:
  1. Simplify the fractions by canceling common terms.
  2. Use algebraic manipulation to combine and simplify the terms.
  3. Verify that the simplified expression equals 10.
