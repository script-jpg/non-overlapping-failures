  Given \( x \neq 0 \), we need to simplify the expression \(\frac{12}{x \cdot x} \cdot \frac{x^4}{14x} \cdot \frac{35}{3x}\) and show that it equals 10.
  1. Start by rewriting the expression using the properties of multiplication and division.
  2. Simplify the numerator and the denominator separately.
  3. Use algebraic identities to simplify the expression further.
  4. Verify that the simplified expression equals 10.
