  To prove that \(\frac{12}{x \cdot x} \cdot \frac{x^4}{14x} \cdot \frac{35}{3x} = 10\) for \(x \neq 0\), we proceed as follows:
  1. Simplify the expression by canceling out common factors in the numerator and the denominator.
  2. Apply the associative and commutative properties of multiplication to rearrange and combine terms.
  3. Use the fact that \(x \neq 0\) to ensure that no division by zero occurs.
  4. Verify that the simplified expression equals 10.
