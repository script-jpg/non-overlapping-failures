  To simplify the expression \(\frac{12}{x \cdot x} \cdot \frac{x^4}{14x} \cdot \frac{35}{3x}\) and show that it equals 10, we proceed as follows:
  1. Combine the fractions by multiplying the numerators and the denominators.
  2. Simplify the resulting expression by canceling out common terms.
  3. Verify that the simplified expression equals 10.
