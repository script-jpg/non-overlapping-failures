  To simplify the expression \(\frac{12}{x \cdot x} \cdot \frac{x^4}{14x} \cdot \frac{35}{3x}\), we start by eliminating the denominators using the assumption \(x \neq 0\). We then simplify the resulting expression step by step, using algebraic properties such as the associative and commutative properties of multiplication and the properties of exponents. Finally, we verify that the simplified expression equals 10.
