  Given \( x \neq 0 \), we need to simplify the expression \(\frac{12}{x \cdot x} \cdot \frac{x^4}{14x} \cdot \frac{35}{3x}\) and show that it equals 10.
  1. Start by simplifying the expression using algebraic identities and properties.
  2. Apply the commutative property of multiplication to rearrange the terms.
  3. Use the fact that \( x \neq 0 \) to cancel out common factors in the numerators and denominators.
  4. Simplify the resulting expression step by step to achieve the final simplified form.
