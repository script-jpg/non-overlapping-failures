  To simplify the expression \(\frac{12}{x \cdot x} \cdot \frac{x^4}{14x} \cdot \frac{35}{3x}\) and show that it equals 10, we proceed as follows:
  1. Simplify each fraction by canceling common terms in the numerator and the denominator.
  2. Combine the simplified fractions.
  3. Verify that the combined expression equals 10.
