  To prove that the expression \(\frac{12}{x \cdot x} \cdot \frac{x^4}{14x} \cdot \frac{35}{3x}\) simplifies to 10, we start by canceling out common factors in the numerator and the denominator. We use the fact that multiplication is commutative and associative, and we can group terms as needed.
  1. First, we rewrite the expression to group terms in a way that allows us to cancel out common factors.
  2. We then simplify the expression step by step, canceling out common factors and simplifying the remaining terms.
  3. Finally, we verify that the simplified expression equals 10.
