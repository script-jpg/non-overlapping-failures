  To simplify the expression \(\frac{12}{x \cdot x} \cdot \frac{x^4}{14x} \cdot \frac{35}{3x}\), we start by canceling out the common factors in the numerator and the denominator.
  1. Combine the fractions over a common denominator.
  2. Simplify the numerator by multiplying the numerators.
  3. Simplify the denominator by multiplying the denominators.
  4. Cancel out the common factors in the numerator and the denominator.
  5. Perform the remaining multiplications.
  6. Verify that the simplified expression equals 10.
