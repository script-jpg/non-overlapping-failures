  To simplify the expression \(\frac{12}{x \cdot x} \cdot \frac{x^4}{14x} \cdot \frac{35}{3x}\) and show that it equals 10, we proceed as follows:
  1. **Simplify the expression**:
     - Combine the fractions by multiplying the numerators and dividing the denominators.
     - Use algebraic identities to simplify the powers and products.
  2. **Verify the result**:
     - Ensure that the simplified expression equals 10.
