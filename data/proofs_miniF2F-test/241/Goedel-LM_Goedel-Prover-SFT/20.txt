x = -5

  Given x = -5, we need to simplify the expression 12 / (x * x) * (x^4 / (14 * x)) * (35 / (3 * x))
  and show that it equals 10.

  First, substitute x = -5 into the expression:

  12 / ((-5) * (-5)) * ((-5)^4 / (14 * (-5))) * (35 / (3 * (-5)))

  Simplify the powers and products:

  12 / (25) * (625 / (70)) * (35 / (-15))

  Combine the fractions step by step:

  12 * 625 * 35 / (25 * 70 * 15)

  Calculate the numerator and the denominator separately:

  12 * 625 * 35 = 252000

  25 * 70 * 15 = 26250

  Divide the numerator by the denominator:

  252000 / 26250 = 10

  Thus, the expression simplifies to 10.
