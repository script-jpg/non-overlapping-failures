  To simplify the expression \(\frac{12}{x \cdot x} \cdot \frac{x^4}{14x} \cdot \frac{35}{3x}\) and show that it equals 10, we proceed as follows:
  1. Simplify each fraction by canceling common terms in the numerator and the denominator.
  2. Combine the simplified fractions using the rules of multiplication and division.
  3. Verify that the resulting expression equals 10.
