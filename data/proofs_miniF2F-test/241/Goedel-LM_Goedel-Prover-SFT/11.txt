  To simplify the expression \(\frac{12}{x \cdot x} \cdot \frac{x^4}{14x} \cdot \frac{35}{3x}\) and show that it equals 10, we proceed as follows:
  1. Simplify the expression by canceling out common terms in the numerators and denominators.
  2. Use algebraic manipulations to combine and simplify the terms.
  3. Verify that the simplified expression equals 10.
