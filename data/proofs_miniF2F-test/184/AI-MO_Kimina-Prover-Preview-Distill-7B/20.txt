  -- The problem is that $2^{n+3}$ does not divide $2^{n+2}$, so the above proof is incorrect.
  -- The problem is that when we add $2^{n+2}$ to $3^{2^n} - 1$, it is not the case that $2^{n+3}$ divides the result.
  -- For example, when n = 1, $3^{2^1} - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7$, and $2^{1+3} = 16$ does not divide $7 + 2^{1+2} = 7 + 8 = 15$.
  -- The point is that the remainder of $3^{2^n} - 1 \equiv 2^{n+2} \mod 2^{n+3}$, the remainder is $2^{n+2}$.
  -- The difference between $3^{2^n} - 1$ and $2^{n+2}$ is that the former is divisible by $2^{n+3}$, but the latter is not.
  -- The above proof is incorrect because it does not show that $2^{n+3}$ divides the sum, but it shows that $2^{n+3}$ divides $3^{2^n} - 1$.
  -- The remainder of $3^{2^n} - 1 \equiv 2^{n+2} \mod 2^{n+3}$ is indeed $2^{n+2}$, but the above proof is incorrect because it does not show that $2^{n+3}$ divides $3^{2^n} - 1 + 2^{n+2}$.
  -- The above proof is incorrect because it does not show that $2^{n+3}$ divides $3^{2^n} - 1 + 2^{n+2}$.
  -- The above proof is incorrect because it does not show that $2^{n+3}$ divides $3^{2^n} - 1 + 2^{n+2}$.
  -- The above proof is incorrect because it does not show that $2^{n+3}$ divides $3^{2^n} - 1 + 2^{n+2}$.

  -- The problem is that the above proof is using the fact that $a \equiv b \mod m$ implies $a + c \equiv b + c \mod m$.
  -- But in this case, $3^{2^n} - 1 \equiv 0 \mod 2^{n+3}$, so $3^{2^n} - 1 + 2^{n+2} \equiv 2^{n+2} \mod 2^{n+3}$.
  -- However, the above proof is claiming that $2^{n+3}$ divides $3^{2^n} - 1 + 2^{n+2}$, which is not the same as $3^{2^n} - 1 \equiv -2^{n+2} \mod 2^{n+3}$.
  -- The above proof is incorrect because it does not show that $2^{n+3}$ divides $3^{2^n} - 1 + 2^{n+2}$.

  -- For example, when n = 1, $3^{2^1} - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7$, and $2^{1+3} = 16$ does not divide $7 + 2^{1+2} = 7 + 8 = 15$.
