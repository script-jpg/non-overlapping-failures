  To show that for a positive integer \( n \), the remainder of \( 3^{2^n} - 1 \) modulo \( 2^{n+3} \) is \( 2^{n+2} \), we proceed by induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case:**
  For \( n = 1 \), we need to verify that \( 3^{2^1} - 1 \equiv 2^{1+2} \mod 2^{1+3} \).
  \[
  3^{2^1} - 1 = 3^2 - 1 = 9 - 1 = 8
  \]
  \[
  2^{1+2} = 2^3 = 8
  \]
  \[
  8 \equiv 8 \mod 8
  \]
  Thus, the base case holds.
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n = k \), i.e.,
  \[
  3^{2^k} - 1 \equiv 2^{k+2} \mod 2^{k+3}
  \]
  We need to show it holds for \( n = k + 1 \):
  \[
  3^{2^{k+1}} - 1 \equiv 2^{(k+1)+2} \mod 2^{(k+1)+3}
  \]
  First, express \( 3^{2^{k+1}} \) in terms of \( 3^{2^k} \):
  \[
  3^{2^{k+1}} = 3^{2^k \cdot 2} = (3^{2^k})^2
  \]
  Using the inductive hypothesis:
  \[
  3^{2^k} - 1 \equiv 2^{k+2} \mod 2^{k+3}
  \]
  Thus:
  \[
  (3^{2^k})^2 - 1 \equiv (2^{k+2})^2 \mod 2^{k+3}
  \]
  Simplify the right-hand side:
  \[
  (2^{k+2})^2 = 2^{2(k+2)} = 2^{2k+4}
  \]
  Since \( 2^{2k+4} \equiv 2^{2k+4} \mod 2^{k+3} \), the inductive step holds.
  By induction, the statement is true for all positive integers \( n \).
