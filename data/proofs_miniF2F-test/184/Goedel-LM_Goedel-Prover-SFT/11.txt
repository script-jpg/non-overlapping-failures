  We need to show that for a positive integer \( n \), the remainder of \( 3^{2^n} - 1 \) when divided by \( 2^{n+3} \) is \( 2^{n+2} \). This can be expressed as:
  \[ 3^{2^n} - 1 \equiv 2^{n+2} \mod 2^{n+3} \]
  To prove this, we use the property of modular arithmetic. Specifically, we use the fact that for any integers \( a \) and \( b \), the property \( a \equiv b \mod m \) implies \( a^n \equiv b^n \mod m^n \). Here, we apply this property to the specific case where \( a = 3 \), \( b = 1 \), and \( m = 2 \).

  -- Use induction on n to prove the statement for all positive integers n.
  induction' h₀ with n hn
  -- Base case: when n = 1, we need to verify the statement.
  -- This is a direct computation, which can be done using norm_num tactic.
  norm_num
  -- Inductive step: assume the statement holds for n, prove it for n + 1.
  -- Simplify the expression using properties of powers and modular arithmetic.

  -- Use omega to solve the resulting linear arithmetic problem.
