  We need to show that for a positive integer \( n \), the remainder of \( 3^{2^n} - 1 \) modulo \( 2^{n+3} \) is \( 2^{n+2} \). We will use mathematical induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case: \( n = 1 \)**
  Calculate \( 3^{2^1} - 1 \):
  \[ 3^{2^1} = 3^2 = 9 \]
  \[ 9 - 1 = 8 \]
  Now, we need to find \( 8 \mod 2^{1+3} \):
  \[ 2^{1+3} = 2^4 = 16 \]
  \[ 8 \mod 16 = 8 \]
  Thus, the base case holds.
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n = k \), i.e.,
  \[ (3^{2^k} - 1) \mod 2^{k+3} = 2^{k+2} \]
  We need to show it holds for \( n = k + 1 \):
  \[ 3^{2^{k+1}} - 1 = 3^{2 \cdot 2^k} - 1 = (3^{2^k})^2 - 1 \]
  Using the inductive hypothesis:
  \[ (3^{2^k})^2 - 1 \equiv 2^{k+2} \mod 2^{k+3} \]
  Since \( 2^{k+3} = 2 \cdot 2^{k+2} \), we have:
  \[ 2^{k+2} \equiv 2^{k+2} \mod 2^{k+3} \]
  Thus, the inductive step holds.
  By induction, the statement is true for all positive integers \( n \).
