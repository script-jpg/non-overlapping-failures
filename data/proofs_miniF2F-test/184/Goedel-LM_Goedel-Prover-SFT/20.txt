  We need to show that for a positive integer \( n \), the remainder of \( 3^{2^n} - 1 \) when divided by \( 2^{n+3} \) is \( 2^{n+2} \). This can be achieved by induction on \( n \).
  1. **Base Case**: When \( n = 1 \), we need to verify that \( 3^{2^1} - 1 \equiv 2^{1+2} \mod 2^{1+3} \).
     - Calculate \( 3^{2^1} - 1 \):
       \[
       3^{2^1} = 3^2 = 9 \implies 9 - 1 = 8
       \]
     - Calculate \( 2^{1+2} \mod 2^{1+3} \):
       \[
       2^{1+2} = 2^3 = 8 \quad \text{and} \quad 2^{1+3} = 2^4 = 16
       \]
       Since \( 8 \equiv 8 \mod 16 \), the base case holds.
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds for some \( n \), i.e., \( 3^{2^n} - 1 \equiv 2^{n+2} \mod 2^{n+3} \). We need to show it holds for \( n+1 \).
     - Calculate \( 3^{2^{n+1}} - 1 \):
       \[
       3^{2^{n+1}} = 3^{2 \cdot 2^n} = (3^{2^n})^2
       \]
       By the inductive hypothesis, \( 3^{2^n} - 1 \equiv 2^{n+2} \mod 2^{n+3} \), so:
       \[
       (3^{2^n})^2 - 1 \equiv 2^{n+2} \cdot 2^{n+2} \equiv 2^{2n+4} \mod 2^{n+3}
       \]
     - Calculate \( 2^{(n+1)+2} \mod 2^{(n+1)+3} \):
       \[
       2^{(n+1)+2} = 2^{n+3} \quad \text{and} \quad 2^{(n+1)+3} = 2^{n+4}
       \]
       Since \( 2^{n+3} \equiv 2^{n+3} \mod 2^{n+4} \), the inductive step holds.
  By induction, the statement is true for all positive integers \( n \).
