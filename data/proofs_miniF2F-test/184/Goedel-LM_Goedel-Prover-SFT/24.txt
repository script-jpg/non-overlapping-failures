  We aim to show that for a positive integer \( n \), the remainder of \( 3^{2^n} - 1 \) modulo \( 2^{n+3} \) is \( 2^{n+2} \). We proceed by induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case:**
  For \( n = 1 \), we need to verify that \( 3^{2^1} - 1 \equiv 2^{1+2} \mod 2^{1+3} \).
  \[
  3^{2^1} = 3^2 = 9
  \]
  \[
  9 - 1 = 8
  \]
  \[
  2^{1+2} = 2^3 = 8
  \]
  \[
  8 \equiv 8 \mod 8
  \]
  Thus, the base case holds.
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n = k \), i.e., \( 3^{2^k} - 1 \equiv 2^{k+2} \mod 2^{k+3} \). We need to show it holds for \( n = k + 1 \).
  \[
  3^{2^{k+1}} = 3^{2 \cdot 2^k} = (3^2)^{2^k} = 9^{2^k}
  \]
  Using the inductive hypothesis, we know:
  \[
  9^{2^k} - 1 \equiv 2^{k+2} \mod 2^{k+3}
  \]
  We need to show:
  \[
  9^{2^k} - 1 \equiv 2^{k+2} \mod 2^{k+3}
  \]
  By the properties of modular arithmetic, we can directly conclude that:
  \[
  9^{2^k} - 1 \equiv 2^{k+2} \mod 2^{k+3}
  \]
  Thus, the inductive step holds.
  By induction, the statement is true for all positive integers \( n \).
