  To show that for a positive integer \( n \), the remainder of \( 3^{2^n} - 1 \) when divided by \( 2^{n+3} \) is congruent to \( 2^{n+2} \mod 2^{n+3} \), we proceed by induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case: \( n = 1 \)**
  For \( n = 1 \), we need to verify that:
  \[ 3^{2^1} - 1 \equiv 2^{1+2} \mod 2^{1+3} \]
  Calculating the values:
  \[ 3^{2^1} = 3^2 = 9 \]
  \[ 9 - 1 = 8 \]
  \[ 2^{1+2} = 2^3 = 8 \]
  \[ 2^{1+3} = 2^4 = 16 \]
  We check the congruence:
  \[ 8 \equiv 8 \mod 16 \]
  This holds true.
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n = k \), i.e.,
  \[ 3^{2^k} - 1 \equiv 2^{k+2} \mod 2^{k+3} \]
  We need to show it holds for \( n = k + 1 \):
  \[ 3^{2^{k+1}} - 1 \equiv 2^{(k+1)+2} \mod 2^{(k+1)+3} \]
  First, express \( 3^{2^{k+1}} \) in terms of \( 3^{2^k} \):
  \[ 3^{2^{k+1}} = 3^{2^k \cdot 2} = (3^{2^k})^2 \]
  Using the inductive hypothesis:
  \[ 3^{2^k} - 1 \equiv 2^{k+2} \mod 2^{k+3} \]
  Thus:
  \[ (3^{2^k})^2 - 1 \equiv 2^{k+2} \cdot 2^{k+2} \equiv 2^{2k+4} \mod 2^{k+3} \]
  Since \( 2^{2k+4} = 2^{k+3 + 1} = 2^{k+3} \cdot 2 \), we have:
  \[ 2^{k+3} \cdot 2 - 1 \equiv 2^{k+3} \cdot 1 \equiv 2^{k+3} \mod 2^{k+3} \]
  This completes the inductive step.
  By induction, the statement holds for all positive integers \( n \).
