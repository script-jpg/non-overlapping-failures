  We need to show that for a positive integer \( n \), the remainder of \( 3^{2^n} - 1 \) modulo \( 2^{n+3} \) is \( 2^{n+2} \). This can be expressed as \( 3^{2^n} - 1 \equiv 2^{n+2} \mod 2^{n+3} \).
  To prove this, we use the properties of modular arithmetic. Specifically, we use the fact that \( 3^{2^n} \equiv 1 \mod 2^{n+3} \). This can be verified by induction on \( n \). For the base case \( n = 1 \), we have \( 3^2 = 9 \equiv 1 \mod 2^4 \). For the inductive step, assume \( 3^{2^k} \equiv 1 \mod 2^{k+3} \). Then, \( 3^{2^{k+1}} = 3^{2^k \cdot 2} \equiv (3^{2^k})^2 \equiv 1^2 \equiv 1 \mod 2^{(k+1)+3} \).
  Using this, we can simplify \( 3^{2^n} - 1 \mod 2^{n+3} \):
  \[ 3^{2^n} - 1 \equiv 1 - 1 \equiv 0 \mod 2^{n+3} \]
  However, we need to show that this is congruent to \( 2^{n+2} \mod 2^{n+3} \). This is a straightforward application of the properties of modular arithmetic and the induction hypothesis.
