  We need to show that for a positive integer \( n \), the remainder of \( 3^{2^n} - 1 \) modulo \( 2^{n+3} \) is \( 2^{n+2} \). This can be achieved by demonstrating that \( 3^{2^n} \equiv 2^{n+1} \mod 2^{n+3} \).
  1. Start by expressing \( 3^{2^n} \) in terms of its modulo \( 2^{n+3} \) equivalent.
  2. Use properties of modular arithmetic to simplify the expression.
  3. Verify the congruence by checking the numerical values.
