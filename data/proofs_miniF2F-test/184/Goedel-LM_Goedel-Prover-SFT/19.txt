  We need to show that for a positive integer \( n \), the remainder of \( 3^{2^n} - 1 \) modulo \( 2^{n+3} \) is equal to \( 2^{n+2} \).
  1. Start by expressing \( 3^{2^n} - 1 \) in a form that allows us to apply modular arithmetic.
  2. Use the property of modular arithmetic to break down the expression \( 3^{2^n} - 1 \) into a sum of smaller terms.
  3. Simplify each term using known properties of powers and modular arithmetic.
  4. Combine the simplified terms to show that the remainder is \( 2^{n+2} \).
