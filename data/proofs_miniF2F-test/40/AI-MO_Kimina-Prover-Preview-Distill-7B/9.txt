-- The graphs of $y=x^4$ and $y=5x^2-6$ intersect at four points with $x$-coordinates $\pm \sqrt{m}$ and $\pm \sqrt{n}$, where $m > n$. What is $m-n$? Show that it is 1.

  -- We start by simplifying the equation $x^4 = 5x^2 - 6$ which gives us $x^4 - 5x^2 + 6 = 0$.

  -- By doing the same for $y$ and using the fact that $x^2 < y^2$, we get $y^2 = 3$ and $x^2 = 2$ so $y^2 - x^2 = 1$.
