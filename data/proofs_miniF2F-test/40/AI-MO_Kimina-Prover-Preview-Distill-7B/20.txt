-- The graphs of $y=x^4$ and $y=5x^2-6$ intersect at four points with $x$-coordinates $\pm \sqrt{m}$ and $\pm \sqrt{n}$, where $m > n$. What is $m-n$? Show that it is 1.

  -- We substitute the coordinates of the intersection points into the equations of the curves.

  have h₅ : x ^ 4 = 5 * x ^ 2 - 6 := by rw [h₀ x, h₁ x ] at h₂; exact h₂.symm
  have h₆ : y ^ 4 = 5 * y ^ 2 - 6 := by rw [h₀ y, h₁ y ] at h₃; exact h₃.symm

  -- We factorize the equations and solve for $x^2$ and $y^2$.

  have h₇ : (x ^ 2 - 3) * (x ^ 2 - 2) = 0 := by linarith
  have h₈ : (y ^ 2 - 3) * (y ^ 2 - 2) = 0 := by linarith

  -- We know that $y^2 < x^2$ since $x^2 < y^2$.

  have h₉ : y ^ 2 < x ^ 2 := by exact (sq_lt_sq₀ (by linarith) (by linarith)).mpr h₄

  -- So we can work out the result.

  have h₁₀ : x ^ 2 = 3 ∨ x ^ 2 = 2 := by aesop
  have h₁₁ : y ^ 2 = 3 ∨ y ^ 2 = 2 := by aesop
