-- The graphs of $y=x^4$ and $y=5x^2-6$ intersect at four points with $x$-coordinates $\pm \sqrt{m}$ and $\pm \sqrt{n}$, where $m > n$. What is $m-n$? Show that it is 1.

  -- We begin by setting up the structure of the problem. We have two functions $f(t) = t^4$ and $g(t) = 5t^2 - 6$, and we know that $f(x) = g(x)$ and $f(y) = g(y)$. This gives us the equations $x^4 = 5x^2 - 6$ and $y^4 = 5y^2 - 6$.

  have h₅ : x ^ 4 = 5 * x ^ 2 - 6 := by rw [←h₂, h₀, h₁]
  have h₆ : y ^ 4 = 5 * y ^ 2 - 6 := by rw [←h₃, h₀, h₁]

  -- Rearrange the equations to bring all terms to one side: $x^4 - 5x^2 + 6 = 0$ and $y^4 - 5y^2 + 6 = 0$. These are quadratic in form. Let's factor them.

  have h₇ : (x ^ 2 - 2) * (x ^ 2 - 3) = 0 := by linarith
  have h₈ : (y ^ 2 - 2) * (y ^ 2 - 3) = 0 := by linarith

  -- Solve the factored equations. So $x^2-2 = 0$ or $x^2 - 3 = 0$, which means $x^2 = 2$ or $x^2 = 3$. The solutions to $y^2-2=0$ are $y = \pm \sqrt{2}$, and the solutions to $y^2-3=0$ are $y = \pm \sqrt{3}$.

  have h₉ : x ^ 2 = 2 ∨ x ^ 2 = 3 := by
    cases (mul_eq_zero.mp h₇) with
    | inl h => left; linarith
    | inr h => right; linarith
  have h₁₀ : y ^ 2 = 2 ∨ y ^ 2 = 3 := by
    cases (mul_eq_zero.mp h₈) with
    | inl h => left; linarith
    | inr h => right; linarith

  -- In either case, we have $y^2 - x^2 = 1$. To see this, note that if $y^2 = 2$ and $x^2 = 3$, then $y^2 - x^2 = 2 - 3 = -1$. But since $y^2 > x^2$ (because $m > n$), we must have $y^2 = 3$ and $x^2 = 2$, so $y^2 - x^2 = 3 - 2 = 1$.

  cases h₉ with
  | inl hx2 => cases h₁₀ with
    | inl hy2 => linarith
    | inr hy2 => linarith
  | inr hx2 => cases h₁₀ with
    | inl hy2 => linarith
    | inr hy2 => linarith
