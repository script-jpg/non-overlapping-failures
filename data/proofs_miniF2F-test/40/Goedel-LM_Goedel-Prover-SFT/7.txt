  To solve the problem, we start by equating the given functions \( y = x^4 \) and \( y = 5x^2 - 6 \). This gives us the equation \( x^4 = 5x^2 - 6 \). We can rewrite this equation as \( x^4 - 5x^2 + 6 = 0 \). This is a quadratic equation in terms of \( x^2 \), which we can factorize as \( (x^2 + 3)(x^2 - 2) = 0 \). Thus, the solutions are \( x^2 = -3 \) or \( x^2 = 2 \). Since \( x^2 \) must be non-negative, we discard \( x^2 = -3 \) and keep \( x^2 = 2 \).
  Next, we need to find the corresponding \( y \) values. For \( x^2 = 2 \), we have \( y = x^4 = 2^2 = 4 \). For \( x^2 = -3 \), we have \( y = x^4 = (-3)^2 = 9 \).
  We are given that \( x^2 < y^2 \). Substituting the values, we get \( 2 < 4 \) and \( 2 < 9 \), which are true.
  Finally, we need to find \( m - n \). Given that \( y = x^4 \) and \( y = 5x^2 - 6 \), we can solve for \( m \) and \( n \) using the derived values. The correct values are \( m = 4 \) and \( n = 2 \), so \( m - n = 4 - 2 = 2 \).
