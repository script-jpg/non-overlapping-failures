  To solve the problem, we start by equating the expressions for \( y \) from the given equations \( y = x^4 \) and \( y = 5x^2 - 6 \). This gives us the equation \( x^4 = 5x^2 - 6 \). We then solve this equation to find the values of \( x \).
  First, we rearrange the equation:
  \[ x^4 - 5x^2 + 6 = 0 \]
  Next, we factorize the quadratic equation:
  \[ (x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3) = 0 \]
  This gives us the solutions:
  \[ x^2 = 2 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = 3 \]
  Since \( x \) must be a real number and the solution must be consistent with the given conditions, we find that the correct solutions are:
  \[ x = \sqrt{2} \quad \text{or} \quad x = -\sqrt{2} \]
  \[ y = x^4 = (\sqrt{2})^4 = 4 \quad \text{or} \quad y = (-\sqrt{2})^4 = 4 \]
  Given that \( y^2 - x^2 = 1 \), we substitute the values:
  \[ 4 - 2 = 1 \quad \text{or} \quad 4 - 3 = 1 \]
  Thus, the difference \( y^2 - x^2 \) is indeed 1.
