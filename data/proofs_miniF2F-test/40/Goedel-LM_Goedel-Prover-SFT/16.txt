  To solve the problem, we start by equating the two given functions:
  \[ x^4 = 5x^2 - 6 \]
  Next, we rearrange the equation to form a standard polynomial equation:
  \[ x^4 - 5x^2 + 6 = 0 \]
  We solve this polynomial equation by factoring. The equation can be rewritten as:
  \[ (x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3) = 0 \]
  This gives us two solutions:
  \[ x^2 = 2 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = 3 \]
  Since \( x^2 < y^2 \), we have \( y^2 = 3 \) and \( x^2 = 2 \). Therefore, the difference \( m - n \) is:
  \[ y^2 - x^2 = 3 - 2 = 1 \]
