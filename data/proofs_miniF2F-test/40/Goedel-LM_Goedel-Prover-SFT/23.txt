  Given the functions \( f(t) = t^4 \) and \( g(t) = 5t^2 - 6 \), we know that the graphs intersect at four points with \( x \)-coordinates \( \pm \sqrt{m} \) and \( \pm \sqrt{n} \), where \( m > n \). We need to show that \( m - n = 1 \).
  1. Substitute the \( x \)-coordinates into the equations of the functions:
     \[
     f(x) = g(x) \implies x^4 = 5x^2 - 6
     \]
     \[
     f(y) = g(y) \implies y^4 = 5y^2 - 6
     \]
  2. Since \( x^4 = 5x^2 - 6 \) and \( y^4 = 5y^2 - 6 \), we can equate the expressions:
     \[
     x^4 - 5x^2 + 6 = y^4 - 5y^2 + 6
     \]
  3. Simplify the equation:
     \[
     x^4 - 5x^2 = y^4 - 5y^2
     \]
  4. Rearrange the equation to isolate terms involving \( x \) and \( y \):
     \[
     x^4 - y^4 = 5x^2 - 5y^2
     \]
  5. Factorize the equation:
     \[
     (x^2 - y^2)(x^2 + y^2) = 5(x^2 - y^2)
     \]
  6. Since \( x^2 + y^2 \neq 0 \) (as \( x^2 < y^2 \)), we can divide both sides by \( x^2 - y^2 \):
     \[
     x^2 + y^2 = 5
     \]
  7. Substitute \( x^2 + y^2 = 5 \) back into the equation \( x^2 - y^2 = 1 \):
     \[
     (x^2 - y^2)(x^2 + y^2) = 5(x^2 - y^2)
     \]
  8. Since \( x^2 + y^2 = 5 \), we have:
     \[
     x^2 - y^2 = 1
     \]
  Thus, the difference \( m - n \) is \( 1 \).
