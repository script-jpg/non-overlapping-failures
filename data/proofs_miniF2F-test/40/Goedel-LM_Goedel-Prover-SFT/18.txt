  To solve the problem, we start by equating the given functions \( f(t) = t^4 \) and \( g(t) = 5t^2 - 6 \) at the points of intersection. This gives us the equation \( x^4 = 5x^2 - 6 \). We then solve this equation step by step.
  First, we rewrite the equation:
  \[ x^4 - 5x^2 + 6 = 0 \]
  Next, we factorize the left-hand side:
  \[ (x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3) = 0 \]
  This factorization implies that \( x^2 \) must be either 2 or 3. Therefore, the solutions for \( x \) are \( \pm \sqrt{2} \) and \( \pm \sqrt{3} \).
  Given the points of intersection are \( \pm \sqrt{m} \) and \( \pm \sqrt{n} \), we identify \( m = 2 \) and \( n = 3 \).
  Finally, we calculate \( m - n \):
  \[ m - n = 2 - 3 = -1 \]
  However, the problem states that \( m > n \), so we must have made an error in our identification. Rechecking the problem, we realize that the correct values should be \( m = 3 \) and \( n = 2 \), leading to:
  \[ m - n = 3 - 2 = 1 \]
  Thus, the correct answer is \( m - n = 1 \).
