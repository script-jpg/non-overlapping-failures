  To solve the problem, we start by equating the functions \( f(x) = x^4 \) and \( g(x) = 5x^2 - 6 \). Given that the graphs intersect at points where \( f(x) = g(x) \), we have:
  \[ x^4 = 5x^2 - 6 \]
  Next, we solve this equation by isolating \( x^2 \):
  \[ x^4 - 5x^2 + 6 = 0 \]
  We factorize the quadratic equation:
  \[ (x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3) = 0 \]
  This gives us the solutions:
  \[ x^2 = 2 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = 3 \]
  Since \( x^2 \) must be positive, we discard \( x^2 = -2 \) and \( x^2 = -3 \). Therefore, the valid solutions are:
  \[ x^2 = 2 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = 3 \]
  Given that \( x \) and \( y \) are roots of this equation, we have:
  \[ x^2 = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad y^2 = 3 \]
  Thus, the difference \( y^2 - x^2 \) is:
  \[ y^2 - x^2 = 3 - 2 = 1 \]
