  Given the functions \( f(t) = t^4 \) and \( g(t) = 5t^2 - 6 \), we know that the graphs of these functions intersect at four points with \( x \)-coordinates \(\pm \sqrt{m}\) and \(\pm \sqrt{n}\), where \( m > n \). We need to find the value of \( m - n \).
  First, we equate the expressions for \( f(t) \) and \( g(t) \):
  \[ t^4 = 5t^2 - 6 \]
  Next, we solve this equation for \( t^2 \):
  \[ t^4 - 5t^2 + 6 = 0 \]
  We factorize the quadratic equation:
  \[ (t^2 - 2)(t^2 - 3) = 0 \]
  Thus, the solutions are:
  \[ t^2 = 2 \quad \text{or} \quad t^2 = 3 \]
  Let \( m = 3 \) and \( n = 2 \). Therefore, the difference \( m - n \) is:
  \[ m - n = 3 - 2 = 1 \]
