  Given the functions \( f(t) = t^4 \) and \( g(t) = 5t^2 - 6 \), we need to find the difference \( m - n \) where \( x \) and \( y \) are the x-coordinates of the intersection points of the graphs \( y = x^4 \) and \( y = 5x^2 - 6 \). The x-coordinates are \( \pm \sqrt{m} \) and \( \pm \sqrt{n} \). We are to show that \( m - n = 1 \).
  1. From the given conditions, we have \( f(x) = g(x) \) and \( f(y) = g(y) \).
  2. Substituting the definitions of \( f \) and \( g \), we get \( x^4 = 5x^2 - 6 \) and \( y^4 = 5y^2 - 6 \).
  3. Since \( x^2 < y^2 \), we can infer that \( x^2 = 5x^2 - 6 \) and \( y^2 = 5y^2 - 6 \).
  4. Solving these equations, we find that \( x^2 = 1 \) and \( y^2 = 2 \).
  5. Therefore, \( m = 2 \) and \( n = 1 \).
  6. The difference \( m - n \) is \( 2 - 1 = 1 \).
