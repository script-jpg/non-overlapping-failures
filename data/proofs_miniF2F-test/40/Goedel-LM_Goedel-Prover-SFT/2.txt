  To solve the problem, we start by equating the given functions \( y = x^4 \) and \( y = 5x^2 - 6 \). This gives us the equation \( x^4 = 5x^2 - 6 \). Rearranging this equation, we find that \( x^4 - 5x^2 + 6 = 0 \). This is a quadratic equation in terms of \( x^2 \), which we can solve using the quadratic formula \( x^2 = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -5 \), and \( c = 6 \). Substituting these values, we get \( x^2 = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{25 - 24}}{2} = \frac{5 \pm 1}{2} \). This gives us two solutions: \( x^2 = 3 \) and \( x^2 = 2 \).
  Since \( x^2 < y^2 \), we choose \( x^2 = 2 \) and \( y^2 = 3 \). Therefore, \( y^2 - x^2 = 3 - 2 = 1 \).
