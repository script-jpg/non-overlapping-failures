  To solve the problem, we start by equating the given functions at the points of intersection:
  \[ x^4 = 5x^2 - 6 \]
  This can be rewritten as:
  \[ x^4 - 5x^2 + 6 = 0 \]
  We factorize this equation:
  \[ (x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3) = 0 \]
  Thus, the solutions for \( x^2 \) are:
  \[ x^2 = 2 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = 3 \]
  Given that \( x^2 < y^2 \), the possible pairs \((x^2, y^2)\) are:
  \[ (2, 3) \quad \text{or} \quad (3, 5) \]
  We need to find \( m - n \). Since \( y^2 - x^2 = 1 \), we can conclude:
  \[ m - n = 1 \]
