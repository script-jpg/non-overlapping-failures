  We need to show that the difference \( m - n \) is 1, where \( m \) and \( n \) are the x-coordinates of the intersection points of the graphs \( y = x^4 \) and \( y = 5x^2 - 6 \). Given that the x-coordinates are \( \pm \sqrt{m} \) and \( \pm \sqrt{n} \), and \( m > n \).
  First, we substitute the given functions \( f(t) = t^4 \) and \( g(t) = 5t^2 - 6 \) into the equation \( f(x) = g(x) \) and \( f(y) = g(y) \). This gives us the equations:
  \[ x^4 = 5x^2 - 6 \]
  \[ y^4 = 5y^2 - 6 \]
  Next, we use the fact that \( x^2 < y^2 \) to infer that the x-coordinates are less than the y-coordinates. We then apply algebraic manipulation and simplification to the equations to find the difference \( m - n \).
  By simplifying the equations and using basic algebraic inequalities, we derive that \( y^2 - x^2 = 1 \).
