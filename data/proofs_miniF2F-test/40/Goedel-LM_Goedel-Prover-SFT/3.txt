  Given the functions \( f(t) = t^4 \) and \( g(t) = 5t^2 - 6 \), we need to find the difference \( m - n \) where \( m \) and \( n \) are the x-coordinates of the intersection points of these functions, with \( x = \sqrt{m} \) and \( y = \sqrt{n} \). We are given that \( m > n \).
  The intersection points satisfy the equation \( t^4 = 5t^2 - 6 \). Let the roots of this equation be \( t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4 \) with \( t_1 = \sqrt{m} \) and \( t_2 = \sqrt{n} \). We know that \( t_1 \) and \( t_2 \) are the only roots, and since \( t_1 \) is greater than \( t_2 \), \( m \) is greater than \( n \).
  The difference \( m - n \) can be derived by considering the polynomial \( t^4 - 5t^2 + 6 = 0 \). The roots of this polynomial are \( t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4 \). According to Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is zero, and the product of the roots is \( \frac{6}{1} = 6 \).
  Since \( t_1 \) and \( t_2 \) are the only roots, we can use the fact that \( t_1 = \sqrt{m} \) and \( t_2 = \sqrt{n} \) to find \( m - n \). By solving the polynomial and using the fact that \( t_1 \) and \( t_2 \) are the roots, we find that \( m - n = 1 \).
