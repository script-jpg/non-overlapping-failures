  Given the functions \( f(t) = t^4 \) and \( g(t) = 5t^2 - 6 \), we know that the graphs of \( y = x^4 \) and \( y = 5x^2 - 6 \) intersect at points with \( x \)-coordinates \( \pm \sqrt{m} \) and \( \pm \sqrt{n} \), where \( m > n \). We need to show that \( m - n = 1 \).
  1. Substitute \( x \) and \( y \) into the equations \( f(t) = g(t) \):
     \[
     x^4 = 5x^2 - 6 \quad \text{and} \quad y^4 = 5y^2 - 6
     \]
  2. Since \( x^{1/2} \) and \( y^{1/2} \) are the \( x \)-coordinates of intersection points, we have:
     \[
     x = \sqrt{m} \quad \text{and} \quad y = \sqrt{n}
     \]
  3. The difference \( m - n \) can be derived from the equations:
     \[
     y^2 - x^2 = 1
     \]
