  Given the functions \( f(t) = t^4 \) and \( g(t) = 5t^2 - 6 \), we know that the graphs of \( y = x^4 \) and \( y = 5x^2 - 6 \) intersect at four points with \( x \)-coordinates \( \pm \sqrt{m} \) and \( \pm \sqrt{n} \), where \( m > n \). We need to show that \( m - n = 1 \).
  First, we substitute the expressions for \( f \) and \( g \) into the equation \( f(x) = g(x) \):
  \[ x^4 = 5x^2 - 6 \]
  Next, we solve for \( x^2 \):
  \[ x^4 - 5x^2 + 6 = 0 \]
  This is a quadratic equation in terms of \( x^2 \):
  \[ (x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3) = 0 \]
  Thus, the solutions are:
  \[ x^2 = 2 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = 3 \]
  Since \( x \) and \( y \) are real numbers and \( x^2 < y^2 \), we can assign \( x^2 = 2 \) and \( y^2 = 3 \). Therefore:
  \[ m = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad n = 2 \]
  Finally, we compute \( m - n \):
  \[ m - n = 3 - 2 = 1 \]
