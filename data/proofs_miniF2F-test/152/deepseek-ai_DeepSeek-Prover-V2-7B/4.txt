    -- We will use the fact that if m and n are both divisible by 8, then they can be written as 8k and 8l respectively
    -- We will then find the possible values of k and l such that gcd(k, l) = 1 and lcm(k, l) = 14
    -- The possible pairs (k, l) are (1, 14), (2, 7), (7, 2), and (14, 1)
    -- For each pair, we will compute m + n = 8(k + l) and find the minimum value
