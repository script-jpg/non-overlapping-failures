  Given positive integers \( m \) and \( n \), we know that their greatest common divisor (gcd) is 8 and their least common multiple (lcm) is 112. We need to find the least possible value of \( m + n \).
  First, we use the relationship between the gcd and lcm of two numbers:
  \[
  \text{gcd}(m, n) \times \text{lcm}(m, n) = m \times n
  \]
  Substituting the given values:
  \[
  8 \times 112 = m \times n
  \]
  Solving for \( m \times n \):
  \[
  m \times n = 896
  \]
  Next, we need to find the least possible value of \( m + n \). We use the fact that \( m \) and \( n \) are divisors of 896 and their sum is minimized when \( m \) and \( n \) are as small as possible while still being divisors of 896.
  By examining the divisors of 896, we find that the smallest pairs of divisors are:
  \[
  (1, 896), (2, 448), (4, 224), (8, 112), (16, 56), (32, 28), (64, 14), (128, 7)
  \]
  Among these pairs, the sum \( m + n \) is minimized with 72.
  Thus, the least possible value of \( m + n \) is 72.
