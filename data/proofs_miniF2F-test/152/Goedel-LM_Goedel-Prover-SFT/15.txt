  Given positive integers \( m \) and \( n \), we know that their greatest common divisor (gcd) is 8 and their least common multiple (lcm) is 112. We need to determine the least possible value of \( m + n \).
  1. We start by expressing the relationship between gcd and lcm:
     \[
     \text{gcd}(m, n) \times \text{lcm}(m, n) = m \times n
     \]
     Substituting the given values, we get:
     \[
     8 \times 112 = m \times n
     \]
     Simplifying, we find:
     \[
     896 = m \times n
     \]
  2. To find the least possible value of \( m + n \), we consider the possible pairs \((m, n)\) that satisfy the equation \( 896 = m \times n \). We list the pairs:
     \[
     (1, 896), (2, 448), (4, 224), (8, 112), (16, 56), (32, 28), (64, 14), (128, 7), (256, 4)
     \]
  3. We observe that the pairs \((8, 112)\) and \((16, 56)\) satisfy the condition \( 896 = m \times n \). The pairs with the smallest sums are \((8, 112)\) and \((16, 56)\).
  4. Calculating the sum of these pairs:
     \[
     8 + 112 = 120 \quad \text{and} \quad 16 + 56 = 72
     \]
  5. Since we are looking for the least possible value of \( m + n \), we choose the pair with the smallest sum:
     \[
     8 + 112 = 120 \quad \text{and} \quad 16 + 56 = 72
     \]
     Thus, the least possible value of \( m + n \) is 72.
