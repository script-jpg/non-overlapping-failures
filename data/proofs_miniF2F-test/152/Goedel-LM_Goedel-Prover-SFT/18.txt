  Given positive integers \( m \) and \( n \), we know that their greatest common divisor (gcd) is 8 and their least common multiple (lcm) is 112. We need to determine the least possible value of \( m + n \).
  First, we use the property that the product of the gcd and lcm of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. This gives us:
  \[ \text{gcd}(m, n) \times \text{lcm}(m, n) = m \times n \]
  Substituting the given values into this equation, we get:
  \[ 8 \times 112 = m \times n \]
  \[ 904 = m \times n \]
  Next, we need to find the least possible value of \( m + n \). We can use the fact that the gcd of \( m \) and \( n \) is 8 and the lcm is 112. By solving the equation \( 904 = m \times n \) for \( m \) and \( n \), we can determine the values of \( m \) and \( n \) that satisfy this equation.
  Using the gcd and lcm properties, we can derive that \( m \) and \( n \) must be such that their product is 904 and their gcd is 8. This implies that \( m \) and \( n \) must be multiples of 8.
  To find the least possible value of \( m + n \), we consider the smallest possible values for \( m \) and \( n \) that satisfy these conditions. The smallest values that are multiples of 8 and whose product is 904 are 16 and 56. Therefore, the least possible value of \( m + n \) is:
  \[ 16 + 56 = 72 \]
  Thus, the least possible value of \( m + n \) is 72.
