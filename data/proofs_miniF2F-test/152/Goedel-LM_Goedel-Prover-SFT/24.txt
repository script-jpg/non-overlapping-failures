  Given positive integers \( m \) and \( n \), we know that their greatest common divisor (gcd) is 8 and their least common multiple (lcm) is 112. We need to show that the least possible value of \( m + n \) is 72.
  First, we use the relationship between the gcd and lcm, which states that the product of \( m \) and \( n \) is equal to the product of their gcd and lcm. Using this relationship, we can derive the values of \( m \) and \( n \).
  Next, we use the fact that the gcd of \( m \) and \( n \) is 8 and the lcm is 112 to find the values of \( m \) and \( n \). By solving the equation derived from the gcd and lcm, we find that \( m = 16 \) and \( n = 56 \).
  Finally, we calculate the sum \( m + n \) and verify that it equals 72.
