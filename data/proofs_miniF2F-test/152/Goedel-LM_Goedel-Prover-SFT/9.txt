  Given positive integers \( m \) and \( n \), we know that their greatest common divisor (gcd) is 8 and their least common multiple (lcm) is 112. We need to find the least possible value of \( m + n \) and show that it is 72.
  1. We start by using the property that the product of the gcd and lcm of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves.
  2. Substituting the given values of gcd and lcm into this property, we obtain an equation involving \( m \) and \( n \).
  3. Simplifying this equation, we find that the product of \( m \) and \( n \) is 880.
  4. We then use the fact that the gcd of \( m \) and \( n \) is 8 to simplify the expression for \( m + n \).
  5. Finally, we use the non-negativity of the square of the difference between \( m \) and \( n \) to derive the inequality \( 72 \leq m + n \).
