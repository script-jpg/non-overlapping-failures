  Given that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of positive integers \( m \) and \( n \) is 8, and the least common multiple (lcm) of \( m \) and \( n \) is 112, we need to find the least possible value of \( m + n \).
  First, we use the relationship between the gcd and lcm of two numbers:
  \[ \text{gcd}(m, n) \times \text{lcm}(m, n) = m \times n \]
  Substituting the given values:
  \[ 8 \times 112 = m \times n \]
  \[ 896 = m \times n \]
  Next, we need to find the least possible value of \( m + n \). We start by considering the prime factorizations of \( m \) and \( n \):
  \[ m = 8k \quad \text{and} \quad n = 112k \]
  for some integer \( k \).
  To find the least \( m + n \), we set \( k = 1 \):
  \[ m = 8 \quad \text{and} \quad n = 112 \]
  Thus:
  \[ m + n = 8 + 112 = 120 \]
  However, this does not satisfy the condition of the least possible value. We need to find the smallest values of \( m \) and \( n \) that satisfy the gcd and lcm conditions. By trial and error or systematic checking, we find that the smallest values are \( m = 16 \) and \( n = 56 \):
  \[ \text{gcd}(16, 56) = 8 \]
  \[ \text{lcm}(16, 56) = 112 \]
  Thus:
  \[ m + n = 16 + 56 = 72 \]
  Therefore, the least possible value of \( m + n \) is 72.
