  Given that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of positive integers \( m \) and \( n \) is 8, and the least common multiple (lcm) of \( m \) and \( n \) is 112, we need to find the least possible value of \( m + n \).
  1. We start by using the property that the product of the gcd and lcm of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves.
  2. Using the given gcd and lcm, we calculate the product of \( m \) and \( n \) and find that it equals 88.
  3. We then use the fact that the gcd of \( m \) and \( n \) is 8 to infer that \( m \) and \( n \) must be such that their product is 88.
  4. By solving the equation \( m \times n = 88 \) and considering the gcd condition, we find that the least possible value of \( m + n \) is 72.
