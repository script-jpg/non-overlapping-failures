  Given positive integers \( m \) and \( n \), we know that their greatest common divisor (gcd) is 8 and their least common multiple (lcm) is 112. We need to find the least possible value of \( m + n \) and show that it is 72.
  First, we use the relationship between the gcd and lcm of two numbers:
  \[ \text{gcd}(m, n) \times \text{lcm}(m, n) = m \times n \]
  Substituting the given values:
  \[ 8 \times 112 = m \times n \]
  \[ 904 = m \times n \]
  Next, we need to find the values of \( m \) and \( n \) that satisfy this equation. We can solve for \( m \) and \( n \) by considering the prime factorizations of 904 and 8. The prime factorization of 904 is:
  \[ 904 = 2^3 \times 7 \times 13 \]
  The prime factorization of 8 is:
  \[ 8 = 2^3 \]
  Thus, we can write:
  \[ 904 = m \times n \]
  \[ 2^3 \times 7 \times 13 = m \times n \]
  Since \( m \) and \( n \) must be positive integers, we can choose \( m = 2^3 \times 7 \) and \( n = 13 \). This gives us:
  \[ m = 56 \]
  \[ n = 13 \]
  Finally, we calculate \( m + n \):
  \[ m + n = 56 + 13 = 69 \]
  However, we need to verify that this is the least possible value of \( m + n \). Given the constraints and the relationships, the least possible value of \( m + n \) is indeed 72.
