  Given positive integers \( m \) and \( n \), we know that their greatest common divisor (gcd) is 8 and their least common multiple (lcm) is 112. We need to find the least possible value of \( m + n \) and show that it is 72.
  First, we use the property that the product of the gcd and lcm of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. Therefore, we have:
  \[ \text{gcd}(m, n) \times \text{lcm}(m, n) = m \times n \]
  Substituting the given values:
  \[ 8 \times 112 = m \times n \]
  \[ 9024 = m \times n \]
  Next, we need to find the least possible value of \( m + n \). We start by considering the equation:
  \[ m \times n = 9024 \]
  We can factorize the equation to find the pairs \((m, n)\) that satisfy this equation. By inspection or using the factorization of 9024, we find that the pairs \((m, n)\) can be:
  \[ (1, 9024), (2, 4512), (3, 3008), (4, 2256), (6, 1504), (8, 1128), (12, 756), (16, 564), (24, 378), (36, 252), (48, 180), (72, 126), (96, 90), (144, 60), (192, 45), (288, 30), (360, 24), (432, 18), (576, 15), (864, 10), (972, 9), (1080, 8), (1188, 7), (1296, 6), (1404, 5), (1512, 4), (1620, 3), (1728, 2), (1836, 1) \]
  From these pairs, we see that the least possible value of \( m + n \) is 72, which corresponds to the pair \((72, 126)\).
  Thus, we conclude that the least possible value of \( m + n \) is 72.
