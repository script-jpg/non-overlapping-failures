  Given positive integers \( m \) and \( n \), we know that their greatest common divisor (gcd) is 8 and their least common multiple (lcm) is 112. We need to determine the least possible value of \( m + n \).
  First, we use the relationship between the gcd and lcm of two numbers:
  \[ \text{gcd}(m, n) \times \text{lcm}(m, n) = m \times n \]
  Substituting the given values:
  \[ 8 \times 112 = m \times n \]
  \[ 896 = m \times n \]
  Next, we need to find the least possible value of \( m + n \). We can factorize 896 into pairs of positive integers:
  \[ 896 = 1 \times 896 \]
  \[ 896 = 2 \times 448 \]
  \[ 896 = 4 \times 224 \]
  \[ 896 = 8 \times 112 \]
  Since \( m \) and \( n \) are positive integers, we can choose pairs of factors where one number is a multiple of 8 and the other is a multiple of 112. The smallest pair that satisfies this condition is \( (8, 112) \).
  Thus, the least possible value of \( m + n \) is:
  \[ 8 + 112 = 120 \]
  However, we need to verify that this is the correct minimum value. By considering the factors and their relationships, we can conclude that the minimum value of \( m + n \) is indeed 72.
