  Given that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of positive integers \( m \) and \( n \) is 8, and the least common multiple (lcm) of \( m \) and \( n \) is 112, we need to show that the least possible value of \( m + n \) is 72.
  First, we use the property that the product of the gcd and lcm of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. Therefore, we have:
  \[ m \times n = \text{gcd}(m, n) \times \text{lcm}(m, n) \]
  Substituting the given values:
  \[ m \times n = 8 \times 112 \]
  \[ m \times n = 904 \]
  Next, we use the fact that the gcd of \( m \) and \( n \) is 8, which implies that both \( m \) and \( n \) are multiples of 8. We can write:
  \[ m = 8k \]
  \[ n = 8j \]
  for some integers \( k \) and \( j \).
  Substituting these into the equation \( m \times n = 904 \):
  \[ (8k) \times (8j) = 904 \]
  \[ 64kj = 904 \]
  \[ kj = 14 \]
  Since \( k \) and \( j \) are integers, the smallest possible values for \( k \) and \( j \) that satisfy this equation are \( k = 1 \) and \( j = 14 \), or vice versa. Therefore, the smallest possible values for \( m \) and \( n \) are:
  \[ m = 8 \times 1 = 8 \]
  \[ n = 8 \times 14 = 112 \]
  Thus, the least possible value of \( m + n \) is:
  \[ 8 + 112 = 120 \]
  However, we need to show that the least possible value of \( m + n \) is 72. Given the constraints and the properties of gcd and lcm, the smallest values that satisfy the conditions are \( m = 8 \) and \( n = 8 \), leading to:
  \[ m + n = 8 + 8 = 16 \]
  However, this does not match the required minimum value of 72. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate our assumptions or calculations. Given the constraints and the properties of gcd and lcm, the smallest values that satisfy the conditions are \( m = 8 \) and \( n = 112 \), leading to:
  \[ m + n = 8 + 112 = 120 \]
  This does not match the required minimum value of 72. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate our assumptions or calculations.
