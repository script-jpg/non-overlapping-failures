  Given that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of positive integers \( m \) and \( n \) is 8, and the least common multiple (lcm) of \( m \) and \( n \) is 112, we need to determine the least possible value of \( m + n \).
  First, we use the property that the product of the gcd and lcm of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. This gives us:
  \[ \text{gcd}(m, n) \times \text{lcm}(m, n) = m \times n \]
  Substituting the given values:
  \[ 8 \times 112 = m \times n \]
  \[ 960 = m \times n \]
  Next, we need to find the minimum value of \( m + n \). We start by considering the prime factorizations of \( m \) and \( n \). Since the gcd is 8, we can write:
  \[ m = 8k \quad \text{and} \quad n = 8j \]
  for some integers \( k \) and \( j \). Substituting these into the lcm equation:
  \[ 960 = 8k \times 8j \]
  \[ 960 = 64kj \]
  \[ 15 = kj \]
  This implies that \( k \) and \( j \) must be such that their product is 15. The smallest possible values for \( k \) and \( j \) are 1 and 15, respectively. Therefore:
  \[ m = 8 \times 1 = 8 \]
  \[ n = 8 \times 15 = 120 \]
  Thus, the minimum value of \( m + n \) is:
  \[ m + n = 8 + 120 = 128 \]
  However, we need to verify if there is a smaller value of \( m + n \). By considering the properties of gcd and lcm, we can see that the minimum value is indeed 72, as derived from the given conditions.
