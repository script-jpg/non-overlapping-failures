  Given two positive integers \( m \) and \( n \), we know that their greatest common divisor (gcd) is 8 and their least common multiple (lcm) is 112. We need to find the least possible value of \( m + n \) and show that it is 72.
  First, we use the property that the product of the gcd and lcm of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. Therefore, we have:
  \[ \text{gcd}(m, n) \times \text{lcm}(m, n) = m \times n \]
  Substituting the given values, we get:
  \[ 8 \times 112 = m \times n \]
  \[ 904 = m \times n \]
  Next, we need to find the least possible value of \( m + n \). We can use the fact that the gcd of \( m \) and \( n \) is 8 and the lcm is 112 to find the minimum sum.
  Since the gcd of \( m \) and \( n \) is 8, the numbers \( m \) and \( n \) must be multiples of 8. We can write:
  \[ m = 8k \]
  \[ n = 8j \]
  where \( k \) and \( j \) are integers.
  Substituting these into the lcm equation:
  \[ \frac{8k \times 8j}{\text{gcd}(8k, 8j)} = 112 \]
  \[ \frac{64kj}{8} = 112 \]
  \[ 8kj = 112 \]
  \[ kj = 14 \]
  Since \( k \) and \( j \) are integers, the smallest possible values for \( k \) and \( j \) are 1 and 14 respectively. Therefore, the smallest possible values for \( m \) and \( n \) are:
  \[ m = 8 \times 1 = 8 \]
  \[ n = 8 \times 14 = 112 \]
  Thus, the least possible value of \( m + n \) is:
  \[ m + n = 8 + 112 = 120 \]
  However, we need to show that the least possible value of \( m + n \) is 72. This can be achieved by considering the smallest possible values for \( m \) and \( n \) that satisfy the gcd and lcm conditions.
