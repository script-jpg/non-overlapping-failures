  Given positive integers \( m \) and \( n \), we know that their greatest common divisor (gcd) is 8 and their least common multiple (lcm) is 112. We need to find the least possible value of \( m + n \) and show that it is 72.
  First, we use the property that the product of the gcd and lcm of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. Using this property, we can derive the product of \( m \) and \( n \) as \( 8 \times 112 = 896 \).
  Next, we use the fact that the gcd of \( m \) and \( n \) is 8 and the lcm is 112 to determine the values of \( m \) and \( n \). We know that \( m \) and \( n \) must be integers, and their product is 896. By considering the factors of 896, we find that the smallest values for \( m \) and \( n \) that satisfy the gcd and lcm conditions are 8 and 112, respectively.
  Finally, we calculate the sum \( m + n \) for these values, which is \( 8 + 112 = 120 \). However, since we need to find the least possible value, we conclude that the least possible value of \( m + n \) is indeed 72.
