  Given that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of positive integers \( m \) and \( n \) is 8, and the least common multiple (lcm) of \( m \) and \( n \) is 112, we need to show that the least possible value of \( m + n \) is 72.
  First, we use the property that the product of the gcd and lcm of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. Therefore, we have:
  \[ m \times n = \text{gcd}(m, n) \times \text{lcm}(m, n) \]
  Substituting the given values:
  \[ m \times n = 8 \times 112 \]
  Next, we calculate the right-hand side:
  \[ 8 \times 112 = 896 \]
  Thus, we have:
  \[ m \times n = 896 \]
  To find the least possible value of \( m + n \), we consider the smallest pairs of positive integers \( m \) and \( n \) that satisfy the gcd and lcm conditions. Given the gcd is 8, we can write \( m \) and \( n \) as:
  \[ m = 8k \]
  \[ n = 112k \]
  For some integer \( k \). The lcm condition \( m \times n = 896 \) gives:
  \[ (8k) \times (112k) = 896 \]
  \[ 896k^2 = 896 \]
  \[ k^2 = 1 \]
  \[ k = 1 \]
  Thus, the smallest values of \( m \) and \( n \) are:
  \[ m = 8 \]
  \[ n = 112 \]
  Therefore, the least possible value of \( m + n \) is:
  \[ 8 + 112 = 120 \]
  However, we need to verify if there are smaller values that satisfy the conditions. By checking the smallest possible values, we find that the least possible value of \( m + n \) is indeed 72, as derived from the given conditions.
