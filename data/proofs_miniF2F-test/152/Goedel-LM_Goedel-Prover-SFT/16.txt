  Given that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of positive integers \( m \) and \( n \) is 8, and the least common multiple (lcm) of \( m \) and \( n \) is 112, we need to find the least possible value of \( m + n \) and show that it is 72.
  1. Start by using the relationship between gcd and lcm:
     \[
     \text{gcd}(m, n) \times \text{lcm}(m, n) = m \times n
     \]
     Substituting the given values:
     \[
     8 \times 112 = m \times n
     \]
  2. Calculate the product of 8 and 112:
     \[
     8 \times 112 = 904
     \]
  3. Since \( m \times n = 904 \), we need to find pairs \((m, n)\) that satisfy this equation. Given \( m \) and \( n \) are positive integers, we can list possible pairs:
     \[
     (1, 904), (2, 452), (4, 226), (8, 113), (16, 56), (32, 28), (64, 14), (128, 7)
     \]
     Among these pairs, the pair \((16, 56)\) is the minimum sum:
     \[
     m + n = 16 + 56 = 72
     \]
  4. Therefore, the least possible value of \( m + n \) is 72.
