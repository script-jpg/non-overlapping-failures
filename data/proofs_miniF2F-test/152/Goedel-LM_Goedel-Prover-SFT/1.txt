  Given positive integers \( m \) and \( n \), we know that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( m \) and \( n \) is 8. The least common multiple (lcm) of \( m \) and \( n \) is 112. We need to determine the least possible value of \( m + n \).
  First, we use the relationship between the gcd and lcm of two numbers, which states that the product of the two numbers is equal to the product of their gcd and lcm. Therefore, we have:
  \[ m \times n = \text{gcd}(m, n) \times \text{lcm}(m, n) \]
  Substituting the given values, we get:
  \[ m \times n = 8 \times 112 \]
  \[ m \times n = 896 \]
  Next, we need to find the least possible value of \( m + n \). We can use the fact that the product \( m \times n \) is 896 and the gcd of \( m \) and \( n \) is 8. We need to consider the pairs of numbers that multiply to 896 and check their sum.
  By examining the factors of 896, we find that the pairs of numbers that multiply to 896 and sum to the least possible value of \( m + n \) are 16 and 56. Thus, the least possible value of \( m + n \) is:
  \[ 16 + 56 = 72 \]

  have h₃ : m * n = Nat.gcd m n * Nat.lcm m n := by simp [Nat.gcd_mul_lcm]
  -- Substitute the given values into the equation
  rw [h₁, h₂] at h₃
  -- Simplify the equation to find the product of m and n
  norm_num at h₃
  -- Use the fact that the product of m and n is 896 and the sum of the least possible values of m and n is 72
  apply Nat.le_of_not_lt
  intro h₄
  -- If m + n < 72, then the product of m and n would exceed 896, which is a contradiction
  have h₅ : m < 72 := by linarith
  have h₆ : n < 72 := by linarith
  -- Use interval_cases to check all possible values of m and n
