  Given that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of positive integers \( m \) and \( n \) is 8, and the least common multiple (lcm) of \( m \) and \( n \) is 112, we need to determine the least possible value of \( m + n \).
  First, we use the property that the product of the gcd and lcm of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. This gives us:
  \[ \text{gcd}(m, n) \times \text{lcm}(m, n) = m \times n \]
  Substituting the given values:
  \[ 8 \times 112 = m \times n \]
  \[ 904 = m \times n \]
  Next, we need to find the least possible value of \( m + n \). We can use the fact that the product of \( m \) and \( n \) is 904 and both \( m \) and \( n \) are positive integers. We will consider the possible pairs \((m, n)\) that satisfy these conditions and check the sum \( m + n \).
  By examining the pairs of positive integers that multiply to 904, we find that the pairs \((1, 904)\), \((2, 452)\), \((4, 226)\), \((8, 113)\), \((16, 57)\), and \((32, 29)\) are the only pairs where both numbers are positive integers and their product is 904.
  Among these pairs, the sum \( m + n \) ranges from:
  \[ 1 + 904 = 905 \]
  \[ 2 + 452 = 454 \]
  \[ 4 + 226 = 230 \]
  \[ 8 + 113 = 121 \]
  \[ 16 + 57 = 73 \]
  \[ 32 + 29 = 61 \]
  The least possible value of \( m + n \) is 72, which corresponds to the pair \((16, 57)\).
