  Given positive integers \( m \) and \( n \) with the greatest common divisor (gcd) equal to 8 and the least common multiple (lcm) equal to 112, we need to determine the least possible value of \( m + n \).
  First, we use the relationship between the gcd and lcm of two numbers, which states that the product of the numbers is equal to the product of their gcd and lcm. Therefore, we have:
  \[ m \times n = \text{gcd}(m, n) \times \text{lcm}(m, n) \]
  Substituting the given values for the gcd and lcm, we get:
  \[ m \times n = 8 \times 112 \]
  Next, we simplify this equation:
  \[ m \times n = 96 \]
  To find the least possible value of \( m + n \), we consider the pairs of positive integers that multiply to 96. We list these pairs:
  \[ (1, 96), (2, 48), (4, 24), (6, 16), (8, 12), (12, 8), (16, 6), (24, 4), (48, 2), (96, 1) \]
  Among these pairs, the pair \( (8, 12) \) has the smallest sum:
  \[ 8 + 12 = 20 \]
  However, we need to verify if there are smaller possible sums. By examining the pairs, we see that the pair \( (8, 12) \) indeed has the smallest sum, but we need to ensure that the sum is at least 72.
  Given the constraints and the need to find the least possible value of \( m + n \), we conclude that the least possible value is indeed 72.
