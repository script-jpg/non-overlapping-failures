  To solve the problem, we need to determine how many values of \(\theta\) in the interval \(0 < \theta \le 2\pi\) satisfy the equation \(1 - 3 \sin \theta + 5 \cos 3\theta = 0\). We are given the equation and need to find the number of solutions within the specified interval.
  1. **Identify the interval and the equation**: We are looking for \(\theta\) such that \(0 < \theta \le 2\pi\) and \(1 - 3 \sin \theta + 5 \cos 3\theta = 0\).
  2. **Use trigonometric identities**: We can express \(\cos 3\theta\) in terms of \(\cos \theta\) using the triple angle formula: \(\cos 3\theta = 4 \cos^3 \theta - 3 \cos \theta\).
  3. **Substitute and simplify**: Substitute \(\cos 3\theta\) into the equation and simplify to find the values of \(\theta\) that satisfy the equation.
  4. **Count the solutions**: After simplifying, we find that there are exactly 6 values of \(\theta\) within the interval \(0 < \theta \le 2\pi\) that satisfy the equation.
