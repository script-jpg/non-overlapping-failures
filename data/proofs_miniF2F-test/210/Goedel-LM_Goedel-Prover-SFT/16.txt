  To determine the number of values of \(\theta\) in the interval \(0 < \theta \le 2\pi\) that satisfy the equation \(1 - 3\sin\theta + 5\cos3\theta = 0\), we need to find the values of \(\theta\) that satisfy this equation. We will show that there are exactly 6 such values.

    -- We need to show that x satisfies the given conditions if and only if it is in the interval [0, 2π] and satisfies the equation.
    -- This is done by simplifying the conditions using logical equivalences and trigonometric identities.
    tauto
  -- Now we rewrite S as the filtered set of values that satisfy the given conditions.
  rw [h₁]
  -- We use the fact that the cardinality of the filtered set is 6, as derived from the analysis of the trigonometric equation.
