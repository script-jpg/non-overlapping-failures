  To determine the number of values of \(\theta\) in the interval \(0 < \theta \le 2\pi\) that satisfy the equation \(1 - 3\sin\theta + 5\cos3\theta = 0\), we start by analyzing the given equation. We need to find the values of \(\theta\) that satisfy this equation.
  1. **Identify the trigonometric identities**:
     - \(\sin\theta\) and \(\cos\theta\) are trigonometric functions.
     - \(\sin3\theta = 3\sin\theta - 4\sin^3\theta\) and \(\cos3\theta = 4\cos^3\theta - 3\cos\theta\).
  2. **Substitute trigonometric identities into the equation**:
     - \(\sin\theta = \frac{1}{3}\sin\theta + \frac{2}{3}\sin\theta = \frac{1}{3}\sin\theta + \frac{2}{3}\sin\theta = \sin\theta\).
     - \(\cos\theta = \frac{1}{3}\cos\theta + \frac{2}{3}\cos\theta = \frac{1}{3}\cos\theta + \frac{2}{3}\cos\theta = \cos\theta\).
  3. **Simplify the equation**:
     - \(1 - 3\sin\theta + 5\cos3\theta = 0\).
     - Substitute \(\sin3\theta\) and \(\cos3\theta\) into the equation:
       \[
       1 - 3\sin\theta + 5(4\cos^3\theta - 3\cos\theta) = 0.
       \]
     - Simplify:
       \[
       1 - 3\sin\theta + 20\cos^3\theta - 15\cos\theta = 0.
       \]
  4. **Solve for \(\theta\)**:
     - We need to find \(\theta\) such that the equation holds.
     - By solving the equation, we find that \(\theta\) can be any value in the interval \(0 < \theta \le 2\pi\) that satisfies the equation.
  5. **Count the solutions**:
     - The solutions to the equation are \(\theta = 0, \pi, 2\pi, 3\pi, 4\pi, 5\pi\).
     - There are 6 solutions.
  Thus, the number of values of \(\theta\) in the interval \(0 < \theta \le 2\pi\) that satisfy the equation \(1 - 3\sin\theta + 5\cos3\theta = 0\) is \(\textbf{(D) }6\).
