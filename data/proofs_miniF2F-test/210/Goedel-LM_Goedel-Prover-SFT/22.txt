  To determine the number of values of \(\theta\) in the interval \(0 < \theta \le 2\pi\) that satisfy the equation \(1 - 3\sin\theta + 5\cos3\theta = 0\), we need to find the values of \(\theta\) that satisfy this equation. We will show that there are exactly 6 such values.

  -- has exactly 6 elements by demonstrating that the set is equivalent to the set of solutions to the equation
