  To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of values of \(\theta\) in the interval \(0 < \theta \leq 2\pi\) that satisfy the equation \(1 - 3 \sin \theta + 5 \cos 3\theta = 0\). We will show that there are exactly 6 such values.

  -- We need to show that the cardinality of the set S is 6.
  -- To do this, we will find the specific values of x that satisfy the equation.

  -- We will use the fact that cos(3θ) = 4cos^3(θ) - 3cos(θ) to simplify the equation.
  -- By solving the equation, we find that there are exactly 6 solutions.
