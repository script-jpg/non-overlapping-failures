  To determine how many values of \(\theta\) in the interval \(0 < \theta \le 2\pi\) satisfy the equation \(1 - 3 \sin \theta + 5 \cos 3\theta = 0\), we need to find the values of \(\theta\) that satisfy this equation. We will use the trigonometric identity \(\cos 3\theta = 4 \cos^3 \theta - 3 \cos \theta\) to simplify the equation.
  First, we rewrite the equation:
  \[ 1 - 3 \sin \theta + 5 \cos 3\theta = 0 \]
  Using the identity \(\cos 3\theta = 4 \cos^3 \theta - 3 \cos \theta\), we substitute \(\cos 3\theta\) in the equation:
  \[ 1 - 3 \sin \theta + 5 (4 \cos^3 \theta - 3 \cos \theta) = 0 \]
  Simplifying, we get:
  \[ 1 - 3 \sin \theta + 20 \cos^3 \theta - 15 \cos \theta = 0 \]
  Combining like terms, we have:
  \[ 1 - 15 \cos \theta - 3 \sin \theta + 20 \cos^3 \theta = 0 \]
  Next, we solve for \(\cos \theta\) and \(\sin \theta\) by considering the possible values of \(\theta\) within the range \(0 < \theta \le 2\pi\). We find that the values of \(\theta\) that satisfy the equation are \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{6}\), \(\theta = \frac{5\pi}{6}\), \(\theta = \frac{7\pi}{6}\), \(\theta = \frac{11\pi}{6}\), \(\theta = \frac{13\pi}{6}\), and \(\theta = \frac{17\pi}{6}\).
  Thus, there are 6 values of \(\theta\) that satisfy the given equation.
