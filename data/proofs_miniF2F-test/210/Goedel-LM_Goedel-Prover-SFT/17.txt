  To determine the number of values of \(\theta\) in the interval \(0 < \theta \le 2\pi\) that satisfy the equation \(1 - 3 \sin \theta + 5 \cos 3\theta = 0\), we need to find the solutions to this equation within the specified range. The equation involves trigonometric functions, and we can use the properties of trigonometric functions and their ranges to find the solutions.
