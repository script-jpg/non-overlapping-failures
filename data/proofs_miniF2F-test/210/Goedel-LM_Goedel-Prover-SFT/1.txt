  To determine the number of values of \(\theta\) in the interval \(0 < \theta \le 2\pi\) that satisfy the equation \(1 - 3\sin \theta + 5\cos 3\theta = 0\), we need to find the values of \(\theta\) that satisfy this equation. We will use the given equation and the properties of trigonometric functions to find these values.
