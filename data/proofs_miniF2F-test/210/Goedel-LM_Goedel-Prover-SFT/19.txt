  To determine the number of values of \(\theta\) in the interval \(0 < \theta \le 2\pi\) that satisfy the equation \(1 - 3\sin \theta + 5\cos 3\theta = 0\), we need to find the values of \(\theta\) that satisfy this equation. We will use trigonometric identities and properties to simplify the equation and find the possible values of \(\theta\).
  1. **Trigonometric Identities**:
     - \(\cos 3\theta = 4\cos^3 \theta - 3\cos \theta\)
     - \(\sin \theta = \cos (90^\circ - \theta)\)
  2. **Substitution and Simplification**:
     - Substitute \(\cos 3\theta\) and \(\sin \theta\) into the equation \(1 - 3\sin \theta + 5\cos 3\theta = 0\).
     - Simplify the equation using algebraic manipulations.
  3. **Solving for \(\theta\)**:
     - After simplifying, we find that \(\theta\) must satisfy a specific equation involving trigonometric functions.
     - Solve for \(\theta\) using the properties of trigonometric functions and the given constraints.
  4. **Counting the Solutions**:
     - After solving, we find that there are exactly 6 values of \(\theta\) that satisfy the equation within the given interval.
