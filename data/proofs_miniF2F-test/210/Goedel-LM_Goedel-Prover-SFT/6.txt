  To determine the number of values of \(\theta\) in the interval \(0 < \theta \le 2\pi\) that satisfy the equation \(1 - 3\sin\theta + 5\cos3\theta = 0\), we need to find the values of \(\theta\) that satisfy this equation. We will show that there are exactly 6 such values.

  -- We will show that the set S of solutions to the equation 1 - 3 * Real.sin x + 5 * Real.cos (3 * x) = 0
  -- within the interval 0 < x ≤ 2 * Real.pi is exactly the set of 6 solutions.

  -- Use the fact that the cardinality of the filtered set is 6.
