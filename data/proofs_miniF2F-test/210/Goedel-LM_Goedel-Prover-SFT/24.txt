  To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of values of \(\theta\) in the interval \(0 < \theta \leq 2\pi\) that satisfy the equation \(1 - 3\sin\theta + 5\cos3\theta = 0\). We will show that there are exactly 6 such values.

  -- We will show that the set S of solutions to the equation has exactly 6 elements.
  have h₁ : S = Finset.filter (fun x => 0 < x ∧ x ≤ 2 * Real.pi ∧ 1 - 3 * Real.sin x + 5 * Real.cos (3 * x) = 0) (Finset.Icc 0 (2 * Real.pi)) := by
    ext x
    -- We need to show that x is in S if and only if x is in the interval [0, 2π] and satisfies the equation.
    simp [h₀, Finset.mem_Icc]
    -- This is done by simplifying the conditions using the given hypothesis h₀ and the properties of the interval [0, 2π].
  rw [h₁]
  -- Rewrite S using the filter and the interval [0, 2π].
