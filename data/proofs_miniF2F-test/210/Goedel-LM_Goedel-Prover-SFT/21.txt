  To determine the number of values of \(\theta\) in the interval \(0 < \theta \le 2\pi\) that satisfy the equation \(1 - 3\sin\theta + 5\cos3\theta = 0\), we start by analyzing the given equation. The equation can be rewritten as:
  \[ 1 - 3\sin\theta + 5\cos3\theta = 0 \]
  We need to find the values of \(\theta\) that satisfy this equation within the specified interval. By examining the trigonometric functions and their properties, we can deduce that the equation can be satisfied by specific values of \(\theta\).
  Given the constraints \(0 < \theta \le 2\pi\), we can use the periodicity and properties of the trigonometric functions to determine the number of solutions. Specifically, we can check the values of \(\theta\) that satisfy the equation and the bounds.
