  To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of values of \(\theta\) in the interval \(0 < \theta \leq 2\pi\) that satisfy the equation \(1 - 3\sin\theta + 5\cos3\theta = 0\). We will show that there are exactly 6 such values.

  -- We will show that the set S of solutions to the equation is exactly the set of values satisfying the conditions.
  have h₁ : S = Finset.filter (fun x => 0 < x ∧ x ≤ 2 * Real.pi ∧ 1 - 3 * Real.sin x + 5 * Real.cos (3 * x) = 0) (Finset.range (2 * Real.pi)) := by
    ext x
    simp [h₀, Finset.mem_filter, Finset.mem_range]
    -- We need to show that x is in S if and only if it satisfies the given conditions.
    -- This involves checking the conditions for x and ensuring they are equivalent.

    -- Given the conditions, we need to show that x satisfies the equation.
    -- We use the given conditions to construct the proof.

    linarith [Real.sin_le_one x, Real.cos_le_one x, Real.sin_le_one (3 * x), Real.cos_le_one (3 * x)]
  -- Now we substitute the expression for S into the goal.
  rw [h₁]
  -- We simplify the expression to show that the cardinality of S is 6.
  simp only [Finset.card_filter]
  -- We use the fact that the cardinality of the set of values satisfying the conditions is 6.
