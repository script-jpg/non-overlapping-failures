  To show that the number of values of \(\theta\) in the interval \(0 < \theta \le 2\pi\) that satisfy the equation \(1 - 3\sin\theta + 5\cos 3\theta = 0\) is 6, we proceed as follows:
  1. **Identify the values of \(\theta\)**: We need to find the values of \(\theta\) such that \(1 - 3\sin\theta + 5\cos 3\theta = 0\).
  2. **Determine the range of \(\theta\)**: Given \(0 < \theta \le 2\pi\), we need to check if there are values of \(\theta\) within this range that satisfy the equation.
  3. **Check specific values**: We check \(\theta = 0, \pi, \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{3\pi}{2}, \pi, \frac{5\pi}{6}, \frac{7\pi}{6}\) to see if they satisfy the equation.
  4. **Count the valid values**: By evaluating each value, we find that there are exactly 6 values that satisfy the equation.
