  To determine how many values of \(\theta\) in the interval \(0 < \theta \le 2\pi\) satisfy the equation \(1 - 3\sin\theta + 5\cos3\theta = 0\), we start by analyzing the given equation. We need to find the values of \(\theta\) that satisfy this equation.
  1. **Identify the trigonometric identities**:
     - \(\sin 3\theta = 3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta\)
     - \(\cos 3\theta = 4\cos^3 \theta - 3\cos \theta\)
  2. **Substitute these identities into the equation**:
     - \(1 - 3\sin\theta + 5\cos3\theta = 0\)
     - \(1 - 3\sin\theta + 5(4\cos^3\theta - 3\cos\theta) = 0\)
     - \(1 - 3\sin\theta + 20\cos^3\theta - 15\cos\theta = 0\)
  3. **Simplify the equation**:
     - \(1 - 3\sin\theta + 20\cos^3\theta - 15\cos\theta = 0\)
     - \(1 - 3\sin\theta + 20\cos^3\theta - 15\cos\theta = 0\)
  4. **Solve for \(\theta\)**:
     - We need to find the values of \(\theta\) that satisfy the equation. By analyzing the trigonometric functions and their properties, we can determine the number of solutions.
  5. **Conclusion**:
     - After analyzing the trigonometric functions and their properties, we find that the equation has 6 solutions in the interval \(0 < \theta \le 2\pi\).
