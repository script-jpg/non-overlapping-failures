  To determine the number of values of \(\theta\) in the interval \(0 < \theta \le 2\pi\) that satisfy the equation \(1 - 3\sin\theta + 5\cos3\theta = 0\), we need to find the values of \(\theta\) that satisfy this equation. We will use the given equation and the properties of trigonometric functions to find the solutions.
  1. **Identify the equation**: \(1 - 3\sin\theta + 5\cos3\theta = 0\).
  2. **Use trigonometric identities**: We know that \(\cos3\theta = 4\cos^3\theta - 3\cos\theta\).
  3. **Substitute and solve**: Substitute \(\cos3\theta\) into the equation and solve for \(\theta\).
