  To determine the number of values of \(\theta\) in the interval \(0 < \theta \le 2\pi\) that satisfy the equation \(1 - 3\sin \theta + 5 \cos 3\theta = 0\), we need to analyze the given equation and find the values of \(\theta\) that satisfy it. We will use trigonometric identities and properties to simplify the equation and find the valid values of \(\theta\).
