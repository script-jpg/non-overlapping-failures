-- We need to show that there are 100 such numbers.

  -- The straightforward way to do this is to iterate over all 4-digit numbers,
  -- check if all digits are even and if the number is divisible by 5,
  -- and count how many numbers satisfy these conditions.

  -- To do this Lean 1.15 code would be:

  have h₁ : S = Finset.filter (fun n => 1000 ≤ n ∧ n ≤ 9999 ∧ (∀ d : ℕ, d ∈ Nat.digits 10 n → Even d) ∧ 5 ∣ n) (Finset.Icc 1000 9999) := by
    ext n
    simp [h₀]
    tauto

  -- Then we can rewrite the set as a Finset.filter to make it easier to compute the cardinality.

  -- The Lean 1.15 code to do this is:

  have h₂ : S.card = (Finset.filter (fun n => 1000 ≤ n ∧ n ≤ 9999 ∧ (∀ d : ℕ, d ∈ Nat.digits 10 n → Even d) ∧ 5 ∣ n) (Finset.Icc 1000 9999)).card := by rw [h₁]
  rw [h₂]

  -- Now we can compute the cardinality directly.

  -- The Lean 1.15 code to do this is:
