-- We can decompose the problem in two parts.
  -- 1. How many numbers satisfy properties $P$ (e.g. $1000 \leq n \leq 9999$, all digits are even), and
  -- 2. How many numbers satisfy $P$ and are divisible by $5$.
  -- Let's tackle part (1) first.
  have h₁ : S.card = Nat.count (fun n => 1000 ≤ n ∧ n ≤ 9999 ∧ (∀ d : ℕ, d ∈ Nat.digits 10 n → Even d)) 1000 9999 := by
    -- Note that $S$ is the set of all numbers $n$ such that $1000 \leq n \leq 9999$ and all digits of $n$ are even.
    rw [h₀]
    -- We can characterize the set $S$ as the set of all numbers $n$ such that $1000 \leq n \leq 9999$ and all digits of $n$ are even.
    rw [Finset.card_iff_card]
    -- And the set on the RHS is precisely the set of all numbers $n$ such that $1000 \leq n \leq 9999$ and all digits of $n$ are even.

  rw [h₁]
  -- Let's analyze the structure of the numbers $n$ such that $1000 \leq n \leq 9999$ and all digits of $n$ are even.
  -- The numbers are of the form $n = \overline{abcd}$, where $a, b, c, d$ are digits, $a \neq 0$, and $a, b, c, d$ are even.
  -- The possible digits are $0, 2, 4, 6, 8$. The first digit cannot be $0$.
  -- So the count is $4 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 = 500$.
  -- But wait, the numbers must be divisible by $5$.
  -- Then the last digit must be either $0$ or $5$. Since $5$ is odd, the last digit must be $0$.
  -- So the count is $4 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 1 = 100$.
