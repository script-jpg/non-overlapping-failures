-- We need to count numbers in the range [1000, 9999] with all even digits divisible by 5
  -- A number is divisible by 5 if and only if its last digit is 0 or 5
  -- But we need all digits to be even, so the last digit must be 0 (the only even digit that's divisible by 5)
  -- The other three digits must be chosen from {0, 2, 4, 6, 8} with the first digit non-zero
  -- Let's count: 
  -- First digit: 4 options (1-9, even), but actually 5 options (0-8, even) for the first digit since it can be zero in this context
  -- Second digit: 5 options (0-8, even)
  -- Third digit: 5 options (0-8, even)
  -- Fourth digit: 1 option (0)
  -- Total: 5 × 5 × 5 × 1 = 125
  -- But wait, this is not right. Let's recalculate
  -- First digit: 4 options (2,4,6,8) since it can't be zero
  -- Second digit: 5 options (0,2,4,6,8)
  -- Third digit: 5 options (0,2,4,6,8)
  -- Fourth digit: 1 option (0)
  -- Total: 4 × 5 × 5 × 1 = 100
  -- This is the correct answer
