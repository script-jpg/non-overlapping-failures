-- We need to count numbers in the range 1000 to 9999 (inclusive) with all even digits that are divisible by 5
  -- We can iterate over all numbers in the range and count those that satisfy our conditions

  -- First, let's think about the structure of such numbers:
  -- A 4-digit number is of the form ABCD where A, B, C, D are digits and A ≠ 0
  -- All digits must be even, so they must be one of {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}
  -- The number must be divisible by 5, so the last digit D must be 0 or 5
  -- But D must be even, so D must be 0

  -- Let's simplify the approach:
  -- We can iterate over all 4-digit numbers and count those with all even digits that are divisible by 5

  -- Start by filtering numbers in the range 1000-9999 that are divisible by 5
  -- A number is divisible by 5 if it ends in 0 or 5
  -- But since we need all digits to be even, the number must end in 0

  -- Let's compute the count directly:
  -- First digit (A): 5 options (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) but must be even, so 2 options (2, 4, 6, 8)
  -- Second digit (B): 5 options (0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9) but must be even, so 3 options (0, 2, 4, 6, 8)
  -- Third digit (C): 5 options (0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9) but must be even, so 3 options (0, 2, 4, 6, 8)
  -- Fourth digit (D): 1 option (0)

  -- Total = 2 * 3 * 3 * 1 = 18

  -- But wait, let's recount:
  -- First digit (A): 4 options (2, 4, 6, 8)
  -- Second digit (B): 5 options (0, 2, 4, 6, 8)
  -- Third digit (C): 5 options (0, 2, 4, 6, 8)
  -- Fourth digit (D): 1 option (0)

  -- Total = 4 * 5 * 5 * 1 = 100

  -- That's better. Let's do the formal proof:

  have : S = Finset.filter (fun n => 1000 ≤ n ∧ n ≤ 9999 ∧ (∀ d : ℕ, d ∈ Nat.digits 10 n → Even d) ∧ 5 ∣ n) (Finset.Icc 1000 9999) := by
