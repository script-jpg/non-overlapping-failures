-- We need to count numbers in the range [1000, 9999] with all even digits that are divisible by 5
  -- A number is divisible by 5 if and only if its last digit is 0 or 5
  -- But since we want even digits only, the last digit must be 0
  -- The remaining digits (thousands, hundreds, tens) can be 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8
  -- Let's count the possibilities for each digit:
  -- - Thousands digit: 9 possibilities (1-9, cannot be 0)
  -- - Hundreds digit: 5 possibilities (0,2,4,6,8)
  -- - Tens digit: 5 possibilities (0,2,4,6,8)
  -- - Units digit (must be 0): 1 possibility
  -- Total: 9 × 5 × 5 × 1 = 225 possibilities if we allow leading zeros
  -- But we cannot have leading zeros, so we must subtract the cases where the thousands digit is 0
  -- If the thousands digit is 0, we have:
  -- - Hundreds digit: 5 possibilities (0,2,4,6,8)
  -- - Tens digit: 5 possibilities (0,2,4,6,8)
  -- - Units digit (must be 0): 1 possibility
  -- Total: 5 × 5 × 1 = 25 possibilities for each of the 9 allowed leading digits
  -- Wait, that's not right. If we fix the thousands digit, the remaining digits have 5 options each
  -- So the count is 5 × 5 × 5 = 125 for each possible thousands digit
  -- So total is 9 × 5 × 5 × 5 = 625 if we allow leading zeros
  -- But we must subtract the cases where the thousands digit is 0
  -- If the thousands digit is 0, we have 5 × 5 × 5 = 125 possibilities
  -- So the final count should be 625 - 125 = 500? But that's not one of the answer choices
  -- Let me reconsider...
  -- The thousands digit must be non-zero, so it has 4 options (2,4,6,8) if we require all digits to be even
  -- The hundreds, tens, and units digits have 5 options each (0,2,4,6,8)
  -- So the count is 4 × 5 × 5 × 5 = 4 × 125 = 500 if we require all digits to be even and the number to be divisible by 5
  -- But that's not one of the answer choices
  -- Let me consider the formal approach
  -- We need to define the set of 4-digit numbers with all even digits that are divisible by 5
  -- We can represent a 4-digit number as $n = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d$ where $1 \leq a \leq 9$ and $0 \leq b,c,d \leq 9$
  -- For all digits to be even, $a,b,c,d$ must be in $\{0,2,4,6,8\}$
  -- For divisibility by 5, $d$ must be in $\{0,5\}$
  -- But since all digits must be even, $d$ must be 0
  -- So $a \in \{2,4,6,8\}$ and $b,c \in \{0,2,4,6,8\}$
  -- The count is $4 \times 5 \times 5 = 100$
  -- So the answer should be (B) 100
  -- Let's continue with the Lean proof
