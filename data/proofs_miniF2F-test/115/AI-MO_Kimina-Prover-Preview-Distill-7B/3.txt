-- We need to count numbers in the range [1000, 9999] with all even digits that are divisible by 5
  -- A number is divisible by 5 if and only if its last digit is 0 or 5
  -- But we want only even digits, so the last digit must be 0
  -- The remaining digits (thousands, hundreds, tens) must also be even
  -- Let's think about how to count these numbers systematically

  -- We could try to count all such numbers directly by iterating over the range and checking the conditions
  -- But in Lean, we'll prove this by showing that the set S has cardinality 100 using the given properties

  have h1 : S.card = 100 := by
    -- We need to compute the cardinality of S, which is defined as the set of numbers in [1000, 9999] with all even digits divisible by 5
    rw [Finset.card]
    -- We need to show that exactly 100 numbers satisfy our conditions
    -- Let's think about how to approach this

    -- We'll use the given property to determine membership in S
    -- A number n is in S if and only if:
    -- 1. 1000 ≤ n ≤ 9999
    -- 2. All digits of n are even
    -- 3. 5 divides n

    -- Since n is in the range [1000, 9999], it's a 4-digit number
    -- Let n = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, where a, b, c, d are digits
    -- For n to be in S, we need:
    -- - 1 ≤ a ≤ 9 (a is non-zero)
    -- - 0 ≤ b ≤ 9
    -- - 0 ≤ c ≤ 9
    -- - 0 ≤ d ≤ 9
    -- - a, b, c, d are even
    -- - 5 divides n

    -- For 5 to divide n, we need d = 0 or d = 5
    -- But d must be even, so d = 0 is the only possibility
    -- Thus, n ends in 0

    -- Now, let's think about the other digits:
    -- - a (thousands digit) must be even and non-zero, so a ∈ {2, 4, 6, 8}
    -- - b (hundreds digit) must be even, so b ∈ {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}
    -- - c (tens digit) must be even, so c ∈ {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}
    -- - d (units digit) must be 0 (as established)

    -- Let's count the possibilities:
    -- - 4 choices for a
    -- - 5 choices for b
    -- - 5 choices for c
    -- - 1 choice for d (must be 0)
    -- Total: 4 × 5 × 5 × 1 = 100

    -- Now, let's complete the Lean proof
    -- We'll use the given property to compute the cardinality of S directly
    have h : ∀ n : ℕ, n ∈ S ↔ 1000 ≤ n ∧ n ≤ 9999 ∧ (∀ d : ℕ, d ∈ Nat.digits 10 n → Even d) ∧ 5 ∣ n := h₀
