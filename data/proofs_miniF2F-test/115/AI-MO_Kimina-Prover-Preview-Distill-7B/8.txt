  -- We will count the numbers by considering the possible digits in each place.
  -- We will use the fact that a number is divisible by 5 if and only if its units digit is 0 or 5.
  -- Since we only have even digits, the units digit must be 0.
  -- The thousands digit can be 2, 4, 6, or 8 (since it cannot be 0).
  -- The hundreds and tens digits can be 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.
  -- Therefore, there are 4 * 5 * 5 = 100 such numbers.
