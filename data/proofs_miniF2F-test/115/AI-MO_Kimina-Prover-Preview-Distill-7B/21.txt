-- We are given a set $S$ of numbers satisfying certain properties.
  -- We need to prove that the cardinality of this set is 100.

  -- extract the set from the hypothesis
  have h₁ : S = {n | 1000 ≤ n ∧ n ≤ 9999 ∧ (∀ d : ℕ, d ∈ Nat.digits 10 n → Even d) ∧ 5 ∣ n} := by
    ext n
    simp [h₀]

  -- Now we need to count the numbers in this set.
  -- A number is in this set if and only if:
  -- 1. It is a 4-digit number (between 1000 and 9999 inclusive)
  -- 2. All its digits are even
  -- 3. It is divisible by 5

  -- To solve this, we can iterate over all 4-digit numbers and count those satisfying the conditions.

  -- First, let's think about how to approach this problem.
  -- We need to count numbers from 1000 to 9999 inclusive where:
  -- - All digits are even
  -- - The number is divisible by 5

  -- A number is divisible by 5 if and only if its last digit is 0 or 5.
  -- But since all digits must be even, the last digit must be 0 (since 5 is not even).

  -- So we need to count numbers of the form _ _ _ 0 where all digits are even and the first digit is non-zero.

  -- The even digits are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8.
  -- But the first digit cannot be 0 (since it's a 4-digit number).

  -- So we have:
  -- 1. First digit: 2, 4, 6, 8 (4 choices)
  -- 2. Second digit: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 (5 choices)
  -- 3. Third digit: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 (5 choices)
  -- 4. Fourth digit: 0 (1 choice)

  -- Total numbers = 4 × 5 × 5 × 1 = 100

  -- Let's verify this with Lean code:
