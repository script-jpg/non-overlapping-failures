  To show that the number of 4-digit positive integers with only even digits that are divisible by 5 is 100, we start by defining the set \( S \) of such integers. We then prove that \( S \) is equivalent to the set of integers from 1000 to 9999 that satisfy the conditions of having only even digits and being divisible by 5. Finally, we use the properties of finite sets and modular arithmetic to show that the cardinality of \( S \) is indeed 100.
