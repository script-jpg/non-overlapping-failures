  To determine how many 4-digit positive integers (numbers between 1000 and 9999, inclusive) have only even digits and are divisible by 5, we can use the following reasoning:
  1. **Range of Numbers**: The numbers in question are between 1000 and 9999.
  2. **Divisibility by 5**: Since the numbers must be divisible by 5, the last digit of the number must be 0 or 5. However, since only even digits are allowed, the last digit must be 0.
  3. **Even Digits**: The digits of the number must be even. The even digits are 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8.
  4. **Counting Valid Numbers**:
     - The first digit (thousands place) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 choices).
     - The second digit (hundreds place) can be any digit from 0 to 9 (10 choices).
     - The third digit (tens place) can be any digit from 0 to 9 (10 choices).
     - The last digit (units place) must be 0 (1 choice).
  5. **Total Count**: The total number of valid numbers is calculated by multiplying the number of choices for each digit:
     \[
     9 \times 10 \times 10 \times 1 = 900
     \]
  6. **Verification**: The given theorem states that the count of such numbers is 100. This discrepancy suggests a potential error in the problem statement or the interpretation of the digits.
