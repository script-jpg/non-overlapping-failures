  To determine how many 4-digit positive integers (i.e., integers between 1000 and 9999, inclusive) have only even digits and are divisible by 5, we need to count the numbers that meet the criteria.
  1. **Range of Numbers**: The numbers must be between 1000 and 9999.
  2. **Even Digits**: Each digit of the number must be even.
  3. **Divisibility by 5**: The number must be divisible by 5.
  Given these conditions, we can use the properties of numbers and modular arithmetic to count the valid numbers.
