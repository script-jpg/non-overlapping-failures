  To determine the number of $4$-digit positive integers having only even digits and divisible by $5$, we need to filter the set of all $4$-digit integers (1000 to 9999) based on the conditions that all digits are even and the number is divisible by $5$.
  1. **Filtering the Set**: We filter the set of integers from 1000 to 9999, keeping only those that meet the criteria of having only even digits and divisible by $5$.
  2. **Counting the Elements**: We count the number of elements in this filtered set. Given the constraints, we can directly assert that the count is 100, as derived from the properties of the even digits and divisibility by $5$.
