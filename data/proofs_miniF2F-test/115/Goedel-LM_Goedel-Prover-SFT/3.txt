  To determine how many 4-digit positive integers (i.e., integers between 1000 and 9999, inclusive) have only even digits and are divisible by 5, we need to count the integers that satisfy these conditions.
  1. **Range of Numbers**: The integers range from 1000 to 9999.
  2. **Divisibility by 5**: The integers must be divisible by 5.
  3. **Only Even Digits**: The digits of the integers must be even.
  Given these conditions, we can count the valid numbers as follows:
  - The last digit must be 5 (since the number must be divisible by 5).
  - The remaining three digits must be even.
  The possible values for each digit are 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 (even digits). Therefore, there are 5 choices for each of the three remaining digits.
  Thus, the total number of valid 4-digit numbers is:
  \[ 5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125 \]
  However, we need to consider the range of numbers from 1000 to 9999. The smallest number in this range that satisfies the conditions is 1000, and the largest is 9999. Therefore, the total number of valid numbers is:
  \[ 9999 - 1000 + 1 = 9000 \]
  However, since we need to count only those numbers that are divisible by 5 and have only even digits, we need to filter out the numbers that are not divisible by 5 or have non-even digits. This filtering is done using the `Finset.filter` function.
  Finally, we need to count the number of elements in the filtered set, which is given by `Finset.card`.
