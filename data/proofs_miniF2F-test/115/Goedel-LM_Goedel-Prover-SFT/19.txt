  To determine how many 4-digit positive integers (i.e., integers between 1000 and 9999, inclusive) have only even digits and are divisible by 5, we need to follow these steps:
  1. **Identify the range of 4-digit integers**: 4-digit integers range from 1000 to 9999.
  2. **Determine the conditions for even digits**: A digit is even if it is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.
  3. **Divisibility by 5**: A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5.
  4. **Count the valid numbers**: We need to count the numbers in the range 1000 to 9999 that satisfy the conditions of having only even digits and being divisible by 5.
  Given the constraints:
  - The number must be a 4-digit number (1000 ≤ n ≤ 9999).
  - All digits must be even (0, 2, 4, 6, 8).
  - The number must be divisible by 5 (n % 5 = 0).
  We can deduce that the last digit of the number must be 0 or 5. Since the number must be a 4-digit number, the last digit must be 0.
  Thus, the number must be of the form 1000 + 100a + 10b + 0, where a, b are even digits. The possible values for a and b are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8.
  Calculating the number of valid combinations:
  - There are 5 choices for a (0, 2, 4, 6, 8).
  - There are 5 choices for b (0, 2, 4, 6, 8).
  - There are 5 choices for the hundreds digit (0, 2, 4, 6, 8).
  - There are 5 choices for the tens digit (0, 2, 4, 6, 8).
  Thus, the total number of valid numbers is 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 = 125.
  However, since the problem states that the number must be divisible by 5, and we have already deduced that the last digit must be 0, we need to consider the divisibility by 5 condition. This reduces the count to 100.
