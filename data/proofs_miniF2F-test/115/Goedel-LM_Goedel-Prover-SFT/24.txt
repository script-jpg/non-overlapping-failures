  To determine how many 4-digit positive integers have only even digits and are divisible by 5, we need to count the numbers in the range from 1000 to 9999 that satisfy the given conditions.
  1. **Range and Conditions**: We are interested in numbers \( n \) such that \( 1000 \leq n \leq 9999 \).
  2. **Even Digits**: Each digit of \( n \) must be even.
  3. **Divisibility by 5**: The number must be divisible by 5.
  Given these conditions, we can use the fact that the last digit of a number determines its divisibility by 5. Since we are only interested in even digits, the last digit must be 0 or 2.
  To count the numbers, we can consider the structure of the numbers and the constraints on the digits. Since the first digit (thousands place) is fixed at 1 or 9, and the last digit must be 0 or 2, we can systematically count the valid numbers.

    -- We need to show that n satisfies the conditions if and only if it is in S.
    -- This involves checking the range, even digits, and divisibility by 5.
    -- We use the fact that the last digit of a number determines its divisibility by 5.
    -- Since we are only interested in even digits, the last digit must be 0 or 2.
    -- We can systematically count the valid numbers.

  -- We rewrite S using the filter function to include only numbers divisible by 5.
