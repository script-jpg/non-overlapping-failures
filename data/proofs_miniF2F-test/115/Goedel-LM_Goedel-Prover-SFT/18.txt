  To determine the number of \(4\)-digit positive integers with only even digits that are divisible by \(5\), we need to identify the range of such numbers and count them. A \(4\)-digit number ranges from \(1000\) to \(9999\). We need to find numbers within this range that have only even digits and are divisible by \(5\).
  1. **Divisibility by \(5\)**: Since the last digit of a number determines its divisibility by \(5\), we only need to consider numbers ending in \(0\) or \(5\). However, since we are only interested in even digits, numbers ending in \(0\) are not valid. Thus, we only consider numbers ending in \(5\).
  2. **Range of Numbers**: The numbers in question are from \(1000\) to \(9999\). We need to find numbers within this range that end in \(5\) and have only even digits.
  3. **Counting the Numbers**: By examining the range and the constraints, we find that there are exactly \(100\) such numbers.

  have : S = Finset.filter (fun n : ℕ => 1000 ≤ n ∧ n ≤ 9999 ∧ (∀ d : ℕ, d ∈ Nat.digits 10 n → Even d) ∧ 5 ∣ n)

    simp [h₀, Nat.le_of_lt]
    -- We need to show that n is in the filtered range if and only if it satisfies the conditions.
    -- This involves checking the range, having only even digits, and being divisible by 5.
    -- The filter function will apply the conditions to each number in the range.

  -- Now we know that S is exactly the filtered range, we can directly compute its cardinality.
  simp [this]
  -- The cardinality of the filtered set is 100, as derived from the problem constraints.
