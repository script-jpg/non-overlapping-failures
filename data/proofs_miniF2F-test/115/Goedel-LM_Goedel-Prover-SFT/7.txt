  To determine how many 4-digit positive integers have only even digits, we need to count the numbers between 1000 and 9999 that have only even digits. The even digits are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8. We will filter the numbers based on the condition that all their digits are even and divisible by 5.
  1. **Filtering the Set**: We filter the numbers from 1000 to 9999, keeping only those that have only even digits and are divisible by 5.
  2. **Counting the Elements**: We count the number of elements in the filtered set.
  Given the constraints, we can manually count the numbers that meet the criteria. The numbers between 1000 and 9999 with only even digits are 1000, 1002, 1004,..., 9998. This sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a = 1000\) and the common difference \(d = 2\). The number of terms in this sequence can be found by solving for \(n\) in the equation:
  \[ 1000 + (n-1) \cdot 2 = 9998 \]
  \[ 2n = 9000 \]
  \[ n = 4500 \]
  However, we need to consider only those numbers that are divisible by 5. Since every number divisible by 5 ends in 0 or 5, we filter out the numbers ending in 0 or 5 from the sequence. The numbers ending in 0 are 1000, 1002, 1004,..., 9990, and the numbers ending in 5 are 1005, 1007, 1009,..., 9995. This sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a = 1000\) and the common difference \(d = 2\). The number of terms in this sequence is:
  \[ 1000 + (n-1) \cdot 2 = 9999 \]
  \[ 2n = 9000 \]
  \[ n = 4500 \]
  Thus, the number of 4-digit numbers with only even digits is 100.
