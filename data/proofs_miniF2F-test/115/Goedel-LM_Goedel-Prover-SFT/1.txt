  To determine how many 4-digit positive integers (i.e., integers between 1000 and 9999, inclusive) have only even digits and are divisible by 5, we need to follow these steps:
  1. **Identify the range of 4-digit numbers**: 4-digit numbers are between 1000 and 9999.
  2. **Determine which numbers in this range have only even digits**: We need to check each number in the range to see if all its digits are even.
  3. **Filter out numbers divisible by 5**: Since the last digit of a number determines its divisibility by 5, we only need to consider numbers where the last digit is 0 or 5.
  4. **Count the valid numbers**: After filtering, we count the numbers that meet the criteria.
  Given the constraints, we can use the fact that the last digit of a number determines its divisibility by 5, and since the digits must be even, we can focus on the last digit being 0 or 5. This reduces the problem to counting the numbers in the range 1000 to 9999 that meet the criteria.
