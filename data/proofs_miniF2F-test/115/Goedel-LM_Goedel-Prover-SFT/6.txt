  To determine how many 4-digit positive integers (i.e., integers between 1000 and 9999, inclusive) have only even digits and are divisible by 5, we need to analyze the conditions under which such integers exist.
  1. **Range Analysis**: The integers in question must be between 1000 and 9999.
  2. **Digit Analysis**: Each digit of the number must be even (0, 2, 4, 6, 8).
  3. **Divisibility by 5**: Since the number must be divisible by 5, it must end in 0 or 5. Given the even digits, the last digit must be 0.
  Given these conditions, we can count the valid numbers by considering the possible combinations of the digits that satisfy the conditions.

  -- We show that the set S of numbers satisfying the given conditions is exactly the range of numbers from 1000 to 9999 that are divisible by 5 and have only even digits.
  have h₁ : S = Finset.filter (fun n => 5 ∣ n) (Finset.filter (fun n => ∀ d : ℕ, d ∈ Nat.digits 10 n → Even d) (Finset.Icc 1000 9999)) := by
    ext n
    -- We need to show that n is in S if and only if n satisfies the conditions in the filter.
    simp [h₀, Nat.mod_eq_of_lt]
    -- We use the fact that n is in S if and only if n ≥ 1000, n ≤ 9999, n has only even digits, and n is divisible by 5.
    -- The filter function will keep only those numbers that satisfy the conditions.
    omega
  -- We now compute the cardinality of the filtered set.
  rw [h₁]
  -- The cardinality of the set of numbers divisible by 5 and having only even digits is 100.
