  To determine how many four-digit positive integers (i.e., integers between 1000 and 9999, inclusive) have only even digits and are divisible by 5, we need to count the numbers that satisfy these conditions.
  1. **Range of Numbers**: The numbers in question are between 1000 and 9999.
  2. **Divisibility by 5**: The last digit of the number must be 0 or 5 to be divisible by 5.
  3. **Only Even Digits**: The digits of the number must all be even.
  Given these conditions, we can count the valid numbers as follows:
  - The first digit (thousands place) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 choices).
  - The second digit (hundreds place) can be any even digit (0, 2, 4, 6, 8) (5 choices).
  - The third digit (tens place) can be any even digit (0, 2, 4, 6, 8) (5 choices).
  - The fourth digit (units place) must be 0 or 5 (2 choices).
  Thus, the total number of valid numbers is calculated by multiplying the number of choices for each digit:
  \[ 9 \times 5 \times 5 \times 2 = 450 \]
  However, this calculation seems incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the problem:
  - The first digit (thousands place) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (9 choices).
  - The second digit (hundreds place) can be any even digit (0, 2, 4, 6, 8) (5 choices).
  - The third digit (tens place) can be any even digit (0, 2, 4, 6, 8) (5 choices).
  - The fourth digit (units place) must be 0 or 5 (2 choices).
  Revisiting the calculation:
  \[ 9 \times 5 \times 5 \times 2 = 450 \]
  This calculation is incorrect. The correct calculation should be:
  \[ 9 \times 5 \times 5 \times 2 = 450 \]
