  To determine how many 4-digit positive integers have only even digits and are divisible by 5, we start by defining the set \( S \) of such integers. We then prove that \( S \) is equivalent to the set of integers \( n \) in the range from 1000 to 9999, where each digit is even and \( n \) is divisible by 5. Finally, we count the number of such integers and verify that the count is 100.

  -- We rewrite S using the filter equivalence.

  -- We compute the cardinality of the filtered set, which is known to be 100.
