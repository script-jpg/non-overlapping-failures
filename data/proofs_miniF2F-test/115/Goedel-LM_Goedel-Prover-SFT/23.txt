  To determine how many 4-digit positive integers (i.e., integers between 1000 and 9999, inclusive) have only even digits and are divisible by 5, we need to follow these steps:
  1. **Identify the range of 4-digit numbers**: These numbers range from 1000 to 9999.
  2. **Determine which numbers in this range are divisible by 5**: Since the last digit of a number determines its divisibility by 5, we need to check the last digit of each number in the range.
  3. **Count the numbers with only even digits**: We need to count the numbers in the range that meet the criteria: the last digit is even and the number is divisible by 5.
  Given the constraints:
  - The number must be a 4-digit number (1000 ≤ n ≤ 9999).
  - The last digit must be even (d ∈ Nat.digits 10 n → Even d).
  - The number must be divisible by 5 (5 ∣ n).
  We can deduce that the number of such numbers is 100, as the range of 4-digit numbers is from 1000 to 9999, and the number of valid numbers is 100.
