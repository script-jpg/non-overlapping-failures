  To determine the number of 4-digit positive integers with only even digits that are divisible by 5, we need to count the integers in the range from 1000 to 9999 that satisfy the conditions:
  1. All digits are even.
  2. The number is divisible by 5.
  Since the last digit of a number determines its divisibility by 5, we can focus on the last digit being even and less than 10. The possible even digits are 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8.
  Given that the first three digits must also be even, we can list the possible combinations of these digits:
  - The first digit can be 2, 4, 6, or 8.
  - The second digit can be 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.
  - The third digit can be 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.
  - The fourth digit can be 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.
  For each combination of the first three digits, there are 5 possible values for the fourth digit. Therefore, the total number of valid 4-digit numbers is calculated by multiplying the number of choices for each digit:
  \[ 4 \text{ (choices for the first digit)} \times 5 \text{ (choices for the second digit)} \times 5 \text{ (choices for the third digit)} \times 5 \text{ (choices for the fourth digit)} = 5^4 = 625 \]
  However, we need to exclude the numbers that start with 0, as they are not valid 4-digit numbers. The numbers that start with 0 are of the form 0xxxx, which are not valid. Therefore, we need to exclude 0 from the count.
  The final count of valid 4-digit numbers is:
  \[ 625 - 1 = 624 \]
  Thus, the number of 4-digit positive integers with only even digits that are divisible by 5 is 100.
