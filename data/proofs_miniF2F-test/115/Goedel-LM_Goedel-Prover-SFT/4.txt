  To determine how many $4$-digit positive integers (i.e., integers between $1000$ and $9999$, inclusive) have only even digits and are divisible by $5$, we need to count the numbers that satisfy these conditions.
  1. **Range of Numbers**: The numbers range from $1000$ to $9999$.
  2. **Even Digits**: Each digit of the number must be even.
  3. **Divisibility by 5**: The number must be divisible by $5$.
  Given these conditions, we can use the properties of even digits and divisibility to count the numbers.

  have h₁ : S = Finset.filter (fun n : ℕ => 1000 ≤ n ∧ n ≤ 9999 ∧ (∀ d : ℕ, d ∈ Nat.digits 10 n → Even d) ∧ 5 ∣ n)
    (Finset.range 10000) := by
    ext n
    simp [h₀]
    -- We need to show that n satisfies the conditions if and only if it is in the range [1000, 9999] and satisfies the given conditions.
    -- This is done by simplifying the conditions using logical equivalences and the properties of numbers.

  rw [h₁]
  -- Now we rewrite S using the filter function to count the numbers that satisfy the conditions.
