  To determine how many 4-digit positive integers (i.e., integers between 1000 and 9999, inclusive) have only even digits and are divisible by 5, we need to analyze the conditions under which a number is divisible by 5. Since the last digit of a number determines its divisibility by 5, we focus on the last digit being even.
  Given that the last digit of any number is one of the digits from 0 to 9, and we are looking for numbers with only even digits, the possible last digits are 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8. For each of these, there are 9 choices for the hundreds, tens, and units place digits (since they must be even).
  Thus, the total number of such numbers is calculated by multiplying the number of choices for each place by the number of choices for the last digit:
  \[ 5 \text{ (choices for the last digit)} \times 9 \text{ (choices for the hundreds place)} \times 9 \text{ (choices for the tens place)} \times 9 \text{ (choices for the units place)} = 3240 \]
  However, this calculation seems incorrect based on the given problem statement. Let's correct it by considering the correct number of choices for the last digit and the other places.
