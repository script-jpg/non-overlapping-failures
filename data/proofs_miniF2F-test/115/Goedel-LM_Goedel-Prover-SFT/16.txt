  To determine the number of 4-digit positive integers with only even digits that are divisible by 5, we need to find the range of such integers and count them. A 4-digit number ranges from 1000 to 9999. We need to find numbers that satisfy the conditions:
  1. All digits are even.
  2. The number is divisible by 5.
  Since the last digit must be 5 (to ensure divisibility by 5), we focus on the first three digits. Each digit can be one of 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 (since 0 is not allowed as the first digit). This gives us a total of \(5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125\) numbers. However, we need to exclude numbers that start with 0, as they are not valid 4-digit numbers.
  The numbers that start with 0 are:
  - 0005, 0025, 0045, 0065, 0085
  - 0205, 0225, 0245, 0265, 0285
  - 0405, 0425, 0445, 0465, 0485
  - 0605, 0625, 0645, 0665, 0685
  - 0805, 0825, 0845, 0865, 0885
  There are 5 such numbers. Therefore, the number of valid 4-digit numbers is \(125 - 5 = 120\).

    -- We need to show that the set S is equal to the filtered set of numbers that satisfy the given conditions.
    -- This involves checking that each number in S meets the criteria and vice versa.
    -- The criteria are:
    -- 1. The number is a 4-digit number (1000 ≤ n ≤ 9999).
    -- 2. All digits are even.
    -- 3. The number is divisible by 5.
    -- We will use the `omega` tactic to solve the arithmetic and logical constraints.
