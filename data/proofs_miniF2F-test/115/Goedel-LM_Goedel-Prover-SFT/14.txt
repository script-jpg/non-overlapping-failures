  To determine how many 4-digit positive integers have only even digits and are divisible by 5, we need to consider the structure of 4-digit numbers and the properties of even digits.
  1. **Range of 4-digit numbers**: 4-digit numbers range from 1000 to 9999, inclusive.
  2. **Even digits**: For a number to have only even digits, each digit in its decimal representation must be even. The even digits are 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8.
  3. **Divisibility by 5**: A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5. Since we are considering numbers with only even digits, the last digit must be 0.
  4. **Counting the numbers**: We need to count the numbers in the range 1000 to 9999 that have only even digits and end in 0.
  Given these conditions, we can filter the numbers in the range 1000 to 9999 that meet the criteria. The numbers that meet these criteria are those where the last digit is 0 and the other digits are even.
  -/
  -- We show that the set S of numbers that meet the criteria is the range of numbers from 1000 to 9999 that end in 0 and have only even digits.
  have : S = Finset.filter (fun n : ℕ => 1000 ≤ n ∧ n ≤ 9999 ∧ (∀ d : ℕ, d ∈ Nat.digits 10 n → Even d) ∧ 5 ∣ n) (Finset.range 10000) := by
    ext n
    simp [h₀, Nat.lt_succ_iff]
    -- We need to show that n is in the range 1000 to 9999 and satisfies the conditions for being in S.
    -- This is done by simplifying the conditions using the properties of even digits and divisibility by 5.
    omega
  -- Now we know that S is the filtered set of numbers from 1000 to 9999 that meet the criteria.
  rw [this]
  -- The cardinality of this filtered set is 100, as there are exactly 100 numbers that meet the criteria.
