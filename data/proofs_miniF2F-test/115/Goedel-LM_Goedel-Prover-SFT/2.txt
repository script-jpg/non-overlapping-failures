  To determine how many 4-digit positive integers have only even digits and are divisible by 5, we need to identify the range of such integers and count them. The integers in question are between 1000 and 9999, inclusive. We will filter these integers by the condition that they have only even digits and are divisible by 5.
  1. **Range Identification**: The integers range from 1000 to 9999.
  2. **Digit Constraint**: Each digit of the integer must be even.
  3. **Divisibility Constraint**: The integer must be divisible by 5.
  Given the constraints, we can deduce that the integers must end in 0 or 5. Since the last digit must be 0 or 5, we only need to consider the digits in the thousands and hundreds place.

    -- We need to show that n is divisible by 5 and has only even digits.
    -- This is equivalent to filtering the set of numbers from 1000 to 9999 based on the given conditions.

  -- The result is that the cardinality of the filtered set is 100.
