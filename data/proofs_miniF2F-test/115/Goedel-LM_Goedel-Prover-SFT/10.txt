  To solve the problem of finding how many 4-digit positive integers have only even digits and are divisible by 5, we need to count the numbers that meet these criteria. We will use the given conditions to filter the numbers and count them directly.
  1. **Filtering the Numbers**: We filter the numbers from 1000 to 9999 that have only even digits and are divisible by 5.
  2. **Counting the Numbers**: We count the numbers that meet the criteria. Given the constraints, we can directly compute the count.

  -- We show that S is the set of numbers that meet the given conditions.
  have : S = Finset.filter (fun n => 1000 ≤ n ∧ n ≤ 9999 ∧ (∀ d : ℕ, d ∈ Nat.digits 10 n → Even d) ∧ 5 ∣ n) (Finset.range 10000) := by
    ext n
    -- We show that n is in S if and only if it satisfies the filter condition.
    simp [Nat.lt_succ_iff, h₀, Nat.lt_succ_iff]
    -- We use the omega tactic to solve the linear arithmetic problem.
    omega
  -- We rewrite S using the filter condition.
  rw [this]
  -- We compute the cardinality of the filtered set.
