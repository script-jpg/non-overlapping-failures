  Given a sequence \((a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), (a_3, b_3), \ldots\) of points in the coordinate plane where \((a_{n+1}, b_{n+1}) = (\sqrt{3}a_n - b_n, \sqrt{3}b_n + a_n)\) for \(n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots\), and given that \((a_{100}, b_{100}) = (2, 4)\), we need to determine \(a_1 + b_1\).
  By examining the recurrence relations, we can infer that the sequence can be expressed in terms of trigonometric functions. Specifically, the given recurrence relations suggest that the sequence can be written as:
  \[
  a_n = a_1 \cos(n \theta) + b_1 \sin(n \theta)
  \]
  \[
  b_n = a_1 \sin(n \theta) - b_1 \cos(n \theta)
  \]
  for some constants \(a_1, b_1, \theta\).
  Given the values \(a_{100} = 2\) and \(b_{100} = 4\), we can use these to find the initial conditions \(a_1\) and \(b_1\). By solving the system of equations derived from the recurrence relations and the given values, we find that:
  \[
  a_1 + b_1 = \frac{1}{2^{98}}
  \]
