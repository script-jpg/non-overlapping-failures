  We need to show that for a sequence of points \((a_n, b_n)\) defined by the recurrence relations \((a_{n+1}, b_{n+1}) = (\sqrt{3}a_n - b_n, \sqrt{3}b_n + a_n)\), if \((a_{100}, b_{100}) = (2, 4)\), then \(a_1 + b_1 = \frac{1}{2^{98}}\).
  Given the initial conditions and the recurrence relations, we can derive the values of \(a_n\) and \(b_n\) for the first few terms. By examining the pattern, we observe that the sequence of \(a_n\) and \(b_n\) grows in a way that allows us to determine the sum \(a_1 + b_1\).
