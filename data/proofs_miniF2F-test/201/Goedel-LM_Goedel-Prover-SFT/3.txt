  Given the sequence \((a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), (a_3, b_3), \ldots\) of points in the coordinate plane where \((a_{n+1}, b_{n+1}) = (\sqrt{3}a_n - b_n, \sqrt{3}b_n + a_n)\) for \(n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots\), and given \((a_{100}, b_{100}) = (2, 4)\), we need to find \(a_1 + b_1\).

  By examining the recurrence relations, we can derive the values of \(a_n\) and \(b_n\) for the first few terms. Using the initial condition \((a_{100}, b_{100}) = (2, 4)\), we can work backwards to find the values of \(a_1\) and \(b_1\).

  After simplifying and solving the system of equations, we find that \(a_1 + b_1 = \frac{1}{2^{98}}\).
