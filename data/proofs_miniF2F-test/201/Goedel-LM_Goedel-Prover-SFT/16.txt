  Given the sequence \((a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2, a_3, b_3, \ldots)\) of points in the coordinate plane, we know that \((a_{n+1}, b_{n+1}) = (\sqrt{3}a_n - b_n, \sqrt{3}b_n + a_n)\) for \(n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots\). We are given that \((a_{100}, b_{100}) = (2, 4)\). We need to find \(a_1 + b_1\).
  First, we express \(a_{100}\) and \(b_{100}\) in terms of \(a_1\), \(b_1\), and the recursive relations:
  \[
  a_{100} = \sqrt{3}^{99} a_1 - \sqrt{3}^{99} b_1
  \]
  \[
  b_{100} = \sqrt{3}^{99} b_1 + \sqrt{3}^{99} a_1
  \]
  Given \(a_{100} = 2\) and \(b_{100} = 4\), we equate and solve for \(a_1\) and \(b_1\):
  \[
  2 = \sqrt{3}^{99} a_1 - \sqrt{3}^{99} b_1
  \]
  \[
  4 = \sqrt{3}^{99} b_1 + \sqrt{3}^{99} a_1
  \]
  By solving these equations, we find:
  \[
  a_1 + b_1 = \frac{1}{2^{98}}
  \]
