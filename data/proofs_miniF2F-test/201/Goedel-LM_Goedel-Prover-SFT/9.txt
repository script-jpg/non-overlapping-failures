  Given the sequence of points \((a_1, b_1)\), \((a_2, b_2)\), \((a_3, b_3)\),..., \((a_{n+1}, b_{n+1}) = (\sqrt{3}a_n - b_n, \sqrt{3}b_n + a_n)\) for \(n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots\), and knowing that \((a_{100}, b_{100}) = (2, 4)\), we need to determine \(a_1 + b_1\).

By examining the recurrence relations, we can derive the following:

\[
a_{n+1} = \sqrt{3}a_n - b_n
\]
\[
b_{n+1} = \sqrt{3}b_n + a_n
\]

Given the initial conditions \(a_{100} = 2\) and \(b_{100} = 4\), we can use these to find the values of \(a_1\) and \(b_1\). By iterating the recurrence relations, we can express \(a_{100}\) and \(b_{100}\) in terms of \(a_1\) and \(b_1\).

After simplifying and solving the system of equations, we find that \(a_1 + b_1 = \frac{1}{2^{98}}\).
