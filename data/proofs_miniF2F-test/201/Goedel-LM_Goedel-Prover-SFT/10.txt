  Given the sequences \( (a_n, b_n) \) defined by the recurrence relations \( a_{n+1} = \sqrt{3} a_n - b_n \) and \( b_{n+1} = \sqrt{3} b_n + a_n \), we need to determine \( a_1 + b_1 \) given that \( (a_{100}, b_{100}) = (2, 4) \).
  To solve this, we will use the recurrence relations to express \( a_{100} \) and \( b_{100} \) in terms of \( a_1 \) and \( b_1 \). By iterating through the recurrence relations, we can derive the values of \( a_1 \) and \( b_1 \).
