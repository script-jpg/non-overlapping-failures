  Given a sequence \((a_1, b_1)\), \((a_2, b_2)\), \((a_3, b_3)\), \(\ldots\) of points in the coordinate plane where each point satisfies the recurrence relation \((a_{n+1}, b_{n+1}) = (\sqrt{3}a_n - b_n, \sqrt{3}b_n + a_n)\) for \(n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots\). Suppose \((a_{100}, b_{100}) = (2, 4)\). We need to find \(a_1 + b_1\).
  By examining the recurrence relations, we can derive specific values for \(a_n\) and \(b_n\) that satisfy the given conditions. By induction or direct computation, we can show that the sequence of points \((a_n, b_n)\) forms a pattern that simplifies the calculation of \(a_1 + b_1\).
  Given the specific values at \(n = 100\), we can use these to find the initial conditions \(a_1\) and \(b_1\). By solving the system of equations derived from the recurrence relations, we find that \(a_1 + b_1 = \frac{1}{2^{98}}\).
