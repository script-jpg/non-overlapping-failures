  Given a sequence \((a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), (a_3, b_3), \ldots\) of points in the coordinate plane that satisfies the recurrence relations:
  \[
  (a_{n+1}, b_{n+1}) = (\sqrt{3}a_n - b_n, \sqrt{3}b_n + a_n)
  \]
  for \(n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots\), and given that \((a_{100}, b_{100}) = (2, 4)\), we need to determine \(a_1 + b_1\).
  To solve this, we observe that the sequence is defined by linear recurrence relations. By iterating through the recurrence relations, we can express \(a_{100}\) and \(b_{100}\) in terms of \(a_1\) and \(b_1\). Using the given values, we can solve for \(a_1\) and \(b_1\) and then sum them to find \(a_1 + b_1\).
