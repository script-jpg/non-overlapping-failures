  Given a sequence \((a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), (a_3, b_3), \ldots\) of points in the coordinate plane that satisfies the recurrence relation \((a_{n+1}, b_{n+1}) = (\sqrt{3}a_n - b_n, \sqrt{3}b_n + a_n)\) for \(n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots\), and given that \((a_{100}, b_{100}) = (2, 4)\), we need to determine \(a_1 + b_1\).
  First, we apply the recurrence relation repeatedly to express \(a_{100}\) and \(b_{100}\) in terms of earlier terms. By induction, we can show that:
  \[ a_{100} = \sqrt{3}^{99} a_1 - \sqrt{3}^{98} b_1 \]
  \[ b_{100} = \sqrt{3}^{99} b_1 + \sqrt{3}^{98} a_1 \]
  Given \(a_{100} = 2\) and \(b_{100} = 4\), we substitute these into the equations:
  \[ 2 = \sqrt{3}^{99} a_1 - \sqrt{3}^{98} b_1 \]
  \[ 4 = \sqrt{3}^{99} b_1 + \sqrt{3}^{98} a_1 \]
  Next, we solve these equations simultaneously to find \(a_1\) and \(b_1\). By manipulating the equations, we can isolate \(a_1\) and \(b_1\) and find their values. Finally, we sum \(a_1\) and \(b_1\) to find \(a_1 + b_1\).
