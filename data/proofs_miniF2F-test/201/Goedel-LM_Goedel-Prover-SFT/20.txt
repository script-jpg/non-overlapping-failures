  Given the sequence of points \((a_1, b_1)\), \((a_2, b_2)\), \((a_3, b_3)\), \(\ldots\) defined by the recurrence relations:
  \[
  (a_{n+1}, b_{n+1}) = (\sqrt{3}a_n - b_n, \sqrt{3}b_n + a_n)
  \]
  for \(n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots\).
  Suppose that \((a_{100}, b_{100}) = (2, 4)\). We need to determine \(a_1 + b_1\).
  By applying the recurrence relations, we can express \(a_{100}\) and \(b_{100}\) in terms of \(a_1\) and \(b_1\). Specifically, we will show that:
  \[
  a_{100} = \sqrt{3}^{99} \cdot a_1 - \sqrt{3}^{99} \cdot b_1
  \]
  \[
  b_{100} = \sqrt{3}^{99} \cdot b_1 + \sqrt{3}^{99} \cdot a_1
  \]
  Given \(a_{100} = 2\) and \(b_{100} = 4\), we can solve for \(a_1\) and \(b_1\) and verify that:
  \[
  a_1 + b_1 = \frac{1}{2^{98}}
  \]
