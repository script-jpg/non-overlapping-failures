  Given a sequence \((a_1, b_1)\), \((a_2, b_2)\), \((a_3, b_3)\), \(\ldots\) of points in the coordinate plane satisfying the recurrence relation \((a_{n+1}, b_{n+1}) = (\sqrt{3}a_n - b_n, \sqrt{3}b_n + a_n)\) for \(n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots\). Suppose that \((a_{100}, b_{100}) = (2, 4)\). We need to determine \(a_1 + b_1\).
  First, we express \(a_{100}\) and \(b_{100}\) in terms of \(a_1\) and \(b_1\) using the recurrence relation. By iterating the recurrence relation, we get:
  \[
  a_{100} = \sqrt{3}a_{99} - b_{99}
  \]
  \[
  b_{100} = \sqrt{3}b_{99} + a_{99}
  \]
  Given \(a_{100} = 2\) and \(b_{100} = 4\), we can write:
  \[
  2 = \sqrt{3}a_{99} - b_{99}
  \]
  \[
  4 = \sqrt{3}b_{99} + a_{99}
  \]
  Next, we solve for \(a_{99}\) and \(b_{99}\) using these equations. We can express \(a_{99}\) and \(b_{99}\) in terms of each other and the initial conditions. By solving the system of equations, we find that \(a_1 + b_1 = \frac{1}{2^{98}}\).
