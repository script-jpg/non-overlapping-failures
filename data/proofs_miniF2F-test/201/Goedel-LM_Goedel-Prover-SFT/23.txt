  Given a sequence \((a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), (a_3, b_3), \ldots\) of points in the coordinate plane that satisfies the recurrence relation \((a_{n+1}, b_{n+1}) = (\sqrt{3}a_n - b_n, \sqrt{3}b_n + a_n)\) for \(n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots\), and given that \((a_{100}, b_{100}) = (2, 4)\), we need to determine \(a_1 + b_1\).

  To solve this, we start by examining the recurrence relations and the given values. We can use the recurrence relations to express \(a_{100}\) and \(b_{100}\) in terms of earlier terms. By iterating the recurrence relations, we can derive expressions for \(a_{100}\) and \(b_{100}\) in terms of \(a_1\) and \(b_1\).

  Given:
  \[
  (a_{n+1}, b_{n+1}) = (\sqrt{3}a_n - b_n, \sqrt{3}b_n + a_n)
  \]
  We can write:
  \[
  a_{100} = \sqrt{3}a_{99} - b_{99}
  \]
  \[
  b_{100} = \sqrt{3}b_{99} + a_{99}
  \]
  Given \(a_{100} = 2\) and \(b_{100} = 4\), we can solve for \(a_{99}\) and \(b_{99}\):
  \[
  2 = \sqrt{3}a_{99} - b_{99}
  \]
  \[
  4 = \sqrt{3}b_{99} + a_{99}
  \]
  By solving these equations simultaneously, we can find the values of \(a_{99}\) and \(b_{99}\). Continuing this process, we find that \(a_1 + b_1 = \frac{1}{2^{98}}\).
