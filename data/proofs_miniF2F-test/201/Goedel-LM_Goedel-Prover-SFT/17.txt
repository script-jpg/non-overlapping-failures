  Given the sequence \((a_n, b_n)\) defined by the recurrence relations \((a_{n+1}, b_{n+1}) = (\sqrt{3}a_n - b_n, \sqrt{3}b_n + a_n)\) for \(n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots\), and knowing that \((a_{100}, b_{100}) = (2, 4)\), we need to find \(a_1 + b_1\).
  First, we normalize the given values using numerical simplification. Then, we use the recurrence relations to express \(a_{100}\) and \(b_{100}\) in terms of previous terms. By iterating through the recurrence relations, we can derive the values of \(a_1\) and \(b_1\). Finally, we sum these values to obtain the result.
