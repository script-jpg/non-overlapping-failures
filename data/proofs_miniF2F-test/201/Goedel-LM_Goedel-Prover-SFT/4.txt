  Given a sequence \((a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), (a_3, b_3), \ldots\) of points in the coordinate plane, we know that \((a_{n+1}, b_{n+1}) = (\sqrt{3}a_n - b_n, \sqrt{3}b_n + a_n)\) for \(n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots\). Suppose that \((a_{100}, b_{100}) = (2, 4)\). We need to find \(a_1 + b_1\).
  By examining the recurrence relations, we can derive the values of \(a_1\) and \(b_1\) using the given initial condition and the recurrence relations. Specifically, we can use the recurrence relations to express \(a_{100}\) and \(b_{100}\) in terms of \(a_1\) and \(b_1\). Given \(a_{100} = 2\) and \(b_{100} = 4\), we can solve for \(a_1\) and \(b_1\) and then sum them to find \(a_1 + b_1\).
