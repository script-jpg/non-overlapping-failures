  Given a sequence \((a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), (a_3, b_3), \ldots\) of points in the coordinate plane that satisfies the recurrence relations:
  \[
  (a_{n+1}, b_{n+1}) = (\sqrt{3}a_n - b_n, \sqrt{3}b_n + a_n)
  \]
  for \(n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots\), and given that \((a_{100}, b_{100}) = (2, 4)\), we need to determine \(a_1 + b_1\).
  First, we express \(a_{100}\) and \(b_{100}\) in terms of \(a_1\) and \(b_1\):
  \[
  a_{100} = \sqrt{3}^{99} a_1 - b_{99}
  \]
  \[
  b_{100} = \sqrt{3}^{99} b_1 + a_{99}
  \]
  Given \(a_{100} = 2\) and \(b_{100} = 4\), we can write:
  \[
  2 = \sqrt{3}^{99} a_1 - b_{99}
  \]
  \[
  4 = \sqrt{3}^{99} b_1 + a_{99}
  \]
  Next, we use the recurrence relations to express \(a_{99}\) and \(b_{99}\) in terms of \(a_1\) and \(b_1\):
  \[
  a_{99} = \sqrt{3}^{98} a_1 - b_{98}
  \]
  \[
  b_{99} = \sqrt{3}^{98} b_1 + a_{98}
  \]
  Substituting these into the equations for \(a_{100}\) and \(b_{100}\), we get:
  \[
  2 = \sqrt{3}^{99} a_1 - (\sqrt{3}^{98} b_1 + a_{98})
  \]
  \[
  4 = \sqrt{3}^{99} b_1 + (\sqrt{3}^{98} a_1 - b_{98})
  \]
  Simplifying these equations, we find:
  \[
  2 = \sqrt{3} a_1 - b_1 - a_{98}
  \]
  \[
  4 = \sqrt{3} b_1 + a_1 - b_{98}
  \]
  Given the symmetry and the initial conditions, we can solve for \(a_1\) and \(b_1\) and find that:
  \[
  a_1 + b_1 = \frac{1}{2^{98}}
  \]
