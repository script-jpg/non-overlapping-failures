  Given the sequence \((a_1, b_1)\), \((a_2, b_2)\), \((a_3, b_3)\), \(\ldots\) of points in the coordinate plane, we know that for \(n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots\), \((a_{n+1}, b_{n+1}) = (\sqrt{3}a_n - b_n, \sqrt{3}b_n + a_n)\). Suppose \((a_{100}, b_{100}) = (2, 4)\). We need to find \(a_1 + b_1\).
  To solve this, we start by examining the recurrence relations. Given the coordinates, we can derive the following equations:
  \[
  a_{n+1} = \sqrt{3}a_n - b_n
  \]
  \[
  b_{n+1} = \sqrt{3}b_n + a_n
  \]
  We can use these equations to find the initial values \(a_1\) and \(b_1\). By substituting \(n = 1\) into the equations and solving, we can determine \(a_1 + b_1\).
