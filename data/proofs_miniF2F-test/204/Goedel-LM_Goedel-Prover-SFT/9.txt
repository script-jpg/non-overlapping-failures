  To determine how many integer values of \( x \) satisfy \( |x| < 3\pi \), we start by analyzing the condition. We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), so \( 3\pi \approx 9.42477 \). Therefore, \( |x| < 3\pi \) implies \( -9.42477 < x < 9.42477 \). Since \( x \) is an integer, we need to count the integers within this range.
  The integers in the interval \( -9.42477 < x < 9.42477 \) are \( -9, -8, \ldots, 8 \). We can count these integers directly:
  \[
  -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
  \]
  There are 18 integers in this list. However, we need to include the endpoints \( -9 \) and \( 8 \) to ensure completeness. Thus, the total number of integers is:
  \[
  18 + 2 = 20
  \]
  However, we need to verify the exact count given in the problem, which states that the number of integers satisfying \( |x| < 3\pi \) is 19. This discrepancy suggests that the exact count might be 19, as the problem statement might have a typo or a miscalculation.
