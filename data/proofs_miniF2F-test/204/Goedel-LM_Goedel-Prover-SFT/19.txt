  To determine the number of integer values of \( x \) that satisfy \( |x| < 3\pi \), we start by analyzing the inequality. Given that \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), we have \( 3\pi \approx 9.42477 \). Therefore, \( |x| < 9.42477 \). This implies that \( -9.42477 < x < 9.42477 \). Since \( x \) is an integer, we need to count the number of integers within this range.
  The integers in the range \( -9.42477 < x < 9.42477 \) are \( -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 \). There are 19 such integers.
  Thus, the number of integer values of \( x \) that satisfy \( |x| < 3\pi \) is \( \boxed{19} \).
