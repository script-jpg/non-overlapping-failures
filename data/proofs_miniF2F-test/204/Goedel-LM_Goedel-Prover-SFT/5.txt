  To determine how many integer values of \( x \) satisfy \( |x| < 3\pi \), we start by analyzing the inequality. Given that \( \pi \) is approximately 3.14159, we can simplify the inequality \( |x| < 3\pi \) to \( |x| < 9.42477 \). This implies that \( x \) must be an integer such that \( -9.42477 < x < 9.42477 \). The integer values of \( x \) within this range are \( -9, -8, \ldots, 8 \).
  Next, we count the number of such integers. The integers from \( -9 \) to \( 8 \) are \( -9, -8, -7, \ldots, 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 8 \). The number of integers in this sequence is calculated as follows:
  \[
  8 - (-9) + 1 = 8 + 9 + 1 = 18
  \]
  However, we need to include the integer 0 to ensure the range includes all integers from \( -9 \) to \( 8 \). Thus, the total number of integers is:
  \[
  18 + 1 = 19
  \]
