  To determine the number of integer values \( x \) that satisfy \( |x| < 3\pi \), we start by analyzing the given inequality. The absolute value inequality \( |x| < 3\pi \) can be split into two separate inequalities:
  \[ -3\pi < x < 3\pi \]
  Next, we convert these inequalities into integer form. Since \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), we have:
  \[ -9.42477 < x < 9.42477 \]
  The integers within this range are those that satisfy \( -9.42477 < x < 9.42477 \). The integers in this range are:
  \[ -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 \]
  Counting these integers, we find there are 19 integers in total. Therefore, the number of integer values \( x \) that satisfy \( |x| < 3\pi \) is 19.
