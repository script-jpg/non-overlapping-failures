  To determine how many integer values of \( x \) satisfy \( |x| < 3\pi \), we need to identify the range of integers \( x \) such that \( |x| < 3\pi \). The absolute value inequality \( |x| < 3\pi \) translates to \( -3\pi < x < 3\pi \). Since \( \pi \) is approximately 3.14, this simplifies to \( -9.42 < x < 9.42 \). Therefore, the integers \( x \) that satisfy this inequality are those in the interval \( -9.42 < x < 9.42 \).
  The integers in this interval are \( -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 \). Counting these integers, we find there are 19 integers in total.

  -- Now we know S is the set of integers from -9 to 9, we can directly compute its cardinality.
