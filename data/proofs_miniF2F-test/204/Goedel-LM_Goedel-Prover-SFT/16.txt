  To determine the number of integer values of \( x \) that satisfy \( |x| < 3\pi \), we need to find the range of \( x \) such that \( |x| < 3\pi \). This translates to \( -3\pi < x < 3\pi \). We then count the number of integers within this range.
  1. Calculate \( 3\pi \):
     \[
     3\pi \approx 9.424
     \]
     Thus, \( -3\pi \approx -9.424 \).
  2. Determine the range of integers:
     \[
     -9.424 < x < 9.424
     \]
     Since \( x \) must be an integer, the possible values of \( x \) range from \(-9\) to \( 9 \).
  3. Count the integers in the range:
     \[
     -9, -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
     \]
     There are 19 integers in this range.
  Therefore, the number of integer values of \( x \) that satisfy \( |x| < 3\pi \) is 19.
