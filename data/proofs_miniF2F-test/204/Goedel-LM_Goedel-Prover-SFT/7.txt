  To determine how many integer values of \( x \) satisfy \( |x| < 3\pi \), we need to identify the range of integers \( x \) for which \( |x| \) is less than \( 3\pi \). The absolute value \( |x| \) is a non-negative number, and \( 3\pi \) is approximately 9.424. Therefore, \( |x| \) must be less than 9.424.
  The integers are \( -8, -7, -6, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 \). Counting these integers, we find there are 19 integers in total.
