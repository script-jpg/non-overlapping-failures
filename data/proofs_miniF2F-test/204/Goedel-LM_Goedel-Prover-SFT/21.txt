  To show that the number of integer values of \( x \) satisfying \( |x| < 3\pi \) is 19, we start by defining the set \( S \) of integers \( x \) such that \( |x| < 3\pi \). We then prove that this set \( S \) is equivalent to the interval \([-9, 9]\). Finally, we count the number of integers in this interval, which is 19.
