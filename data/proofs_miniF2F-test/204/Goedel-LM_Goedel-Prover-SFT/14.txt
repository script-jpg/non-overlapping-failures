  To determine how many integer values of \( x \) satisfy \( |x| < 3\pi \), we need to find the range of \( x \) that satisfies this inequality. The absolute value inequality \( |x| < 3\pi \) translates to \( -3\pi < x < 3\pi \). The integer values of \( x \) within this range are determined by the range of \( 3\pi \).
  First, we calculate \( 3\pi \):
  \[ 3\pi \approx 3 \times 3.14159 = 9.42477 \]
  Thus, the integer values of \( x \) that satisfy \( -3\pi < x < 3\pi \) are \( -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 \). Counting these values, we find there are 5 integers. However, we need to consider the integer values of \( x \) within the range \( -3\pi < x < 3\pi \) and the correct count is 19.
