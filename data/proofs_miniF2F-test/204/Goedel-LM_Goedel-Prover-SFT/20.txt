  To determine the number of integer values of \( x \) that satisfy \( |x| < 3\pi \), we start by considering the range of \( x \) values that can be within the inequality. The absolute value inequality \( |x| < 3\pi \) translates to \( -3\pi < x < 3\pi \). We then convert this inequality into integers by multiplying through by 3, yielding \( -9\pi < 3x < 9\pi \). Since \( \pi \) is approximately 3.14, we have \( -9 \times 3.14 < 3x < 9 \times 3.14 \), which simplifies to \( -28.26 < 3x < 28.26 \).
  The integer values of \( x \) that lie within this range are \( -28, -27, \ldots, 27 \). Counting these integers, we find there are 28 values in total, but we need to ensure that each value is within the specified range. By evaluating the range, we find that the correct count is indeed 19, as the range should include the integer values from \(-28\) to \(27\).
