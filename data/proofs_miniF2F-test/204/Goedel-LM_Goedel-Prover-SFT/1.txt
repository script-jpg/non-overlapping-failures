  To determine the number of integer values of \( x \) that satisfy \( |x| < 3\pi \), we start by considering the range of \( x \) values. The inequality \( |x| < 3\pi \) translates to \( -3\pi < x < 3\pi \). We then convert this inequality into a real number context, which is straightforward since \( \pi \) is a real number. The integers within this range can be counted by evaluating the range of integers from \( -2\pi \) to \( 2\pi \), inclusive. This range includes all integers within the range \( -3\pi < x < 3\pi \).
