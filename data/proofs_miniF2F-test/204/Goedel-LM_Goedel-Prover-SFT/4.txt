  To determine the number of integer values of \( x \) that satisfy \( |x| < 3\pi \), we start by analyzing the condition. The absolute value function \( |x| \) is non-negative, and thus \( |x| < 3\pi \) implies \( 0 \leq x < 3\pi \).
  Next, we count the integers within this range. Since \( \pi \approx 3.14 \), we have \( 3\pi \approx 9.42 \). Therefore, the integers \( x \) that satisfy \( 0 \leq x < 9.42 \) are \( 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 9 \).
  Thus, there are 10 integers in this range. Additionally, since \( -3\pi \approx -9.42 \), the integers \( x \) that satisfy \( -9.42 < x < 0 \) are \( -1, -2, \ldots, -9 \).
  Combining these, we get the range \( -9.42 < x < 9.42 \), which includes all integers from \( -9 \) to \( 9 \). Therefore, there are \( 9 - (-9) + 1 = 19 \) integers in this range.
