  To determine how many integer values of \( x \) satisfy \( |x| < 3\pi \), we need to consider the range of \( x \) such that the absolute value of \( x \) is less than \( 3\pi \). The absolute value function \( |x| \) is non-negative, and we know that \( \pi \) is approximately 3.14159. Therefore, \( 3\pi \) is approximately 9.42477. The integers \( x \) that satisfy \( |x| < 9.42477 \) are those within the interval \( -9.42477 < x < 9.42477 \). Since \( x \) must be an integer, the possible values of \( x \) are \( -9, -8, \ldots, 8, 9 \). Counting these integers, we find there are 19 integers in total.

  -- We show that the set S is equal to the interval [-9, 9]
  have : S = Finset.Icc (-9 : ℤ) 9 := by
    apply Finset.ext

    -- We use the given condition to show x is in S if and only if it is in the interval [-9, 9]
    simp only [Finset.mem_Icc, h₀, abs_lt]

    -- If -9 ≤ x ≤ 9, then x is in S

    linarith [Real.pi_pos]
  -- Now we know S is the interval [-9, 9], so its cardinality is 19
