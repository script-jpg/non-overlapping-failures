-- First, we try to understand the problem. We need to count the number of integer values of $x$ satisfying $|x| < 3\pi$.

  -- The first step is to convert the real inequality to an integer inequality. We know that $3\pi \approx 9.42$, so we are looking for integers $x$ where $|x| \leq 9$.

  have h₁ : 3 * Real.pi > 9 := by
    have h₁ : Real.pi > 3 := pi_gt_three
    linarith

  have h₂ : 3 * Real.pi < 10 := by
    have h₂ : Real.pi < 3.15 := Real.pi_lt_315
    linarith

  have h₃ : 3 * Real.pi > 9.4 := by
    have h₃ : Real.pi > 3.14 := Real.pi_gt_314
    linarith

  have h₄ : 3 * Real.pi < 9.5 := by
    have h₄ : Real.pi < 3.15 := Real.pi_lt_315
    linarith

  -- To convert the real inequality to an integer inequality, we need to find the integer part of $3\pi$.

  have h₅ : 3 * Real.pi ≤ 9.4 := by
    linarith

  have h₆ : 3 * Real.pi ≥ 9.4 := by
    linarith

  -- Ah! The integer part of $3\pi$ is 9. Therefore, the inequality $|x| < 3\pi$ is equivalent to $|x| ≤ 9$.

  have h₇ : 3 * Real.pi = 9 := by
    linarith

  -- However, we cannot prove that $3\pi = 9$ directly. We need to work with the properties of the real numbers and integers.

  -- We will use the fact that for any real number $r$, if $n$ is an integer, then $r < n + 1$ implies $⌊r⌋ < n$.

  -- First, we prove that $3\pi < 10$.

  -- ```tactics
  -- have h₃ : 3 * Real.pi < 10 := by
  --   have h₃ : Real.pi < 3.15 := Real.pi_lt_315
  --   linarith
  -- ```

  -- We need to convert this real inequality to an integer inequality. The integer part of $3\pi$ is 9, so $3\pi < 10$ implies that the integer values of $x$ satisfying $|x| < 3\pi$ are exactly the integers from $-9$ to $9$, inclusive.

  -- There are 19 integers in this range: 9 positive integers, 9 negative integers, and 0.

  have h₈ : 3 * Real.pi ≤ 9 := by
    linarith

  -- Now, we can use the fact that for any integer $x$, $|x| < 3\pi$ if and only if $-3\pi < x < 3\pi$.

  -- Since $3\pi$ is not an integer, the integer values satisfying $|x| < 3\pi$ are exactly the integers from $-9$ to $9$, inclusive.

  -- There are 19 integers in this range: 9 positive integers, 9 negative integers, and 0.
