-- We want to find the sum of the units digits of all the multiples of $3$ between $0$ and $50$.
  -- The approach is to list the multiples of 3 between 0 and 50, find their units digits, and sum them up.
  -- The multiples of 3 in this range are: 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48.
  -- Their units digits are: 0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8.
  -- Summing these: 0+3+6+9+2+5+8+1+4+7+0+3+6+9+2+5+8 = 78.
