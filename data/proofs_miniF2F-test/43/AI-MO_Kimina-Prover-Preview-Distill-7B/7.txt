-- We need to compute the sum of the units digits of all the multiples of $3$ between $0$ and $50$.
  -- The multiples of $3$ between $0$ and $50$ are $0, 3, 6, \ldots, 48$.
  -- The units digits of these numbers are $0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 0$.
  -- Summing these digits gives $78$.
