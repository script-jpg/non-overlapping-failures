-- We want to calculate the sum of the units digits of all the multiples of $3$ between $0$ and $50$.
  -- That is, we want to calculate the sum of the digits in the ones place of each multiple of $3$ between $0$ and $50$.
  -- We begin by noticing that every third number is a multiple of $3$.
  -- So the multiples of $3$ between $0$ and $50$ are $0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48$.
  -- The units digits of these numbers are $0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8$.
  -- The sum of these digits is $0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 + 1 + 4 + 7 + 0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 = 78$.
