-- We want to show that the sum of the units digits of all the multiples of $3$ between $0$ and $50$ is 78.

  -- Let's first think about which numbers we're dealing with: the multiples of 3 between 0 and 50.
  -- Excluding 0 and 3x10=30, the rest are in the range (0, 50).
  -- The possible remainders when dividing by 10 are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
  -- The remainder of a sum is the sum of the remainders (mod 10).
  -- It is enough to show that the sum of the units digits of all the multiples of 3 between 1 and 49 is 78.

  -- We look at the numbers 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48.
  -- We take their remainders when divided by 10: 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8.
  -- We add them: 3+6+9+2+5+8+1+4+7+0+3+6+9+2+5+8 = 78.

  -- Let's start the proof. We need to import the necessary libraries first.

  -- Now we'll state the theorem. We want to sum the units digits (i.e. take modulo 10) of all multiples of 3 between 0 and 50.

  theorem mathd_numbertheory_447 :
      (∑ k in Finset.filter (fun x => 3 ∣ x) (Finset.Icc 1 49), k % 10) = 78 := by

    -- We're using `Finset.filter` to select the multiples of 3 from the closed interval [1, 49].
    -- Then we take the sum of their remainders when divided by 10.

    -- Let's compute this sum step by step to verify our answer:
    -- The multiples of 3 in this range are: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48.
    -- Their remainders when divided by 10 are: 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8.
    -- Adding these: 3+6+9+2+5+8+1+4+7+0+3+6+9+2+5+8 = 78.

    -- To complete the proof, we simply need to evaluate this sum.
