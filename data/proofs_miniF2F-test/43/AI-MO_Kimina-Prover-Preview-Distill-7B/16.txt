/- We need to find the sum of the units digits of all the multiples of 3 between 0 and 50.
     The units digit of a number is its remainder when divided by 10.
     First, let's identify the multiples of 3 in this range: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48.
     Now, we'll find the units digit of each: 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8. -/
  calc
    (∑ k in Finset.filter (fun x => 3 ∣ x) (Finset.Icc 1 49), k % 10)
      = 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 + 1 + 4 + 7 + 0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 := by rfl
    _ = 78 := by norm_num
