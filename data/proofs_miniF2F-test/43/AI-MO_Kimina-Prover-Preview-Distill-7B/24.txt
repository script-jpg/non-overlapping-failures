-- We want to find the sum of units digits of all multiples of 3 between 0 and 50.
  -- The approach is to consider the units digit of each multiple of 3 in the range, and sum them up.

  -- First, let's identify all the multiples of 3 between 0 and 50:
  -- 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48

  -- Now, let's calculate the sum of their units digits:
  -- 0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 + 1 + 4 + 7 + 0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 = 78

  -- We can use Lean's computational tactics to verify this result.
