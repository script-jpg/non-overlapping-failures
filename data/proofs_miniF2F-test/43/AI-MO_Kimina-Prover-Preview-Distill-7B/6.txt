-- We want to calculate the sum of the units digits of all the multiples of $3$ between $0$ and $50$.
  -- That is, we want to calculate the sum of the digits in the ones place of each multiple of $3$ between $0$ and $50$.
  -- We begin by thinking about which numbers will contribute to this sum. A number will contribute to this sum if it is a multiple of $3$ between $0$ and $50$, and the digit in the ones place of this number is non-zero.
  -- We will calculate this sum by considering each multiple of $3$ between $0$ and $50$ and adding its units digit to our sum if it is non-zero.

  -- Let's start by thinking about how to represent this mathematically. We have a finite set of numbers, and we want to sum over a subset of this set. In Lean, we can represent this as a sum over a finset filtered by a predicate.
  -- We will use `Finset.filter (fun x => 3 ∣ x) (Finset.Icc 1 49)` to represent the set of multiples of $3$ between $1$ and $49$ inclusive. This finset includes all numbers in the range $1$ to $49$ that are divisible by $3$.

  -- Now, to compute the actual sum:
  -- The multiples of $3$ between $0$ and $50$ are: $0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48$.
  -- The units digits of these numbers are: $0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8$.
  -- The non-zero units digits are: $3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8$.
  -- Summing these digits: $3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 + 1 + 4 + 7 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 = 78$.

  -- In Lean, we could compute this sum directly using the `Finset.filter` and `Finset.sum` functions. However, for this specific problem, we can also compute the sum directly by enumeration.
  -- The multiples of $3$ between $0$ and $50$ are $0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48$.
  -- The units digits of these multiples are $0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8$.
  -- The non-zero units digits are $3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8$.
  -- Summing them gives $3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 + 1 + 4 + 7 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 = 78$.

  -- We can complete the proof in Lean with:
  native_decide

  -- The `native_decide` tactic is powerful enough to compute this finite sum directly. It will evaluate the finset, filter the elements divisible by $3$, compute their units digits, and sum them to get $78$.

  -- Therefore, the sum of the units digits of all the multiples of $3$ between $0$ and $50$ is indeed $78$.
</- What is the sum of the units digits of all the multiples of $3$ between $0$ and $50$? Show that it is 78.-/
