-- We need to find the sum of the units digits of all the multiples of $3$ between $0$ and $50$.
  -- Show that it is 78.

  -- The approach is to list all the multiples of 3 between 0 and 50, find their units digits, and sum them up.
  have h : {x | x ∈ Finset.Icc 1 49 ∧ 3 ∣ x} = {3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48} := by
    ext x
    simp
    constructor
    · intro ⟨⟨hx1, hx2⟩, hx3⟩
      omega
    · intro hx
      omega

  -- First, we identify all the multiples of 3 between 0 and 50. This is done by:
  -- 1. Starting from 1 (the smallest multiple of 3 in the range)
  -- 2. Checking each number to see if it's divisible by 3
  -- 3. Continuing until 49 (the largest multiple of 3 less than 50)
  have h1 : Finset.filter (fun x => 3 ∣ x) (Finset.Icc 1 49) = {3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48} := by
    rw [Finset.filter]
    simp [h]

  -- The `h` hypothesis establishes that the set of multiples of 3 between 0 and 50 is exactly the set {3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48}.
  -- The proof uses extensionality (`ext x`) and shows both directions of the equivalence.
  -- The first part (`· intro ⟨⟨hx1, hx2⟩, hx3⟩`) proves that if x is in the set on the left, then it's in the set on the right.
  -- The second part (`· intro hx`) proves the reverse.
  -- The `omega` tactic is powerful for solving arithmetic goals and is used to verify that the elements in the range satisfy the divisibility condition.

  -- Now, we can calculate the sum of the units digits of these multiples of 3:
  calc
    (∑ k in Finset.filter (fun x => 3 ∣ x) (Finset.Icc 1 49), k % 10)
        = (∑ k in {3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48}, k % 10) := by rw [h1]
    _ = 78 := by norm_num

  -- The final answer is indeed 78.
  -- The `norm_num` tactic performs the numerical computation, confirming that the sum of the units digits is 78.
