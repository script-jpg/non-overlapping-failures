-- We want to calculate the sum of the units digits of all the multiples of $3$ between $0$ and $50$.
  -- That is, we want to calculate the sum of the digits in the ones place of each multiple of 3 between 0 and 50.
  -- We first list all the multiples of 3 between 0 and 50.
  -- They are 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48.
  -- Then we pick out the units digits of each multiple of 3.
  -- The units digits are 0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8.
  -- Finally, we calculate the sum of the units digits.
  -- 0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 + 1 + 4 + 7 + 0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 = 78.
  -- Therefore, the sum of the units digits of all the multiples of $3$ between $0$ and $50$ is 78.

  -- We can also use the tactic `rfl` to solve this problem.
