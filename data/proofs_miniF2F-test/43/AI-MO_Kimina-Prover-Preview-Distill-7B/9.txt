-- We need to find the sum of the units digits of all the multiples of $3$ between $0$ and $50$.
  -- That is to say, we need to find the sum of the remainders when divided by $10$ of all the multiples of
  -- $3$ between $0$ and $50$.
  --
  -- Notice that if the last digit unit of an integer $n$ is $0$, $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, $6$, $7$, $8$,
  -- then $n \equiv 0$, $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, $6$, $7$, $8 \pmod{10}$.
  --
  -- Let's list all the multiples of $3$ between $0$ and $50$:
  -- $0$, $3$, $6$, $9$, $12$, $15$, $18$, $21$, $24$, $27$, $30$, $33$, $36$, $39$, $42$, $45$, $48$.
  -- Their unit digits are:
  -- $0$, $3$, $6$, $9$, $2$, $5$, $8$, $1$, $4$, $7$, $0$, $3$, $6$, $9$, $2$, $5$, $8$.
  --
  -- We can see that the unit digits appears in cycle of $10$.
  -- $0+3+6+9+2+5+8+1+4+7 = 45$.
  -- We have two full cycles from $0$ to $9$ and $10$ to $19$.
  -- The sum of the unit digits in two full cycles is $2 \times 45 = 90$.
  -- We then just calculate the sum of the unit digits from $20$ to $49$ and get $78$.
