-- We want to calculate the sum of the units digits of all the multiples of $3$ between $0$ and $50$.
  -- To do this, we first need to identify all the multiples of $3$ between $0$ and $50$.
  -- The multiples of $3$ between $0$ and $50$ are $0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48$.
  -- Now, we need to remove $0$ since we are considering numbers between $0$.
  -- So we have $3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48$.
  -- The units digits of these numbers are $3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8$ respectively.
  -- Summing these digits: $3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 + 1 + 4 + 7 + 0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 = 78$.
