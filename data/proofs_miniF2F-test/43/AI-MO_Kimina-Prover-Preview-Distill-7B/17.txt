-- We want to calculate the sum of the units digits of all the multiples of $3$ between $0$ and $50$.
  -- That is, we want to calculate the sum of the digits in the "one's place" of all the multiples of $3$ between $0$ and $50$.
  -- We first list out all the multiples of $3$ between $0$ and $50$:
  -- $0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48$.
  -- We extract the units digits from these numbers:
  -- $0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8$.
  -- We calculate the sum of these digits:
  -- $0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 + 1 + 4 + 7 + 0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 = 78$.
  -- Therefore, the sum of the units digits of all the multiples of $3$ between $0$ and $50$ is $78$.

  -- We can also formalize this in Lean 1 in the following way:
  -- We use `Finset.filter` to extract the multiples of $3$ from the set of numbers from $1$ to $49$.
  -- Then we use `Finset.sum` to calculate the sum of the units digits (i.e., the remainder divided by $10$) of these multiples of $3$.
  -- We use `Finset.Icc` as the set of numbers from $1$ to $49$.
  -- We use `fun x => 3 ∣ x` to pick out the multiples of $3$.
  -- We use `k % 10` to get the units digit of each multiple of $3$.

  -- The answer is $78$.
