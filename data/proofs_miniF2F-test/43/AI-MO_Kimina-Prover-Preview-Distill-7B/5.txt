-- We want to calculate the sum of the units digits of all the multiples of $3$ between $0$ and $50$.
  -- We first list all multiples of $3$ between $0$ and $50$.
  -- They are $0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48$.
  -- Then we extract their units digits.
  -- They are $0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8$.
  -- The sum of them is $0+3+6+9+2+5+8+1+4+7+0+3+6+9+2+5+8 = 78$.
