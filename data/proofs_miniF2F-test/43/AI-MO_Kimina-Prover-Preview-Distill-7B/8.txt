/- What is the sum of the units digits of all the multiples of $3$ between $0$ and $50$? Show that it is 78.-/
  -- The smallest multiple of 3 in the range is 3 and the largest is 48.
  -- The units digits of the multiples of 3 follow a pattern: 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 0,...
  -- This pattern has a sum of 3+6+9+2+5+8+1+4+7+0 = 45 and length 10.
  -- The sum of the units digits of all the multiples of 3 between 0 and 50 is therefore 45+45+12 = 102.
  -- The sum of the units digits of all the multiples of 3 between 0 and 42 is therefore 45+45 = 90.
  -- The sum of the units digits of all the multiples of 3 between 0 and 36 is therefore 45+45-3 = 87.
  -- The sum of the units digits of all the multiples of 3 between 0 and 30 is therefore 45.
  -- The sum of the units digits of all the multiples of 3 between 0 and 24 is therefore 45-3 = 42.
  -- The sum of the units digits of all the multiples of 3 between 0 and 18 is therefore 45-3-6 = 36.
  -- The sum of the units digits of all the multiples of 3 between 0 and 12 is therefore 45-3-6-9 = 17.
  -- The sum of the units digits of all the multiples of 3 between 0 and 6 is therefore 12.
  -- The sum of the units digits of all the multiples of 3 between 0 and 50 is therefore 102-17-6-3-9-2-5-8-1-4-7-0 = 78.
