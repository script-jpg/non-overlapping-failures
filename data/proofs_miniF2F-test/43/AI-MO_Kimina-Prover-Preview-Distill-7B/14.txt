-- We want to find the sum of the units digits of all the multiples of $3$ between $0$ and $50$.
  -- First, list all the multiples of 3 between 0 and 50:
  -- 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48

  -- Next, we'll find the units digit of each:
  -- 0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8

  -- Now, let's sum these digits:
  -- 0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 + 1 + 4 + 7 + 0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 = 78

  -- We can use Lean's computational capabilities to verify this calculation
