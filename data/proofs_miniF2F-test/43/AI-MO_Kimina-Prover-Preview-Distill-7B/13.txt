/- We want to calculate the sum of the units digits of all the multiples of 3 between 0 and 50.
     First, let's identify all the multiples of 3 in this range. The smallest is 3 itself, and the largest is 48.
     They form an arithmetic sequence with first term 3, last term 48, and common difference 3. We can calculate
     the number of terms by solving 3 + (n-1)*3 = 48, which gives n = 16. So there are 16 terms in this sequence.
     The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula S_n = n/2 * (a_1 + a_n), where a_1 is the first term
     and a_n is the last term. Substituting the values, we get S_16 = 16/2 * (3 + 48) = 8 * 51 = 408. So the sum of all
     multiples of 3 between 0 and 50 is 408. -/
  /- The unit digit of a number is its remainder when divided by 10. So we want to calculate the sum
     of the remainders of all multiples of 3 between 0 and 50 when divided by 10. -/
  /- To solve this, we'll first find the pattern of the unit digits of multiples of 3. Let's list
     the first few multiples of 3: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30,...
     Taking remainders when divided by 10: 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 0,...
     We can see that the unit digits repeat every 10 numbers: 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 0.
     Since our range goes up to 50, we have 5 complete cycles of 10 numbers. The sum of one cycle is
     3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 + 1 + 4 + 7 + 0 = 45. So the sum for 5 cycles is 5 * 45 = 225. -/
  /- Now, let's verify this with Lean. We'll start by importing the necessary libraries and setting up
     the theorem statement: -/
