-- We need to compute the sum of the units digits of all the multiples of 3 between 0 and 50.
  -- First, let's identify these multiples: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48.
  -- Then we'll extract their units digits: 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8.
  -- Finally, we'll sum these digits: 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 + 1 + 4 + 7 + 0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 = 78.
