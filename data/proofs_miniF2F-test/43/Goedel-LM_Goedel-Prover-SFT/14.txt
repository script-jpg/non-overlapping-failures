  To find the sum of the units digits of all the multiples of 3 between 0 and 50, we can follow these steps:
  1. Identify the range of numbers from 0 to 50.
  2. Determine the multiples of 3 within this range.
  3. Calculate the units digit of each of these multiples.
  4. Sum the units digits.
  The multiples of 3 between 0 and 50 are 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48.
  The units digits of these numbers are:
  - 3: 3
  - 6: 6
  - 9: 9
  - 12: 2
  - 15: 5
  - 18: 8
  - 21: 1
  - 24: 4
  - 27: 7
  - 30: 0
  - 33: 3
  - 36: 6
  - 39: 9
  - 42: 2
  - 45: 5
  - 48: 8
  Summing these units digits: \(3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 + 1 + 4 + 7 + 0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 = 78\).
