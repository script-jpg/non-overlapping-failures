  To determine the sum of the units digits of all the multiples of 3 between 0 and 50, we need to identify the multiples of 3 within this range and then extract the units digits of these numbers. The units digits of the multiples of 3 within this range are 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48. Summing these units digits, we find that the sum is 78.
