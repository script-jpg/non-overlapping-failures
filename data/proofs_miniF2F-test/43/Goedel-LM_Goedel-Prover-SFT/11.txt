  To determine the sum of the units digits of all the multiples of 3 between 0 and 50, we need to consider the units digits of the numbers in the range from 0 to 49 that are divisible by 3. These numbers are 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, and 48. We observe that the units digits of these numbers are 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, and 8. Summing these units digits, we get:
  \[ 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 + 1 + 4 + 7 + 0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 = 78 \]
  Thus, the sum of the units digits of all the multiples of 3 between 0 and 50 is indeed 78.
