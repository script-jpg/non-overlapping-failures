  To determine the sum of the units digits of all the multiples of 3 between 0 and 50, we need to consider the units digits of these multiples. The units digits of multiples of 3 cycle every 3 numbers: 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, and so on. We need to find the sum of these units digits within the range from 0 to 50.

  -- Simplify the sum by filtering the range of numbers from 0 to 50 to include only those that are multiples of 3.

  -- The units digits of multiples of 3 cycle every 3 numbers: 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, and so on.
  -- We need to sum these units digits within the range from 0 to 50.
  -- The sum of the units digits of multiples of 3 in the range from 0 to 50 is 78.
