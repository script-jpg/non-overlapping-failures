  To determine the sum of the units digits of all multiples of 3 between 0 and 50, we need to identify the multiples of 3 within this range and then find the units digits of these multiples. The multiples of 3 between 0 and 50 are 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48. The units digits of these numbers are 0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8. Summing these units digits, we get:
  \[ 0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 + 1 + 4 + 7 = 42 \]
  However, we need to exclude the number 0 (which is not a multiple of 3 within the specified range). Therefore, the sum of the units digits is:
  \[ 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 + 1 + 4 + 7 = 37 \]
  Thus, the sum of the units digits of all multiples of 3 between 0 and 50 is 78.
