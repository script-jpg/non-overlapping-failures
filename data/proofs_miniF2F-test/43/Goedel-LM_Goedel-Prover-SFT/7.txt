  To determine the sum of the units digits of all multiples of 3 between 0 and 50, we can focus on the units digits of the numbers in this range. The units digits of multiples of 3 can be grouped into patterns: 0, 3, 6, 9, and 0 repeats every 10 numbers. Specifically, the units digits of the numbers 3, 6, 9, 0, 3, 6, 9, 0,... are 3, 6, 9, 0, repeating every 4 numbers.
  Given this periodicity, we can sum the units digits over one period of 10 numbers:
  \[
  (0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 0)
  \]
  This simplifies to:
  \[
  (0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 0) = 78
  \]
  Thus, the sum of the units digits of all multiples of 3 between 0 and 50 is 78.
