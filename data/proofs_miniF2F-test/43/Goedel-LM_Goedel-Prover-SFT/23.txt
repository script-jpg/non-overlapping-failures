  To find the sum of the units digits of all the multiples of 3 between 0 and 50, we can use the properties of finite sums and modular arithmetic. Specifically, we will sum the units digits of the numbers that are multiples of 3 within the specified range.
  1. **Identify the multiples of 3 within the range**: The multiples of 3 between 0 and 50 are 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48.
  2. **Determine the units digits**: The units digits of these numbers are 3, 6, 9, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8.
  3. **Sum the units digits**: Adding these units digits together:
     \[
     3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 7 + 0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 = 78
     \]
  Thus, the sum of the units digits of all the multiples of 3 between 0 and 50 is 78.
