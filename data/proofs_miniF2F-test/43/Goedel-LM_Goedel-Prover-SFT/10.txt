  To determine the sum of the units digits of all the multiples of 3 between 0 and 50, we need to find the units digits of the multiples of 3 within this range and then sum them up. The units digit of a number is the remainder when the number is divided by 10.
  1. **Identify the multiples of 3 within the range**: The multiples of 3 between 0 and 50 are \(3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48\).
  2. **Determine the units digits**: The units digits of these numbers are \(3, 6, 9, 2, 3, 6, 9, 2, 3, 6, 9, 2, 3, 6, 9, 2\).
  3. **Sum the units digits**: The sum of the units digits is \(3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 = 78\).
