  To find the sum of the units digits of all multiples of 3 between 0 and 50, we need to identify the units digits of these multiples and sum them up. The units digit of a number is the remainder when the number is divided by 10.
  1. **Identify the multiples of 3 within the range**: The multiples of 3 between 0 and 50 are \(3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48\).
  2. **Determine their units digits**: The units digits of these numbers are \(3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8\).
  3. **Sum the units digits**: Summing these units digits: \(3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 + 1 + 4 + 7 + 0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 = 78\).
  Thus, the sum of the units digits of all multiples of 3 between 0 and 50 is 78.
