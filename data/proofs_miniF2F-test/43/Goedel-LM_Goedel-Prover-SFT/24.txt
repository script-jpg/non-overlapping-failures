  To prove that the sum of the units digits of all the multiples of 3 between 0 and 50 is 78, we start by identifying the multiples of 3 within this range. The multiples of 3 between 0 and 50 are 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, and 48. The units digits of these numbers are 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 0, 3, 6, 9, 4, 5, and 8. Summing these units digits, we get:
  \[ 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 + 1 + 4 + 7 + 0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 4 + 5 + 8 = 78 \]
  Thus, the sum of the units digits of all the multiples of 3 between 0 and 50 is indeed 78.
