  To solve the problem of finding the sum of the units digits of all the multiples of 3 between 0 and 50, we need to follow these steps:
  1. Identify the multiples of 3 within the range from 0 to 50.
  2. Extract the units digits of these multiples.
  3. Sum the units digits and verify that the total is 78.
