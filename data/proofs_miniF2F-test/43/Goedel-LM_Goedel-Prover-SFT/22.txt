  To determine the sum of the units digits of all the multiples of 3 between 0 and 50, we need to identify the multiples of 3 within this range and then extract their units digits. The multiples of 3 between 0 and 50 are:
  \[ 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48 \]
  Next, we extract the units digits of these numbers:
  \[ 0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 1, 6, 3, 4, 7, 0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 1, 6, 3, 4, 7 \]
  Finally, we sum these units digits:
  \[ 0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 3 + 4 + 7 + 0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 3 + 4 + 7 = 78 \]
