  To determine the sum of the units digits of all the multiples of 3 between 0 and 50, we need to identify the multiples of 3 within this range and then extract their units digits. The multiples of 3 between 0 and 50 are: 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48. The units digits of these numbers are: 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8. Summing these units digits:
  \[ 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 + 1 + 4 + 7 + 0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 = 78 \]
  Thus, the sum of the units digits of all the multiples of 3 between 0 and 50 is 78.
