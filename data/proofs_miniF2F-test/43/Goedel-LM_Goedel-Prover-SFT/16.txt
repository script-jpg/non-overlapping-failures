  To determine the sum of the units digits of all the multiples of 3 between 0 and 50, we start by identifying the range of multiples of 3 within the given bounds. The multiples of 3 between 0 and 50 are 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, and 45. We then sum the units digits of these numbers:
  3: 3
  6: 6
  9: 9
  12: 2
  15: 5
  18: 8
  21: 1
  24: 4
  27: 7
  30: 0
  33: 3
  36: 6
  39: 9
  42: 2
  45: 5
  Summing these units digits:
  \[ 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 + 1 + 4 + 7 + 0 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 = 78 \]
  Thus, the sum of the units digits of all the multiples of 3 between 0 and 50 is 78.
