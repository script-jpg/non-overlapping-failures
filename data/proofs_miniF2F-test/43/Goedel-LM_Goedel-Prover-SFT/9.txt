  To determine the sum of the units digits of all multiples of 3 between 0 and 50, we need to sum the units digits of each number in this range that is divisible by 3. The units digits of multiples of 3 cycle every 3 numbers: 3, 6, 9, and then the pattern repeats. We need to find the sum of these units digits over the range from 0 to 49.
  First, we identify the numbers in this range that are multiples of 3:
  \[ 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48 \]
  Next, we sum the units digits of these numbers:
  \[ 0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 3, 6, 9, 4, 5, 0, 3, 6, 9, 2, 3, 6, 9 \]
  Grouping the units digits in sets of 3:
  \[ (0 + 3 + 6) + (9 + 2 + 3) + (6 + 9 + 4) + (5 + 0 + 3) + (0 + 3 + 6) + (9 + 2 + 3) + (6 + 9 + 4) + (5 + 0 + 3) \]
  Each group sums to 18:
  \[ 18 + 18 + 18 + 18 + 18 + 18 + 18 + 18 = 144 \]
  Since there are 144 units digits, and each group sums to 18, the sum of all the units digits is:
  \[ 144 \div 3 = 48 \]
  However, we need to account for the fact that the sum of the units digits of the numbers from 0 to 49 is actually 78, which is the sum of the units digits of the numbers in the range from 0 to 49 that are divisible by 3.
