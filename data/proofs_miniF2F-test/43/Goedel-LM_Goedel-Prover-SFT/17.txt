  To determine the sum of the units digits of all multiples of 3 between 0 and 50, we need to sum the units digits of all numbers in this range that are divisible by 3. The units digits of multiples of 3 follow a repeating pattern: 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8. We need to count how many multiples of 3 are in the range from 0 to 50 and then sum the units digits of these numbers.
  1. **Counting the multiples of 3 in the range**:
     - The multiples of 3 in the range from 0 to 50 are 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48.
     - There are 16 such numbers.
  2. **Summing the units digits**:
     - The units digits of these numbers are 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8.
     - Summing these digits: \(3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 5 + 8 = 33\).
  Thus, the sum of the units digits of all multiples of 3 between 0 and 50 is 78.
