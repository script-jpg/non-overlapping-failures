  To determine the sum of the units digits of all the multiples of 3 between 0 and 50, we start by identifying the multiples of 3 within this range. The multiples of 3 between 0 and 50 are 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, and 51. We then sum the units digits of these numbers:
  \[
  3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 9 + 2
  \]
  By simplifying the sum step by step, we find that the total sum of the units digits is 78.
