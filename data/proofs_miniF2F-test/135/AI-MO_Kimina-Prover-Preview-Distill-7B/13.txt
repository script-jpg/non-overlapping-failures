-- We shall show that the sum of the even-indexed terms is 93.
  -- First, let's think about how to approach this. We have an arithmetic progression with common difference 1,
  -- so each term is the previous term plus 1. We also know that the sum of all terms from $a_1$ to $a_{98}$ is 137.

  -- Let's write a recurrence relation for the sum of even-indexed terms.
  have h₂ : (∑ k in Finset.range 49, u (2 * k.succ)) = 49 + (∑ k in Finset.range 48, u (2 * k.succ + 1)) := by
    rw [Finset.sum_range_succ]
    have h : 2 * 48 = 96 := by norm_num
    rw [h]
    have h : 2 * 49 = 98 := by norm_num
    rw [h]
    simp only [Nat.reduceMul, h]
    rw [Finset.sum_range_succ]
    ring_nf

  -- We've established that the sum of even-indexed terms equals 49 plus the sum of odd-indexed terms.
  -- Now, let's do the same for the sum of odd-indexed terms:

  have h₃ : (∑ k in Finset.range 48, u (2 * k.succ + 1)) = 48 + (∑ k in Finset.range 48, u (2 * k.succ + 2)) := by
    rw [Finset.sum_range_succ]
    simp only [Nat.reduceMul]
    rw [Finset.sum_range_succ]
    ring_nf

  -- The sum of odd-indexed terms equals 48 plus the sum of terms at even indices + 2.
  -- Now we need to combine these to solve for the sum of even-indexed terms.

  have h₄ : (∑ k in Finset.range 49, u (2 * k.succ)) = 93 := by
    linarith

  -- And that's it! We've shown that the sum of even-indexed terms from $a_2$ to $a_{98}$ is 93.

  exact h₄
