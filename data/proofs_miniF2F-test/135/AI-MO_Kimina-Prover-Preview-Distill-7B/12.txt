--3.1 Write down the system of equations for the arithmetic progression

  -- We denote the first term as a and the common difference as d.
  let a := u 0
  let d := 1

  -- The terms of the arithmetic progression can be expressed in terms of a and d.
  have h u n : u n = a + n * d := by
    -- We prove this by induction on n.
    induction n with
    | zero => simp [a, d]
    | succ n ih => simp [h₀, ih]

  -- Let r be the number of terms in the sum, and write down the equation for the sum in terms of r, a, and d.
  let r := 98
  have h₂ : ∑ k ∈ Finset.range r, u k.succ = r * a + r * (r - 1) / 2 * d := by
    -- We prove this by induction on r.
    induction r with
    | zero => simp
    | succ r ih => simp [Finset.sum_range_succ, h₂, h₀]

  -- Substitute in the given values, and solve for a.
  simpi [h₂] at h₁
  have h₃ : a = 1 - 97 / 196 := by linarith

  -- We are asked to find the value of the sum $a_2+a_4+a_6+a_8+\ldots+a_{98}$.
  have h₄ : ∑ k in Finset.range 49, u (2 * k.succ) = r * a + r * (r - 1) / 2 * d := by
    -- We prove this by induction on r.
    induction r with
    | zero => simp
    | succ r ih => simp [Finset.sum_range_succ, h₄, h₀]

  -- Substitute in the values, and solve for the answer.
