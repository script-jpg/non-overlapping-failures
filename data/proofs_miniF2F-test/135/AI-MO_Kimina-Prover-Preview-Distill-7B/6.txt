/- The following is the solution given on the official AIME 1984 solution page.
    It is a bit different from mine, and I think it's incorrect. If it's right, then
    may I know how?

    The terms $a_2, a_4, \dots, a_{98}$ are precisely the terms $a_{2k}$ where $1 \le k
    \le 49$.  The reason is that the only even numbers between $1$ and $98$ are $2, 4, 6, \dots,
    98$.

    By the common difference of the progression, we have $a_{2k} = a_k + k$ for all $1 \le k
    \le 49$.  Thus, \[\sum_{k=1}^{49} a_{2k} = \sum_{k=1}^{49} (a_k + k) = \sum_{k=1}^{49}
    a_k + \sum_{k=1}^{49} k.\]The first sum on the right-hand side is the sum of all $a_i$
    from $1$ to $49$, and the second sum on the right-hand side is just the sum of the first
    $49$ positive integers.

    By the common difference, we have\[\sum_{k=1}^{98} a_k = \sum_{k=1}^{98} (a_{k-1} + 1)=
    \sum_{k=1}^{98} a_{k-1} + 98 = \sum_{k=0}^{97} a_k.\]This shows that the sum of all $a_i$
    from $1$ to $49$ is equal to the sum of all $a_i$ from $0$ to $97$.

    Adding $a_0$ to both sides, we have\[\sum_{k=0}^{48} a_{2k} = \sum_{k=0}^{97} a_k.\]But
    since $a_{97} + a_{98} = 195$, we have $\sum_{k=0}^{48} a_{2k} = 195 - a_{97} = 195 -
    (137 - \sum_{k=1}^{49} a_{2k}) = 58 + \sum_{k=1}^{49} a_{2k}.$  Subtracting $\sum_{k=1}^{49}
    a_{2k}$ from both sides, we get $\sum_{k=0}^{48} a_{2k} - \sum_{k=1}^{49} a_{2k} = 58 -
    \sum_{k=1}^{49} a_{2k}.$  The left-hand side is just $a_0$, and so we have $a_0 = 58 -
    \sum_{k=1}^{49} a_{2k}.$  Subtracting $a_0$ from both sides of the earlier equation
    \[\sum_{k=0}^{48} a_{2k} = \sum_{k=0}^{97} a_k,\]we get $\sum_{k=1}^{49} a_{2k} = 137 -
    \sum_{k=1}^{49} a_{2k},$ and so $\sum_{k=1}^{49} a_{2k} = 68.$  Then by the equation
    \[\sum_{k=1}^{98} a_k = \sum_{k=0}^{97} a_k,\]we have $\sum_{k=1}^{49} a_{2k} + \sum_{k=1}^{49}
    a_{2k+1} = \sum_{k=0}^{97} a_k = \sum_{k=1}^{98} a_k = 137,$ and so $\sum_{k=1}^{49} a_{2k+1}
    = 137 - \sum_{k=1}^{49} a_{2k} = 137 - 68 = 69.$  Therefore, the answer is $\sum_{k=1}^{49}
    a_{2k} + \sum_{k=1}^{49} a_{2k+1} = 69 + 68 = \boxed{093}.$-/

  The proof is wrong.  The statement that $a_1+a_2+\dots+a_{98}=137$ is violated if we let
  $a_1=a_2=\cdots=a_{97}=1$ and $a_{98}=137-96=91$.  The error is in the equation
  \[\sum_{k=1}^{98} a_k = \sum_{k=0}^{97} a_k.\]If the sequence is 1, 2, 3,..., 97, 91,
  this is false, as the left side is 1+2+...+97+91=1+2+...+97+91=4753, while the right side
  is 1+2+...+97+98=4753+98=4851.
