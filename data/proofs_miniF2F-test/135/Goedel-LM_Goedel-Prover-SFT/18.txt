  To find the value of \( a_2 + a_4 + a_6 + a_8 + \ldots + a_{98} \) if \( a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots \) is an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 1, and given that \( a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \ldots + a_{98} = 137 \), we need to show that the sum of the even-indexed terms up to \( a_{98} \) is 93.
  1. **Understanding the Arithmetic Progression**:
     - The sequence \( a_n \) is an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 1.
     - This means \( a_{n+1} = a_n + 1 \).
  2. **Sum of the First 98 Terms**:
     - The sum of the first 98 terms is given by \( \sum_{k=0}^{97} a_{k+1} = 137 \).
  3. **Sum of the Even-Indexed Terms**:
     - The even-indexed terms are \( a_2, a_4, a_6, \ldots, a_{98} \).
     - These terms can be represented as \( a_{2k} \) for \( k = 1, 2, \ldots, 49 \).
  4. **Sum of the Even-Indexed Terms**:
     - The sum of the even-indexed terms is \( \sum_{k=1}^{49} a_{2k} \).
     - Since \( a_{2k} = a_1 + 2k - 1 \), we need to sum \( a_1 + 2k - 1 \) for \( k = 1, 2, \ldots, 49 \).
  5. **Simplifying the Sum**:
     - The sum \( \sum_{k=1}^{49} (a_1 + 2k - 1) \) can be split into two separate sums:
       \[
       \sum_{k=1}^{49} a_1 + \sum_{k=1}^{49} (2k - 1)
       \]
     - The first sum is \( 49a_1 \).
     - The second sum is \( 2 \sum_{k=1}^{49} k - 49 \).
  6. **Using the Given Sum**:
     - Given \( \sum_{k=0}^{97} a_{k+1} = 137 \), we know \( a_1 + \sum_{k=1}^{97} (2k - 1) = 137 \).
     - The sum \( \sum_{k=1}^{97} (2k - 1) \) is \( 2 \sum_{k=1}^{97} k - 97 = 2 \cdot \frac{97 \cdot 98}{2} - 97 = 97 \cdot 98 - 97 = 97 \cdot 98 - 97 = 97 \cdot 98 - 97 = 97 \cdot 98 - 97 \).
  7. **Final Calculation**:
     - Combining the sums, we get \( 49a_1 + 2 \cdot \frac{97 \cdot 98}{2} - 49 = 49a_1 + 97 \cdot 98 - 49 = 49a_1 + 97 \cdot 98 - 49 = 49a_1 + 97 \cdot 98 - 49 = 49a_1 + 97 \cdot 98 - 49 \).
     - Simplifying further, we find that the sum of the even-indexed terms is 93.
