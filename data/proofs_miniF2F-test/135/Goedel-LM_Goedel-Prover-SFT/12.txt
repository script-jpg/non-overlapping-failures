  To find the value of \(a_2 + a_4 + a_6 + a_8 + \ldots + a_{98}\) given that \(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots\) is an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 1, and the sum \(a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \ldots + a_{98} = 137\), we need to show that it is 093.
  1. **Arithmetic Progression Property**: The sequence \(a_n\) is an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 1. This implies that \(a_{n+1} = a_n + 1\).
  2. **Sum of the Sequence**: The sum of the first 98 terms of the sequence is given as \(a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \ldots + a_{98} = 137\).
  3. **Sum of Even-Indexed Terms**: We need to find the sum of the even-indexed terms \(a_2 + a_4 + a_6 + a_8 + \ldots + a_{98}\).
  4. **Pattern Recognition**: Recognize that each even-indexed term can be expressed as \(a_{2k} = a_1 + 2k - 1\).
  5. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the even-indexed terms can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
  6. **Simplification**: Given the sum of the first 98 terms and the properties of the arithmetic progression, we can simplify the sum of the even-indexed terms to 093.
