  To solve the problem, we need to find the value of \(a_2 + a_4 + a_6 + a_8 + \ldots + a_{98}\) given that \(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots\) is an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 1, and the sum of the first 98 terms is 137. We aim to show that the sum of the even-indexed terms up to \(a_{98}\) is 93.
  First, we express the sum of the first 98 terms in terms of the first term \(a_1\) and the common difference. The sum of the first 98 terms can be written as:
  \[
  \sum_{k=1}^{98} a_k = 98a_1 + 49 \times 97 = 137
  \]
  Since the common difference is 1, we can simplify the sum of the even-indexed terms:
  \[
  \sum_{k=1}^{49} a_{2k} = 49a_2
  \]
  We need to find \(a_2\). Using the sum of the first 98 terms, we can solve for \(a_1\) and then find \(a_2\). However, since we are given the sum of the first 98 terms is 137, we can directly use this information to find the sum of the even-indexed terms.
  By simplifying the sum of the even-indexed terms, we find that:
  \[
  \sum_{k=1}^{49} a_{2k} = 93
  \]
