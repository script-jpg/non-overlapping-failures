  Given an arithmetic progression \( a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots \) with a common difference of 1, and the sum \( a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \ldots + a_{98} = 137 \), we need to find the value of \( a_2 + a_4 + a_6 + a_8 + \ldots + a_{98} \).
  1. **Identify the sequence pattern**: The sequence \( a_n \) is an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 1. Therefore, \( a_{n+1} = a_n + 1 \).
  2. **Sum of the first 98 terms**: The sum of the first 98 terms is given by \( \sum_{k=1}^{98} a_k = 137 \).
  3. **Sum of even-indexed terms**: We need to find the sum \( \sum_{k=1}^{49} a_{2k} \).
  4. **Simplify the sum**: Since \( a_{2k} = a_1 + 2k - 1 \), we can express the sum as \( \sum_{k=1}^{49} (a_1 + 2k - 1) \).
  5. **Use the given sum**: Given \( \sum_{k=1}^{98} a_k = 137 \), we can use this information to find the sum of the even-indexed terms.
  6. **Calculate the sum**: The sum of the even-indexed terms can be derived from the given sum and the properties of the arithmetic progression.
