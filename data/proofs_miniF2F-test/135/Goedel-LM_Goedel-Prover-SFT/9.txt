  Given an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 1, we need to find the value of \(a_2 + a_4 + a_6 + a_8 + \ldots + a_{98}\) given that \(a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \ldots + a_{98} = 137\). We need to show that this sum is 093.

  -- We start by expressing the sum of the arithmetic progression in terms of the first term and the common difference.
  have h₂ : ∑ k in Finset.range 98, u k.succ = 137 := h₁
  -- We need to find the sum of the even-indexed terms of the progression.
  have h₃ : ∑ k in Finset.range 49, u (2 * k.succ) = 93 := by
    -- Simplify the sum by expanding and rearranging terms.
    simp_all only [Finset.sum_range_succ, Finset.sum_range_zero, Nat.cast_zero, Nat.cast_succ,
      Nat.zero_eq, Nat.one_eq_succ_zero]
    -- Use linear arithmetic to solve for the sum of the even-indexed terms.
    linarith
  -- The final result is the sum of the even-indexed terms.
