  To find the value of \(a_2 + a_4 + a_6 + a_8 + \ldots + a_{98}\) given that \(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots\) is an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 1, and the sum \(a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \ldots + a_{98} = 137\), we need to show that the sum of the even-indexed terms up to \(a_{98}\) is 093.
  1. **Sum of the first 98 terms**: The sum of the first 98 terms is given by \(a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \ldots + a_{98} = 137\).
  2. **Sum of the even-indexed terms**: We need to find the sum \(a_2 + a_4 + a_6 + a_8 + \ldots + a_{98}\).
  3. **Common difference**: Since the common difference is 1, the terms of the arithmetic progression are \(a_1 = 1, a_2 = 2, a_3 = 3, \ldots\).
  4. **Even-indexed terms**: The even-indexed terms are \(a_2, a_4, a_6, a_8, \ldots, a_{98}\).
  5. **Sum of the even-indexed terms**: The sum of the even-indexed terms can be calculated by summing the terms \(a_2 + a_4 + a_6 + a_8 + \ldots + a_{98}\).
  6. **Simplification**: The sum of the even-indexed terms is \(2 + 4 + 6 + \ldots + 98 = 2 \times (1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + 49) = 2 \times \frac{49 \times 50}{2} = 2 \times 1225 = 2450\).
  7. **Final sum**: Given the sum of the first 98 terms is 137, the sum of the even-indexed terms is \(2450 - 137 = 2313\).
