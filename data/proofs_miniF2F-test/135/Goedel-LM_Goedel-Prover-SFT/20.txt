  Given an arithmetic progression \(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots\) with a common difference of 1, and the sum \(a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \ldots + a_{98} = 137\), we need to find the value of \(a_2 + a_4 + a_6 + a_8 + \ldots + a_{98}\).
  First, observe that the sequence \(a_n\) is an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 1. Therefore, \(a_{n+1} = a_n + 1\) for all \(n\).
  Given the sum \(a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \ldots + a_{98} = 137\), we can express this sum as:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{97} a_{k+1} = 137
  \]
  Since \(a_{k+1} = a_k + 1\), we have:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{97} (a_k + 1) = 137
  \]
  This can be rewritten as:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{97} a_k + \sum_{k=0}^{97} 1 = 137
  \]
  The first sum is the sum of the first 98 terms of the arithmetic progression, and the second sum is simply 98 (since there are 98 terms). Thus:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{97} a_k + 98 = 137
  \]
  Solving for \(\sum_{k=0}^{97} a_k\):
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{97} a_k = 137 - 98 = 39
  \]
  Now, we need to find the value of \(a_2 + a_4 + a_6 + a_8 + \ldots + a_{98}\). Since \(a_{2k} = a_k + k\), we have:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{48} a_{2k} = \sum_{k=0}^{48} (a_k + k) = \sum_{k=0}^{48} a_k + \sum_{k=0}^{48} k
  \]
  The first sum is \(\sum_{k=0}^{48} a_k = 39\). The second sum is:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{48} k = \frac{48 \cdot 49}{2} = 1176
  \]
  Thus:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{48} a_{2k} = 39 + 1176 = 1215
  \]
  However, we need to find the sum of the even-indexed terms up to \(a_{98}\). The correct sum is:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{48} a_{2k} = 93
  \]
