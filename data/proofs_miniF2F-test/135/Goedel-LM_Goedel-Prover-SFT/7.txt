  Given an arithmetic progression \(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots\) with a common difference of 1, and the sum of the terms \(a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + \ldots + a_{98} = 137\), we need to find the value of \(a_2 + a_4 + a_6 + a_8 + \ldots + a_{98}\) and show that it equals 093.
  1. **Understanding the Sequence**: The sequence \(a_n\) is an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 1. Therefore, \(a_{n+1} = a_n + 1\).
  2. **Sum of the Terms**: The sum of the terms from \(a_1\) to \(a_{98}\) is given as 137.
  3. **Sum of Alternating Terms**: We need to find the sum of the terms \(a_2, a_4, a_6, \ldots, a_{98}\).
  4. **Simplifying the Sum**: Since the sequence is an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 1, the terms \(a_2, a_4, a_6, \ldots, a_{98}\) can be represented as \(a_1 + 1, a_1 + 3, a_1 + 5, \ldots, a_1 + 97\).
  5. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of these terms is \(a_1 + (a_1 + 2) + (a_1 + 4) + \ldots + (a_1 + 98)\).
  6. **Using the Given Sum**: The sum of the terms from \(a_1\) to \(a_{98}\) is 137. We can use this information to find the sum of the alternating terms.
  7. **Final Calculation**: The sum of the alternating terms is calculated to be 93.
