/-Given the arithmetic progression \( a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots \) with a common difference of 1, and the sum of the first 98 terms \( a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_{98} = 137 \), we need to find the value of \( a_2 + a_4 + a_6 + a_8 + \ldots + a_{98} \).
  The sum of the first 49 terms of the sequence, where each term is twice the index of the corresponding term in the original sequence, can be expressed as:
  \[ \sum_{k=0}^{48} a_{2k+2} \]
  Since the original sequence is an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 1, the sequence \( a_{2k+2} \) can be derived from the original sequence by shifting by 2 units. Therefore, the sum of the first 49 terms is:
  \[ \sum_{k=0}^{48} a_{2k+2} = \sum_{k=0}^{48} (a_2 + 2k) \]
  Given the sum of the first 98 terms \( a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_{98} = 137 \), we can use the properties of arithmetic progressions and the given sum to find the value of the required sum.
