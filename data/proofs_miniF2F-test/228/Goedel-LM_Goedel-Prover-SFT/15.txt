  To evaluate \(\left(\frac{i}{2}\right)^2\) and show that it is \(-\frac{1}{4}\), we proceed as follows:
  1. Start by expressing \(\left(\frac{i}{2}\right)^2\) as \(\frac{i^2}{4}\).
  2. Use the property that \(i^2 = -1\).
  3. Substitute \(i^2\) with \(-1\) in the expression \(\frac{i^2}{4}\).
  4. Simplify the resulting expression to obtain \(-\frac{1}{4}\).

  -- Express the square of the complex number i/2 as (i/2) * (i/2)
  simp only [sq, mul_neg, mul_one, neg_mul, neg_neg]
  -- Simplify the expression using the property that i^2 = -1
  norm_num
  -- Further simplify the expression to obtain the final result
  <;> simp [Complex.I_mul_I]
  -- Normalize the numerical expression to confirm the result
