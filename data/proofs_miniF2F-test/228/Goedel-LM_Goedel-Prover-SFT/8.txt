  To evaluate \(\left(\frac{i}{2}\right)^2\) and show that it equals \(-\frac{1}{4}\), we proceed as follows:
  1. Compute \(\left(\frac{i}{2}\right)^2\).
  2. Simplify the expression by expanding the square.
  3. Use the property \(i^2 = -1\) to simplify the resulting expression.
  4. Verify that the simplified expression matches \(-\frac{1}{4}\).
