  To evaluate \(\left(\frac{i}{2}\right)^2\), we start by expressing the square of the complex number \(\frac{i}{2}\). We use the property of the square of a fraction, which states that \(\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^2 = \frac{a^2}{b^2}\). Applying this property, we get:
  \[
  \left(\frac{i}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{i^2}{2^2}
  \]
  Next, we simplify \(i^2\) and \(2^2\). We know that \(i^2 = -1\) and \(2^2 = 4\). Substituting these values into the expression, we obtain:
  \[
  \frac{i^2}{2^2} = \frac{-1}{4}
  \]
  Thus, we have shown that \(\left(\frac{i}{2}\right)^2 = -\frac{1}{4}\).
