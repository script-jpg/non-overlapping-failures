  To evaluate \(\left(\frac{i}{2}\right)^2\) and show that it is \(-\frac{1}{4}\), we proceed as follows:
  1. Start by expressing \(\left(\frac{i}{2}\right)^2\) as \(\left(\frac{i}{2}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{i}{2}\right)\).
  2. Use the property of multiplication by the imaginary unit \(i\), where \(i^2 = -1\).
  3. Substitute \(i^2\) with \(-1\) in the expression.
  4. Simplify the resulting expression to obtain \(-\frac{1}{4}\).
