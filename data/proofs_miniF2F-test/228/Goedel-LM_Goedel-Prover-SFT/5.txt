  To prove that \(\left(\frac{i}{2}\right)^2 = -\frac{1}{4}\), we start by simplifying the expression step by step. First, we compute \(\left(\frac{i}{2}\right)^2\), which is \(\left(\frac{i}{2}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{i}{2}\right)\). This results in:
  \[
  \left(\frac{i}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{i^2}{4}
  \]
  Next, we use the fact that \(i^2 = -1\). Substituting \(i^2\) with \(-1\), we get:
  \[
  \frac{i^2}{4} = \frac{-1}{4}
  \]
  Thus, we have shown that:
  \[
  \left(\frac{i}{2}\right)^2 = -\frac{1}{4}
  \]
