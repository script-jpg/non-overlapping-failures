  To evaluate \(\left(\frac{i}{2}\right)^2\), we start by expressing \(\left(\frac{i}{2}\right)^2\) as \(\left(\frac{i}{2}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{i}{2}\right)\). We then simplify the product using the properties of complex numbers and arithmetic operations. Specifically, we use the fact that \(i^2 = -1\) and simplify the resulting expression to obtain \(-1/4\).
