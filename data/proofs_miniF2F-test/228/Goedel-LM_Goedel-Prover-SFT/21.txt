  To evaluate \(\left(\frac{i}{2}\right)^2\), we start by expressing the square of the complex number \(\frac{i}{2}\). We use the property of complex numbers and their squares. Specifically, we know that \(i^2 = -1\). Therefore, we can rewrite the expression as:
  \[
  \left(\frac{i}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{i^2}{4}
  \]
  Since \(i^2 = -1\), we substitute \(-1\) for \(i^2\) in the expression:
  \[
  \frac{i^2}{4} = \frac{-1}{4}
  \]
  Thus, we have shown that \(\left(\frac{i}{2}\right)^2 = -\frac{1}{4}\).
