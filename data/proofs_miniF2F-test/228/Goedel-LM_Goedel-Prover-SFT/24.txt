  To evaluate \(\left(\frac{i}{2}\right)^2\) and show that it is \(-\frac{1}{4}\), we proceed as follows:
  1. Start by expressing \(\left(\frac{i}{2}\right)^2\) as \(\left(\frac{i}{2} \times \frac{i}{2}\right)\).
  2. Use the property of multiplication of complex numbers, \(i \times i = -1\), to simplify the expression.
  3. Combine the terms and simplify to obtain the final result.

  -- Normalize the expression to achieve the final result.
