  To evaluate \(\left(\frac{i}{2}\right)^2\), we start by expressing the square of the complex number \(\frac{i}{2}\). We use the property of the square of a quotient, which gives us \(\left(\frac{i}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{i^2}{2^2}\). Next, we compute \(i^2\) and \(2^2\). Since \(i^2 = -1\), the expression simplifies to \(\frac{-1}{4}\). Thus, we have \(\left(\frac{i}{2}\right)^2 = -\frac{1}{4}\).
