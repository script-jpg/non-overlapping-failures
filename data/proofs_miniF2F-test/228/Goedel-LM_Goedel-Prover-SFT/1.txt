  To evaluate \(\left(\frac{i}{2}\right)^2\) and show that it equals \(-\frac{1}{4}\), we proceed as follows:
  1. Start by expressing the square of \(\frac{i}{2}\).
  2. Use the property of the imaginary unit \(i\) such that \(i^2 = -1\).
  3. Simplify the expression step by step to reach the final result.

  -- Simplify the expression using the property of powers and division.
  simp only [pow_two, div_eq_mul_inv]
  -- Simplify further using the property of multiplication and the fact that \(i^2 = -1\).
  simp only [mul_assoc, Complex.I_sq, mul_neg, mul_one]
  -- Normalize the numerical values to confirm the result.
  norm_num
  -- Simplify the final expression to match the desired result.
