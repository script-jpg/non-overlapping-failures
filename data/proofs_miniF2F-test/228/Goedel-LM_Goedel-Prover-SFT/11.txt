  To evaluate \(\left(\frac{i}{2}\right)^2\), we start by expressing the square of the fraction \(\frac{i}{2}\). We have:
  \[
  \left(\frac{i}{2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{i}{2}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{i}{2}\right)
  \]
  Next, we expand this product using the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials):
  \[
  \left(\frac{i}{2}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{i}{2}\right) = \frac{i \cdot i}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{i^2}{4}
  \]
  Since \(i^2 = -1\), we substitute this value into the expression:
  \[
  \frac{i^2}{4} = \frac{-1}{4}
  \]
  Thus, we have shown that:
  \[
  \left(\frac{i}{2}\right)^2 = -\frac{1}{4}
  \]
