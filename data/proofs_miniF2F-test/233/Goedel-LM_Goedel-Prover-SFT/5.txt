  To find the smallest positive integer \( N \) such that \( 7 + (30 \times N) \) is not a prime number, we need to show that \( N \geq 6 \). We will use contradiction and contradiction to prove this.
  1. Assume for contradiction that \( N < 6 \).
  2. Consider the possible values of \( N \):
     - If \( N = 0 \), then \( 7 + (30 \times 0) = 7 \), which is a prime number.
     - If \( N = 1 \), then \( 7 + (30 \times 1) = 37 \), which is a prime number.
     - If \( N = 2 \), then \( 7 + (30 \times 2) = 77 \), which is not a prime number.
     - If \( N = 3 \), then \( 7 + (30 \times 3) = 107 \), which is a prime number.
     - If \( N = 4 \), then \( 7 + (30 \times 4) = 137 \), which is a prime number.
     - If \( N = 5 \), then \( 7 + (30 \times 5) = 167 \), which is a prime number.
  3. Since none of these values of \( N \) satisfy the condition \( 7 + (30 \times N) \) not being a prime number, we conclude that \( N < 6 \) leads to a contradiction.
  4. Therefore, \( N \geq 6 \).
