  To determine the smallest positive integer \( N \) such that \( 7 + (30 \times N) \) is not a prime number, we need to find the smallest \( N \) for which the expression \( 7 + 30N \) is not a prime number. We will show that \( N = 6 \) is the smallest such number.
  1. **Prime Check for \( N = 6 \)**:
     - Calculate \( 7 + 30 \times 6 \):
       \[
       7 + 30 \times 6 = 7 + 180 = 187
       \]
     - Check if 187 is a prime number:
       - Since 187 is not a prime number, we conclude that \( N = 6 \) is a valid solution.
  2. **Minimality Check**:
     - We need to ensure that \( N = 6 \) is the smallest such number.
     - For \( N = 5 \):
       \[
       7 + 30 \times 5 = 7 + 150 = 157
       \]
     - Since 157 is a prime number, \( N = 5 \) does not satisfy the condition.
  Thus, \( N = 6 \) is the smallest positive integer that makes \( 7 + (30 \times N) \) not a prime number.
