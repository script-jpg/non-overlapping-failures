  To determine the smallest positive integer \( N \) such that \( 7 + (30 \times N) \) is not a prime number, we need to find the smallest \( N \) for which the expression \( 7 + 30N \) is not prime. We claim that \( N = 6 \) is the smallest such integer.
  First, we note that for \( N = 6 \), the expression \( 7 + 30 \times 6 \) is calculated as follows:
  \[ 7 + 30 \times 6 = 7 + 180 = 187 \]
  We need to check if 187 is a prime number. By definition, a prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Since 187 is not a prime number, we have verified that \( N = 6 \) satisfies the condition.
  Next, we need to show that no smaller positive integer \( N \) satisfies the condition. We do this by checking each integer from 1 to 5 and ensuring that \( 7 + 30N \) is not prime.
