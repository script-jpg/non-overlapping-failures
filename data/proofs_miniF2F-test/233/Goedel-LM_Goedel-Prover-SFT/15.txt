  To find the smallest positive integer \( N \) such that \( 7 + 30N \) is not a prime number, we need to show that \( N \geq 6 \). We will proceed by contradiction. Assume \( N < 6 \). We will check each value of \( N \) from 1 to 5 and show that \( 7 + 30N \) is prime for each case, contradicting the given condition that \( 7 + 30N \) is not prime.
