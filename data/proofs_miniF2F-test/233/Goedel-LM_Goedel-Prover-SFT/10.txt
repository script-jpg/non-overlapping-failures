  To determine the smallest positive integer \( N \) such that the value \( 7 + (30 \times N) \) is not a prime number, we need to find the smallest \( N \) for which \( 7 + 30N \) is not prime. We will show that \( N = 6 \) is the smallest such integer.
  1. **Assumption and Setup**: We assume \( 7 + 30n \) is not a prime number. We will prove that \( n \geq 6 \).
  2. **Contradiction Approach**: We use the fact that if \( n < 6 \), then \( 7 + 30n \) would be a prime number. This contradicts our assumption that \( 7 + 30n \) is not a prime number.
  3. **Case Analysis**: We perform a case analysis on \( n \) to show that for \( n < 6 \), \( 7 + 30n \) is prime, while \( 7 + 30 \times 6 \) is not prime.
  4. **Verification**: We verify that \( 7 + 30 \times 6 = 187 \) is not a prime number, and for any \( n < 6 \), \( 7 + 30n \) is prime.
