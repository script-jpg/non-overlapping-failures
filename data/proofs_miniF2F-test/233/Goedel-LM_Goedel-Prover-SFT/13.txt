  To show that the smallest positive integer \( N \) such that the value \( 7 + (30 \times N) \) is not a prime number is 6, we proceed as follows:
  1. Assume for contradiction that \( N < 6 \).
  2. We will check each possible value of \( N \) from 0 to 5 to see if \( 7 + (30 \times N) \) is a prime number.
  3. For each value, we will compute \( 7 + (30 \times N) \) and check if it is prime.
  4. We will find that none of these values are prime, contradicting the assumption that \( 7 + (30 \times N) \) is a prime number for some \( N < 6 \).
  5. Therefore, \( N \) must be at least 6.
