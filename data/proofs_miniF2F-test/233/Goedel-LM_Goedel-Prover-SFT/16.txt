  To show that the smallest positive integer \( N \) such that the value \( 7 + (30 \times N) \) is not a prime number is 6, we proceed as follows:
  1. Assume \( 7 + (30 \times n) \) is not a prime number.
  2. We need to prove that \( 6 \leq n \).
  3. Consider the values of \( 7 + (30 \times n) \) for \( n = 6 \) and \( n = 5 \).
  4. Calculate \( 7 + (30 \times 6) = 7 + 180 = 187 \) and \( 7 + (30 \times 5) = 7 + 150 = 157 \).
  5. Check if 187 and 157 are prime numbers.
  6. Since 187 is not a prime number (as it is divisible by 13), and 157 is also not a prime number (as it is divisible by 13), we conclude that \( 6 \leq n \).
