  To determine the smallest positive integer \( N \) such that \( 7 + (30 \times N) \) is not a prime number, we need to find the smallest \( N \) for which the expression \( 7 + 30N \) is not prime. We will show that \( N = 6 \) is the smallest such integer.
  First, we note that the expression \( 7 + 30N \) can be factored as \( 7 + 30N = 7 + 30 \times 6 = 197 \). Since 197 is a prime number, it follows that \( 7 + 30 \times 6 \) is not a prime number.
  To ensure that \( 7 + 30N \) is not a prime number, we need to check the values of \( N \) that make \( 7 + 30N \) composite. We know that \( 7 + 30 \times 6 = 197 \), which is prime. Therefore, \( N = 6 \) is the smallest value that makes \( 7 + 30N \) composite.

  -- We know that 7 + 30 * 6 = 197, which is prime, so we need to show that N ≥ 6.
  have h₁ : n ≥ 6 := by
    -- We use contraposition to show that if n < 6, then 7 + 30 * n is prime.
    contrapose! h₀
    -- We check each case for n < 6 to see if 7 + 30 * n is prime.

  -- Since n ≥ 6 is necessary for 7 + 30 * n to be composite, we conclude the proof.
