  To show that the smallest positive integer \( N \) such that \( 7 + 30N \) is not a prime number is 6, we proceed as follows:
  1. We need to find the smallest \( N \) such that \( 7 + 30N \) is not prime.
  2. We know that a prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
  3. We will check the values of \( N \) from 0 to 5 and show that \( 7 + 30N \) is not prime for \( N = 6 \).
  4. By contradiction, if \( N < 6 \), then \( 7 + 30N \) would be a prime number, contradicting the given condition that it is not prime.
  5. Therefore, \( N \) must be at least 6.

  -- We will prove that 6 is the smallest such number by contradiction.
  have : 6 ≤ n := by
    -- Assume for contradiction that n < 6.
    by_contra! h
    -- We will check each value of n from 0 to 5 and show that 7 + 30n is not prime.
    revert h₀
    revert n
    -- This is a tautology, so we can directly conclude the proof.
    decide
  -- Since we have shown that 6 ≤ n, we can conclude the theorem.
