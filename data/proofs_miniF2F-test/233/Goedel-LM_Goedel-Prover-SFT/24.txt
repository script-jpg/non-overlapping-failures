  To show that the smallest positive integer \( N \) such that \( 7 + 30 \times N \) is not a prime number is 6, we proceed as follows:
  1. Assume for contradiction that \( 7 + 30 \times n \) is not a prime number for some \( n < 6 \).
  2. We will check each value of \( n \) from 1 to 5 to find the smallest \( n \) that satisfies the condition.
  3. For \( n = 6 \), we calculate \( 7 + 30 \times 6 = 7 + 180 = 187 \).
  4. We verify that 187 is not a prime number.
  5. Since 187 is not a prime number, it follows that 6 is the smallest \( n \) for which \( 7 + 30 \times n \) is not a prime number.

  -- If 7 + 30 * n is not a prime number, it contradicts our assumption
  -- Since 187 is not a prime number, 6 is the smallest n that satisfies the condition
