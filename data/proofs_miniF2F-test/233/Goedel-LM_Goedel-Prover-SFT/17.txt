  To show that the smallest positive integer \( N \) such that the value \( 7 + (30 \times N) \) is not a prime number is 6, we proceed as follows:
  1. Assume for contradiction that \( N < 6 \).
  2. For \( N = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \), compute the value \( 7 + (30 \times N) \) and check if it is prime.
  3. Verify that none of these values are prime.
  4. Since none of these values are prime, we conclude that \( N \) must be at least 6.
