  To show that the smallest positive integer \( N \) such that the value \( 7 + (30 \times N) \) is not a prime number is 6, we proceed as follows:
  1. Assume for contradiction that \( N < 6 \).
  2. For each \( N \) in the range \( 0 \leq N < 6 \), we will check if \( 7 + 30 \times N \) is a prime number.
  3. By evaluating each expression, we will find that none of them are prime numbers.
  4. Therefore, \( N \) must be at least 6.
