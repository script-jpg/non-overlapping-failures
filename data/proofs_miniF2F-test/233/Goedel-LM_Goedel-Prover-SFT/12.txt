  To show that the smallest positive integer \( N \) such that \( 7 + (30 \times N) \) is not a prime number is 6, we proceed as follows:
  1. Assume for contradiction that \( N < 6 \).
  2. Check each value of \( N \) from 0 to 5 to see if \( 7 + (30 \times N) \) is a prime number.
  3. Verify that for \( N = 6 \), \( 7 + (30 \times 6) = 187 \) is not a prime number.
  4. Conclude that \( N \) must be at least 6.
