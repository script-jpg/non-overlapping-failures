  To show that the smallest positive integer \( N \) such that \( 7 + (30 \times N) \) is not a prime number is 6, we proceed as follows:
  1. Assume for contradiction that \( N < 6 \).
  2. Check each possible value of \( N \) less than 6 to see if \( 7 + (30 \times N) \) is a prime number.
  3. For each value, verify that \( 7 + (30 \times N) \) is indeed a prime number, leading to a contradiction.
  4. Conclude that \( N \) must be at least 6.
