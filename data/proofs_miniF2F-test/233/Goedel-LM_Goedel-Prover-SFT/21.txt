  To show that the smallest positive integer \( N \) such that the value \( 7 + (30 \times N) \) is not a prime number is 6, we proceed as follows:
  1. Assume for contradiction that \( N < 6 \).
  2. Check the values of \( 7 + 30 \times N \) for \( N = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \).
  3. Verify that each of these values is a prime number.
  4. Conclude that \( N \) must be at least 6 to ensure \( 7 + 30 \times N \) is not a prime number.
