  To show that the smallest positive integer \( N \) such that \( 7 + 30N \) is not a prime number is 6, we proceed as follows:
  1. Assume for contradiction that \( N < 6 \).
  2. For each \( N \) in the range \( 0 \leq N < 6 \), we check if \( 7 + 30N \) is a prime number.
  3. By direct computation, we find that \( 7 + 30 \times 6 = 187 \) is not a prime number.
  4. Since \( 187 \) is not a prime number, it follows that \( N \) must be at least 6.
