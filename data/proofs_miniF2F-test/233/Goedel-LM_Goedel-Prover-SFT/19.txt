  To show that the smallest positive integer \( N \) such that the value \( 7 + (30 \times N) \) is not a prime number is 6, we proceed as follows:
  1. Assume for contradiction that \( N < 6 \).
  2. Check the values of \( N \) from 1 to 5 and verify that \( 7 + (30 \times N) \) is a prime number for each of these values.
  3. Conclude that since \( 7 + (30 \times n) \) is a prime number for all \( n < 6 \), the smallest \( N \) that satisfies the condition must be 6.
