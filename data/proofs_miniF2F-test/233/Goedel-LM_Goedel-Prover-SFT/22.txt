  To show that the smallest positive integer \( N \) such that the value \( 7 + (30 \times N) \) is not a prime number is 6, we proceed as follows:
  1. We start by assuming \( n \) is a positive integer such that \( 7 + (30 \times n) \) is not a prime number.
  2. We need to prove that \( n \geq 6 \).
  3. We use the fact that if \( n < 6 \), then \( 7 + (30 \times n) \) must be a prime number.
  4. By checking each value of \( n \) from 1 to 5, we find that \( 7 + (30 \times n) \) is prime for each of these values.
  5. Therefore, \( n \) must be at least 6.

  -- Since we have shown that n ≥ 6, we can conclude the proof.
