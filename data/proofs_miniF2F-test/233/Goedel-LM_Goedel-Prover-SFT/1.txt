  To show that the smallest positive integer \( N \) such that \( 7 + (30 \times N) \) is not a prime number is 6, we proceed as follows:
  1. We assume for contradiction that \( n < 6 \).
  2. We check each possible value of \( n \) less than 6 to see if \( 7 + (30 \times n) \) is a prime number.
  3. By evaluating \( 7 + (30 \times n) \) for each \( n \) in the specified range, we find that none of these values are prime.
  4. Therefore, \( n \) must be at least 6.
