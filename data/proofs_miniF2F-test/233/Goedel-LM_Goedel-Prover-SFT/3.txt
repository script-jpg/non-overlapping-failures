  To show that the smallest positive integer \( N \) such that \( 7 + (30 \times N) \) is not a prime number is 6, we proceed as follows:
  1. Assume \( N < 6 \).
  2. Check each possible value of \( N \) from 1 to 5.
  3. Verify that \( 7 + 30 \times N \) is prime for each of these values.
  4. Since \( 7 + 30 \times 6 = 7 + 180 = 187 \) is not prime, \( N \) must be at least 6.

  -- For each case, check if 7 + 30 * n is prime.
  -- If it is prime, the assumption h₀ leads to a contradiction.
  -- Since 7 + 30 * 6 = 187 is not prime, n must be at least 6.
