  To show that the smallest positive integer \( N \) such that \( 7 + (30 \times N) \) is not a prime number is 6, we proceed as follows:
  1. We start by assuming \( 7 + (30 \times n) \) is not a prime number.
  2. We need to prove that \( n \geq 6 \).
  3. We use a proof by contradiction. Assume \( n < 6 \).
  4. We check each possible value of \( n \) less than 6 to see if \( 7 + (30 \times n) \) is a prime number.
  5. By evaluating each case, we find that \( 7 + (30 \times n) \) is a prime number for all \( n < 6 \).
  6. Therefore, \( n \) must be at least 6.
