  To prove that the smallest positive integer \( N \) such that the value \( 7 + (30 \times N) \) is not a prime number is 6, we start by considering the given condition. We need to show that if \( 7 + 30n \) is not a prime number for some \( n \), then \( n \) must be at least 6.
  1. Assume for contradiction that \( n \) is less than 6.
  2. We then check each possible value of \( n \) from 0 to 5 to see if \( 7 + 30n \) is a prime number for each case.
  3. By evaluating each value, we find that none of these expressions are prime, leading to a contradiction.
  4. Therefore, \( n \) must be at least 6.
