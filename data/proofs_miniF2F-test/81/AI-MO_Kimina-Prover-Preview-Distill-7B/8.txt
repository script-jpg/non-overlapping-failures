In this proof, we have two equations:
1. $f + 3z = 11$
2. $3(f - 1) - 5z = -68$

We need to solve for $f$ and $z$. Let's do this step by step.

From the first equation, we can express $f$ in terms of $z$:
$f = 11 - 3z$

Substituting this into the second equation:
$3((11 - 3z) - 1) - 5z = -68$
$3(10 - 3z) - 5z = -68$
$30 - 9z - 5z = -68$
$30 - 14z = -68$
$-14z = -98$
$z = 7$

Now substituting $z = 7$ back into $f = 11 - 3z$:
$f = 11 - 3(7) = 11 - 21 = -10$

So we have $f = -10$ and $z = 7$. The Lean proof uses the `linarith` tactic to solve these linear arithmetic goals automatically. The `linarith` tactic is powerful for solving systems of linear arithmetic constraints over real or complex numbers. It takes the hypotheses `h₀` and `h₁` as inputs, which are our two equations, and derives the goals `f = -10` and `z = 7`.

The complete Lean 4 proof is remarkably concise because Lean's automation can handle systems of linear equations efficiently. This is a testament to how powerful Lean's automation can be for solving arithmetic problems that would typically require several steps of algebraic manipulation by hand.

Therefore, the final answer is $f = -10$ and $z = 7$.
