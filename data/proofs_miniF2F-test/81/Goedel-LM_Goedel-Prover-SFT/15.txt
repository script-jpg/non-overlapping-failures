  Given the equations \( f + 3z = 11 \) and \( 3(f - 1) - 5z = -68 \), we need to show that \( f = -10 \) and \( z = 7 \).
  1. Start by isolating \( f \) in the first equation: \( f = 11 - 3z \).
  2. Substitute \( f = 11 - 3z \) into the second equation: \( 3((11 - 3z) - 1) - 5z = -68 \).
  3. Simplify the equation: \( 3(10 - 3z) - 5z = -68 \).
  4. Distribute and combine like terms: \( 30 - 9z - 5z = -68 \).
  5. Combine like terms: \( 30 - 14z = -68 \).
  6. Solve for \( z \): \( 30 + 68 = 14z \), which simplifies to \( 98 = 14z \), thus \( z = 7 \).
  7. Substitute \( z = 7 \) back into \( f = 11 - 3z \): \( f = 11 - 3 \times 7 \), which simplifies to \( f = 11 - 21 \), thus \( f = -10 \).

  -- Isolate f in the first equation: f = 11 - 3z
  -- Substitute f = 11 - 3z into the second equation: 3((11 - 3z) - 1) - 5z = -68
  -- Simplify the equation: 3(10 - 3z) - 5z = -68
  -- Distribute and combine like terms: 30 - 9z - 5z = -68
  -- Combine like terms: 30 - 14z = -68
  -- Solve for z: 30 + 68 = 14z, which simplifies to 98 = 14z, thus z = 7
  -- Substitute z = 7 back into f = 11 - 3z: f = 11 - 3 * 7, which simplifies to f = 11 - 21, thus f = -10
