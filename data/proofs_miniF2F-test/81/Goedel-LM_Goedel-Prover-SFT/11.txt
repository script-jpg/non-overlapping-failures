  Given the equations \( f + 3z = 11 \) and \( 3(f - 1) - 5z = -68 \), we need to show that \( f = -10 \) and \( z = 7 \).
  1. Start by rewriting the equations in a standard form.
  2. Use algebraic manipulation to isolate \( f \) and \( z \).
  3. Solve the system of linear equations to find the values of \( f \) and \( z \).
