  Given the equations \( f + 3z = 11 \) and \( 3(f - 1) - 5z = -68 \), we need to show that \( f = -10 \) and \( z = 7 \).
  1. From the first equation \( f + 3z = 11 \), we can express \( f \) as \( f = 11 - 3z \).
  2. Substitute \( f = 11 - 3z \) into the second equation \( 3(f - 1) - 5z = -68 \):
     \[
     3((11 - 3z) - 1) - 5z = -68
     \]
  3. Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
     \[
     3(10 - 3z) - 5z = -68
     \]
  4. Distribute the 3:
     \[
     30 - 9z - 5z = -68
     \]
  5. Combine like terms:
     \[
     30 - 14z = -68
     \]
  6. Solve for \( z \):
     \[
     30 + 68 = 14z \implies 98 = 14z \implies z = 7
     \]
  7. Substitute \( z = 7 \) back into \( f = 11 - 3z \):
     \[
     f = 11 - 3 \cdot 7 = 11 - 21 = -10
     \]
  8. Therefore, \( f = -10 \) and \( z = 7 \).
