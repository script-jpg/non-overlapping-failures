  Given the equations \( f + 3z = 11 \) and \( 3(f - 1) - 5z = -68 \), we need to show that \( f = -10 \) and \( z = 7 \).
  1. From the first equation \( f + 3z = 11 \), we can express \( f \) in terms of \( z \):
     \[
     f = 11 - 3z
     \]
  2. Substitute \( f = 11 - 3z \) into the second equation \( 3(f - 1) - 5z = -68 \):
     \[
     3((11 - 3z) - 1) - 5z = -68
     \]
  3. Simplify the equation:
     \[
     3(10 - 3z) - 5z = -68
     \]
     \[
     30 - 9z - 5z = -68
     \]
     \[
     30 - 14z = -68
     \]
  4. Solve for \( z \):
     \[
     30 + 68 = 14z
     \]
     \[
     98 = 14z
     \]
     \[
     z = 7
     \]
  5. Substitute \( z = 7 \) back into \( f = 11 - 3z \):
     \[
     f = 11 - 3 \cdot 7
     \]
     \[
     f = 11 - 21
     \]
     \[
     f = -10
     \]
  Thus, we have shown that \( f = -10 \) and \( z = 7 \).

  -- From the first equation, express f in terms of z: f = 11 - 3z
  have h₂ : f = 11 - 3 * z := by linear_combination h₀
  -- Substitute f = 11 - 3z into the second equation and simplify
  have h₃ : 3 * (f - 1) - 5 * z = -68 := by linear_combination h₁
  rw [h₂] at h₃
  -- Solve for z: 30 - 14z = -68
  have h₄ : z = 7 := by linear_combination h₃
  -- Substitute z = 7 back into f = 11 - 3z to find f
  have h₅ : f = -10 := by linear_combination h₂
  -- Conclude the proof
