  Given the equations \( f + 3z = 11 \) and \( 3(f - 1) - 5z = -68 \), we need to show that \( f = -10 \) and \( z = 7 \).
  1. Start by isolating \( f \) in the first equation:
     \[
     f + 3z = 11 \implies f = 11 - 3z
     \]
  2. Substitute \( f = 11 - 3z \) into the second equation:
     \[
     3((11 - 3z) - 1) - 5z = -68
     \]
  3. Simplify the equation:
     \[
     3(10 - 3z) - 5z = -68 \implies 30 - 9z - 5z = -68 \implies 30 - 14z = -68
     \]
  4. Solve for \( z \):
     \[
     30 - 14z = -68 \implies 14z = 98 \implies z = 7
     \]
  5. Substitute \( z = 7 \) back into \( f = 11 - 3z \):
     \[
     f = 11 - 3(7) \implies f = 11 - 21 \implies f = -10
     \]
  6. Therefore, \( f = -10 \) and \( z = 7 \).
