  Given the equations \( f + 3z = 11 \) and \( 3(f - 1) - 5z = -68 \), we need to show that \( f = -10 \) and \( z = 7 \).
  1. Start by isolating \( f \) in the first equation: \( f = 11 - 3z \).
  2. Substitute \( f = 11 - 3z \) into the second equation: \( 3((11 - 3z) - 1) - 5z = -68 \).
  3. Simplify the equation: \( 3(10 - 3z) - 5z = -68 \).
  4. Distribute and combine like terms: \( 30 - 9z - 5z = -68 \).
  5. Combine like terms: \( 30 - 14z = -68 \).
  6. Isolate \( z \): \( 14z = 98 \).
  7. Solve for \( z \): \( z = 7 \).
  8. Substitute \( z = 7 \) back into \( f = 11 - 3z \): \( f = 11 - 3 \cdot 7 = 11 - 21 = -10 \).
  Thus, \( f = -10 \) and \( z = 7 \).
