  Given the equations \( f + 3z = 11 \) and \( 3(f - 1) - 5z = -68 \), we need to show that \( f = -10 \) and \( z = 7 \).
  1. Start by solving the first equation for \( f \):
     \[
     f + 3z = 11 \implies f = 11 - 3z
     \]
  2. Substitute \( f = 11 - 3z \) into the second equation:
     \[
     3((11 - 3z) - 1) - 5z = -68
     \]
  3. Simplify the equation:
     \[
     3(10 - 3z) - 5z = -68 \implies 30 - 9z - 5z = -68 \implies 30 - 14z = -68
     \]
  4. Solve for \( z \):
     \[
     30 - 14z = -68 \implies 14z = 98 \implies z = 7
     \]
  5. Substitute \( z = 7 \) back into \( f = 11 - 3z \):
     \[
     f = 11 - 3(7) \implies f = 11 - 21 \implies f = -10
     \]
  Thus, we have shown that \( f = -10 \) and \( z = 7 \).

  -- Solve for f using the first equation and the second equation
  have h₂ : f = -10 := by
    -- Use linear arithmetic to solve for f
    linear_combination h₀ + h₁
  have h₃ : z = 7 := by
    -- Use linear arithmetic to solve for z
    linear_combination h₀ - h₁
  -- Combine the results to get the final answer
  exact ⟨h₂, h₃⟩
