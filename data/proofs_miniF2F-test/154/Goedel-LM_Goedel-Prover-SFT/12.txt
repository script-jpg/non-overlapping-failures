  To find the value of \( x \) that minimizes the quadratic expression \( x^2 - 14x + 3 \), we start by rewriting the expression in a form that makes it easier to identify the minimum value. We complete the square for the quadratic part of the expression.
  First, consider the expression \( x^2 - 14x + 3 \). We can rewrite this as:
  \[ x^2 - 14x + 3 = (x - 7)^2 - 49 + 3 \]
  \[ = (x - 7)^2 - 46 \]
  Next, observe that the term \( (x - 7)^2 \) is always non-negative because it is a square of a real number. Therefore, the minimum value of \( (x - 7)^2 \) is 0, which occurs when \( x = 7 \).
  Substituting \( x = 7 \) into the expression, we get:
  \[ (7 - 7)^2 - 46 = 0 - 46 = -46 \]
  Thus, the minimum value of the expression \( x^2 - 14x + 3 \) is \(-46\), and it is achieved when \( x = 7 \).
