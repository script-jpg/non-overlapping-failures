  To determine the value of \( x \) that minimizes the quadratic expression \( x^2 - 14x + 3 \), we start by rewriting the expression in a form that makes it easier to identify the minimum value. We complete the square for the quadratic term \( x^2 - 14x \).
  First, we rewrite \( x^2 - 14x \) by factoring out the coefficient of \( x \):
  \[ x^2 - 14x = (x - 7)^2 - 49 \]
  Thus, the original expression \( x^2 - 14x + 3 \) becomes:
  \[ (x - 7)^2 - 49 + 3 = (x - 7)^2 - 46 \]
  Since \((x - 7)^2\) is always non-negative (i.e., \((x - 7)^2 \geq 0\)), the minimum value of \((x - 7)^2 - 46\) occurs when \((x - 7)^2 = 0\). Therefore, the minimum value of the expression is:
  \[ 0 - 46 = -46 \]
  This occurs when \( x = 7 \).

  -- We use the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative to show that the expression is always at least -46 when x = 7.
  linarith [sq_nonneg (x - 7), sq_nonneg (x + 7), sq_nonneg (x - 4), sq_nonneg (x + 4)]
  -- The `linarith` tactic is used to solve linear arithmetic problems. Here, it uses the non-negativity of squares to establish the inequality.
  -- Specifically, it uses the fact that (x - 7)^2, (x + 7)^2, (x - 4)^2, and (x + 4)^2 are all non-negative to prove the inequality.
  <;> simp [sq, mul_comm]
  -- The `simp` tactic is used to simplify the expression using the definition of squaring and the commutativity of multiplication.
  -- The `mul_comm` lemma is used to rewrite multiplication in a commutative form, which helps in simplifying the expression.
  <;> ring
  -- The `ring` tactic is used to simplify the expression by expanding and combining like terms.
  -- This step ensures that the expression is in its simplest form.
  <;> linarith
  -- The `linarith` tactic is used again to confirm that the simplified expression is indeed at least -46.
