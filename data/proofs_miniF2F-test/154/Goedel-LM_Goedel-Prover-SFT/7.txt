  To show that the value of \( x \) that minimizes the expression \( x^2 - 14x + 3 \) is \( x = 7 \), we start by rewriting the expression in a form that makes it easier to identify the minimum value. We complete the square for the quadratic term \( x^2 - 14x \).
  First, we rewrite \( x^2 - 14x \) by factoring out 1 from the quadratic expression:
  \[ x^2 - 14x = (x - 7)^2 - 49 \]
  Next, we substitute this back into the original expression:
  \[ x^2 - 14x + 3 = (x - 7)^2 - 49 + 3 \]
  Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:
  \[ (x - 7)^2 - 46 \]
  Since \((x - 7)^2\) is always non-negative (i.e., \((x - 7)^2 \geq 0\)), the minimum value of \((x - 7)^2 - 46\) occurs when \((x - 7)^2 = 0\). Therefore, the minimum value of the expression is:
  \[ 0 - 46 = -46 \]
  Thus, the minimum value of \( x^2 - 14x + 3 \) is \(-46\), which occurs when \( x = 7 \).
