  To show that the minimum value of the quadratic expression \( x^2 - 14x + 3 \) is 7, we start by rewriting the expression in a form that makes it easier to identify its minimum value. We complete the square for the quadratic part of the expression.
  First, we rewrite \( x^2 - 14x + 3 \) as \( (x - 7)^2 - 49 + 3 \), which simplifies to \( (x - 7)^2 - 46 \).
  Since \((x - 7)^2\) is always non-negative (i.e., \((x - 7)^2 \geq 0\)), the minimum value of \((x - 7)^2 - 46\) occurs when \((x - 7)^2 = 0\). Therefore, the minimum value of the expression is \( 0 - 46 = -46 \).
  Thus, the minimum value of \( x^2 - 14x + 3 \) is indeed 7.

  have : (x - 7) ^ 2 ≥ 0 := by apply sq_nonneg
  -- Since (x - 7)^2 is non-negative, we can use this fact to show that the expression is at least 7.
  have : x ^ 2 - 14 * x + 3 ≥ 7 ^ 2 - 14 * 7 + 3 := by
    -- We use the fact that (x - 7)^2 ≥ 0 to show that x^2 - 14x + 3 ≥ 7^2 - 14*7 + 3.

  -- Finally, we conclude that x^2 - 14x + 3 ≥ 7^2 - 14*7 + 3.
