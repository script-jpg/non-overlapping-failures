  To show that the minimum value of \( x^2 - 14x + 3 \) is achieved when \( x = 7 \), we start by rewriting the expression in a form that makes it easier to identify the minimum value. We can complete the square for the quadratic expression \( x^2 - 14x + 3 \):
  \[ x^2 - 14x + 3 = (x - 7)^2 - 49 + 3 = (x - 7)^2 - 46. \]
  Since the square of any real number is always non-negative, \( (x - 7)^2 \geq 0 \). Therefore, the minimum value of \( (x - 7)^2 - 46 \) is achieved when \( (x - 7)^2 = 0 \), which occurs when \( x = 7 \). Substituting \( x = 7 \) into the expression, we get:
  \[ (7 - 7)^2 - 46 = 0 - 46 = -46. \]
  Thus, the minimum value of \( x^2 - 14x + 3 \) is \(-46\), and it is achieved when \( x = 7 \).
