  To determine the value of \( x \) that minimizes the quadratic expression \( x^2 - 14x + 3 \), we can complete the square. The given expression can be rewritten as:
  \[ x^2 - 14x + 3 = (x - 7)^2 - 49 + 3 = (x - 7)^2 - 46. \]
  Since \((x - 7)^2\) is always non-negative (i.e., \((x - 7)^2 \geq 0\)), the minimum value of \((x - 7)^2 - 46\) occurs when \((x - 7)^2 = 0\), which gives:
  \[ 0 - 46 = -46. \]
  Thus, the minimum value of \( x^2 - 14x + 3 \) is \(-46\), and it occurs when \( x = 7 \).

  -- We need to show that x^2 - 14x + 3 ≥ 7^2 - 14*7 + 3.
  -- This is equivalent to showing (x - 7)^2 ≥ 0, which is always true.
  have : (x - 7) ^ 2 ≥ 0 := by
    -- The square of any real number is non-negative.
    apply sq_nonneg
  -- Using the non-negativity of (x - 7)^2, we can conclude the desired inequality.
