  To show that \( x^2 - 14x + 3 \geq 7^2 - 14 \cdot 7 + 3 \) for any real number \( x \), we start by rewriting the inequality. We observe that the expression \( x^2 - 14x + 3 \) can be rewritten in a form that involves the square of \( x - 7 \). Specifically, we can express \( x^2 - 14x + 3 \) as \( (x - 7)^2 - 49 + 3 \). This simplifies to \( (x - 7)^2 - 46 \). Since the square of any real number is non-negative, \( (x - 7)^2 \geq 0 \), it follows that \( (x - 7)^2 - 46 \geq -46 \). Therefore, \( x^2 - 14x + 3 \geq -46 \), which is always greater than or equal to \( 7^2 - 14 \cdot 7 + 3 \).
