  To determine the value of \( x \) that minimizes the quadratic expression \( x^2 - 14x + 3 \), we start by rewriting the expression in a form that makes it easier to identify the minimum value. We complete the square for the quadratic part of the expression.
  First, consider the expression \( x^2 - 14x + 3 \). We can rewrite this as:
  \[ x^2 - 14x + 3 = (x - 7)^2 - 49 + 3 = (x - 7)^2 - 46. \]
  Since the square of any real number is always non-negative, \( (x - 7)^2 \geq 0 \). Therefore, the minimum value of \( (x - 7)^2 \) is 0, which occurs when \( x = 7 \).
  Substituting \( x = 7 \) into the expression, we get:
  \[ (7 - 7)^2 - 46 = 0 - 46 = -46. \]
  Thus, the minimum value of \( x^2 - 14x + 3 \) is \(-46\), and it occurs when \( x = 7 \).

    -- Rewrite the expression by completing the square.
    -- x^2 - 14x + 3 = (x - 7)^2 - 49 + 3 = (x - 7)^2 - 46
    -- Since (x - 7)^2 is always non-negative, the minimum value of (x - 7)^2 is 0.
    -- Therefore, the minimum value of the expression is -46.
