  To determine the value of \( x \) that minimizes the expression \( x^2 - 14x + 3 \), we start by rewriting the expression in a form that makes it easier to identify the minimum value. We complete the square:
  \[ x^2 - 14x + 3 = (x - 7)^2 - 49 + 3 = (x - 7)^2 - 46. \]
  Since the square of any real number is always non-negative, we have:
  \[ (x - 7)^2 \geq 0. \]
  Thus, the expression \( (x - 7)^2 - 46 \) is minimized when \( (x - 7)^2 = 0 \), which occurs when \( x = 7 \). Substituting \( x = 7 \) into the expression, we get:
  \[ (7 - 7)^2 - 46 = 0 - 46 = -46. \]
  Therefore, the minimum value of \( x^2 - 14x + 3 \) is \(-46\), and it is achieved when \( x = 7 \).
