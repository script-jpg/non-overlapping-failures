  To show that the value of \( x \) that minimizes the quadratic expression \( x^2 - 14x + 3 \) is 7, we need to demonstrate that for any real number \( x \), the expression \( x^2 - 14x + 3 \) is greater than or equal to \( 7^2 - 14 \cdot 7 + 3 \).
  1. Start by rewriting the expression \( 7^2 - 14 \cdot 7 + 3 \) as \( 7^2 - 14 \cdot 7 + 3 \).
  2. Recognize that \( 7^2 - 14 \cdot 7 + 3 \) is a constant value.
  3. Use the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative to show that \( x^2 - 14x + 3 \) is always greater than or equal to \( 7^2 - 14 \cdot 7 + 3 \).

  -- Recognize that 7^2 - 14 * 7 + 3 is a constant value.
  have : 7 ^ 2 - 14 * 7 + 3 = 7 ^ 2 - 14 * 7 + 3 := rfl
  -- Use the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative to show that x^2 - 14x + 3 is always greater than or equal to 7^2 - 14 * 7 + 3.
