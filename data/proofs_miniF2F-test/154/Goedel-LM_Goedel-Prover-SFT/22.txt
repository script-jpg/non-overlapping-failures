  To show that the minimum value of the quadratic expression \( x^2 - 14x + 3 \) is 7, we start by rewriting the expression in a form that makes it easier to identify the minimum value. We complete the square for the quadratic term \( x^2 - 14x \).
  First, we rewrite \( x^2 - 14x \) as \( (x - 7)^2 - 49 \). This transformation shows that:
  \[ x^2 - 14x + 3 = (x - 7)^2 - 49 + 3 \]
  Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:
  \[ (x - 7)^2 - 46 \]
  Since the square of any real number is non-negative, \( (x - 7)^2 \geq 0 \). Therefore, the minimum value of \( (x - 7)^2 - 46 \) is achieved when \( (x - 7)^2 = 0 \), which occurs when \( x = 7 \). At this point, the expression equals \(-46\).
  Thus, the minimum value of \( x^2 - 14x + 3 \) is \(-46\), and it is achieved when \( x = 7 \).
