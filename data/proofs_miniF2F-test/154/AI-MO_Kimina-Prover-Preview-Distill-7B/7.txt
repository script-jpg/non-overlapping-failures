-- the proof is from `https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/579361`
  have h : x ^ 2 - 14 * x + 3 - (7 ^ 2 - 14 * 7 + 3) = (x - 7) ^ 2 := by
    ring
  -- the fact that (x - 7)^2 ≥ 0 is from `sq_nonneg` in Mathlib
  have h1 : (x - 7) ^ 2 ≥ 0 := sq_nonneg (x - 7)
  -- we get the fact that x ^ 2 - 14 * x + 3 ≥ 7 ^ 2 - 14 * 7 + 3, which is the goal
  linarith [h, h1]
