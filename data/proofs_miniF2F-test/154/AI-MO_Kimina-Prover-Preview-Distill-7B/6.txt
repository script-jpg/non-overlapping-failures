-- the minimum value of a quadratic funtion ax^2+bx+c occurs at x = -b/(2a)
  -- Here a=1, b=-14, so the minimum occurs at x = 14/(2*1) = 7.
  have h : (x - 7) ^ 2 ≥ 0 := by
    exact sq_nonneg (x - 7)
  -- expand the expression
  ring_nf
  -- the inequality is equivalent to 0 ≥ 48 - 49
  linarith [sq_nonneg (x - 7)]
