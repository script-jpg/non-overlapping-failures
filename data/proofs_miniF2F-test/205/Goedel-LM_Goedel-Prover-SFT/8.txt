  To prove the inequality \((\frac{a+b}{2})^n \leq \frac{a^n+b^n}{2}\) for positive real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) and a positive integer \(n\), we can use the properties of non-negative real numbers and the binomial theorem. Specifically, we can use the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative, which implies that the sum of powers of non-negative numbers is also non-negative. By applying these properties, we can derive the desired inequality.
