  We need to show that for any positive real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) and a positive integer \(n\), the inequality \(\left(\frac{a + b}{2}\right)^n \leq \frac{a^n + b^n}{2}\) holds.
  1. **Base Case (n = 1):**
     - When \(n = 1\), the inequality simplifies to \(\left(\frac{a + b}{2}\right)^1 \leq \frac{a^1 + b^1}{2}\), which is equivalent to \(\frac{a + b}{2} \leq \frac{a + b}{2}\). This is trivially true.
  2. **Inductive Step:**
     - Assume the inequality holds for some \(n\), i.e., \(\left(\frac{a + b}{2}\right)^n \leq \frac{a^n + b^n}{2}\).
     - We need to show it holds for \(n + 1\).
     - Consider \(\left(\frac{a + b}{2}\right)^{n+1} = \left(\frac{a + b}{2}\right)^n \cdot \frac{a + b}{2}\).
     - By the inductive hypothesis, \(\left(\frac{a + b}{2}\right)^n \leq \frac{a^n + b^n}{2}\).
     - Therefore, \(\left(\frac{a + b}{2}\right)^{n+1} \leq \frac{a^n + b^n}{2} \cdot \frac{a + b}{2} = \frac{a^{n+1} + b^{n+1}}{2}\).
  Thus, by induction, the inequality holds for all positive integers \(n\).
