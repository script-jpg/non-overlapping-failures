  We need to show that for any positive real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) and a positive integer \(n\), the inequality \(\left(\frac{a + b}{2}\right)^n \leq \frac{a^n + b^n}{2}\) holds.
  1. **Base Case (n = 0):**
     - When \(n = 0\), \(\left(\frac{a + b}{2}\right)^0 = 1\) and \(\frac{a^0 + b^0}{2} = \frac{1 + 1}{2} = 1\). Thus, \(1 \leq 1\), which is true.
  2. **Inductive Step:**
     - Assume the inequality holds for some \(n\), i.e., \(\left(\frac{a + b}{2}\right)^n \leq \frac{a^n + b^n}{2}\). We need to show it holds for \(n + 1\).
     - Consider \(\left(\frac{a + b}{2}\right)^{n+1} = \left(\frac{a + b}{2}\right)^n \cdot \frac{a + b}{2}\). By the inductive hypothesis, \(\left(\frac{a + b}{2}\right)^n \leq \frac{a^n + b^n}{2}\), so
       \[
       \left(\frac{a + b}{2}\right)^{n+1} \leq \frac{a^n + b^n}{2} \cdot \frac{a + b}{2} = \frac{a^{n+1} + b^{n+1}}{2}.
       \]
     - Thus, the inequality holds for \(n + 1\).
  By induction, the inequality \(\left(\frac{a + b}{2}\right)^n \leq \frac{a^n + b^n}{2}\) holds for all positive integers \(n\).
