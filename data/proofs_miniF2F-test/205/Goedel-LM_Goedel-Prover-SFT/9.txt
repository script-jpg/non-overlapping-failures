  We need to show that for any positive real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) and a positive integer \(n\), the inequality \(\left(\frac{a + b}{2}\right)^n \leq \frac{a^n + b^n}{2}\) holds.
  1. **Base Case**: When \(n = 1\), the inequality simplifies to \(\left(\frac{a + b}{2}\right) \leq \frac{a + b}{2}\), which is trivially true.
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the inequality holds for some \(n\). We need to show it holds for \(n + 1\).
     - Using the binomial theorem, we expand \(\left(\frac{a + b}{2}\right)^{n+1}\).
     - By the inductive hypothesis, we know that \(\left(\frac{a + b}{2}\right)^n \leq \frac{a^n + b^n}{2}\).
     - Using the properties of powers and the fact that \(\left(\frac{a + b}{2}\right) \leq \frac{a + b}{2}\), we can derive the desired inequality for \(n + 1\).
