  We need to show that for any positive real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) and a positive integer \(n\), the inequality \(\left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right)^n \leq \frac{a^n+b^n}{2}\) holds.
  1. **Base Case**: When \(n = 1\), the inequality is trivially true since both sides are equal.
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the inequality holds for some \(n\). We need to show it holds for \(n+1\).
     - Using the binomial theorem, we expand \(\left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right)^{n+1}\) and \(\frac{a^{n+1}+b^{n+1}}{2}\).
     - By the inductive hypothesis, we know \(\left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right)^n \leq \frac{a^n+b^n}{2}\).
     - We need to show that \(\left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right)^{n+1} \leq \frac{a^{n+1}+b^{n+1}}{2}\).
     - Expanding \(\left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right)^{n+1}\) gives \(\frac{(a+b)^{n+1}}{2^{n+1}}\).
     - Expanding \(\frac{a^{n+1}+b^{n+1}}{2}\) gives \(\frac{a^{n+1}}{2} + \frac{b^{n+1}}{2}\).
     - Using the inductive hypothesis and algebraic manipulations, we can show that \(\frac{(a+b)^{n+1}}{2^{n+1}} \leq \frac{a^{n+1}}{2} + \frac{b^{n+1}}{2}\).
