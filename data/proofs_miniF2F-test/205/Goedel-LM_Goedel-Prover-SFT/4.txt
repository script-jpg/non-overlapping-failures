  We need to show that for two positive real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) and a positive integer \(n\), the inequality \(\left(\frac{a + b}{2}\right)^n \leq \frac{a^n + b^n}{2}\) holds.
  1. **Base Case**: When \(n = 1\), the inequality simplifies to \(\left(\frac{a + b}{2}\right)^1 \leq \frac{a + b}{2}\), which is trivially true.
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the inequality holds for some \(n = k\), i.e., \(\left(\frac{a + b}{2}\right)^k \leq \frac{a^k + b^k}{2}\). We need to show it holds for \(n = k + 1\).
     - Consider \(\left(\frac{a + b}{2}\right)^{k+1}\). This can be rewritten as \(\left(\frac{a + b}{2}\right)^k \cdot \frac{a + b}{2}\).
     - By the inductive hypothesis, \(\left(\frac{a + b}{2}\right)^k \leq \frac{a^k + b^k}{2}\).
     - Therefore, \(\left(\frac{a + b}{2}\right)^{k+1} \leq \frac{a^k + b^k}{2} \cdot \frac{a + b}{2} = \frac{a^{k+1} + b^{k+1}}{2}\).
  Thus, by induction, the inequality holds for all positive integers \(n\).
