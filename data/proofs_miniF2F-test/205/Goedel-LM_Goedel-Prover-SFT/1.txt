  We need to show that for any positive real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) and a positive integer \(n\), the inequality \(\left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right)^n \leq \frac{a^n + b^n}{2}\) holds.
  1. **Base Case (n = 1):**
     - When \(n = 1\), the inequality simplifies to \(\left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right) \leq \frac{a + b}{2}\), which is trivially true.
  2. **Inductive Step:**
     - Assume the inequality holds for some positive integer \(n\). We need to show it holds for \(n + 1\).
     - Consider \(\left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right)^{n+1}\). By the properties of exponents and the arithmetic mean-geometric mean inequality (AM-GM), we have:
       \[
       \left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right)^{n+1} = \left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right)^n \cdot \frac{a+b}{2}
       \]
     - Using the inductive hypothesis \(\left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right)^n \leq \frac{a^n + b^n}{2}\), we get:
       \[
       \left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right)^{n+1} \leq \frac{a^n + b^n}{2} \cdot \frac{a+b}{2} = \frac{(a^n + b^n)(a + b)}{4}
       \]
     - We need to show:
       \[
       \frac{(a^n + b^n)(a + b)}{4} \leq \frac{a^{n+1} + b^{n+1}}{2}
       \]
     - By the AM-GM inequality, we have:
       \[
       a^{n+1} + b^{n+1} \geq 2 \sqrt{a^{n+1} \cdot b^{n+1}} = 2 \left(\frac{a \cdot b}{2}\right)^{n+1} = a^{n+1} \cdot b^{n+1}
       \]
     - Since \(a\) and \(b\) are positive, we can conclude that:
       \[
       \frac{(a^n + b^n)(a + b)}{4} \leq \frac{a^{n+1} \cdot b^{n+1}}{2}
       \]
     - Therefore, \(\left(\frac{a+b}{2}\right)^{n+1} \leq \frac{a^{n+1} + b^{n+1}}{2}\), completing the inductive step.
  By induction, the inequality holds for all positive integers \(n\).
