  have h'' : 0 ≤ (a + b) / 2 := by linarith
  -- Use the weighted AM-GM inequality to prove the inequality.
  have h₁' : ((a + b) / 2) ^ n ≤ (a ^ n + b ^ n) / 2 := by
    -- Apply the weighted AM-GM inequality.
    have h₂ : 0 ≤ a ^ n := by positivity
    have h₃ : 0 ≤ b ^ n := by positivity
    have h₄ : 0 ≤ (a ^ n + b ^ n) / 2 := by positivity
    -- Use the fact that the nth power of the average is less than or equal to the average of the nth powers.
    have h₅ : ((a + b) / 2) ^ n ≤ (a ^ n + b ^ n) / 2 := by
      -- Use the weighted AM-GM inequality for the nth powers.
