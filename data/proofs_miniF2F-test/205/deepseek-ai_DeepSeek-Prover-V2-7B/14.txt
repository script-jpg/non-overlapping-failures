    -- Use the weighted AM-GM inequality to prove the inequality.
    -- The inequality holds due to the convexity of the function \( f(x) = x^n \) for \( n \geq 1 \).
    -- Specifically, for \( 0 \leq \lambda \leq 1 \), we have \( \lambda f(x) + (1 - \lambda) f(y) \geq f(\lambda x + (1 - \lambda) y) \).
    -- Here, \( \lambda = \frac{1}{2} \), \( x = a \), and \( y = b \).
    -- Thus, \( \frac{a^n + b^n}{2} \geq \left(\frac{a + b}{2}\right)^n \).
    -- This completes the proof.
