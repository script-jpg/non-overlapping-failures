    -- Use the fact that the nth power of the average is less than or equal to the average of the nth powers for n ≥ 1
    -- This is a consequence of the convexity of the function x^n for n ≥ 1
    -- We use the weighted AM-GM inequality to prove this
    -- The weight given to a^n and b^n is 1/2 each
    -- This can be generalized to any number of terms and any weights summing to 1
    -- Here, we have two terms and a weight of 1/2 each
    -- We use the fact that the nth power function is convex for n ≥ 1
    -- This means that the nth power of the average is less than or equal to the average of the nth powers
