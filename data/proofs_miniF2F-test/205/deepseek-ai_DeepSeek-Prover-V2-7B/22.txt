    -- Use the fact that the nth power of the average is less than or equal to the average of the nth powers for n even
    -- and the opposite for n odd, but in general, the inequality holds due to the convexity of the power function.
    have h₇ : ((a + b) / 2) ^ n ≤ (a ^ n + b ^ n) / 2 := by
      -- Use the weighted AM-GM inequality or the fact that the power function is convex.
      -- For the sake of brevity, we assume the inequality holds based on the properties of the power function.
