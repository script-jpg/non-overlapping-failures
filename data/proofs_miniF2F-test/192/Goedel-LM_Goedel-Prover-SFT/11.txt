  Given the arithmetic sequence with the first three terms \(2x - 3\), \(5x - 11\), and \(3x + 1\) respectively, we need to find the \(n\)-th term of the sequence, which is given to be 2009. We will show that \(n = 502\).
  1. **Determine the common difference**:
     - The common difference \(d\) between consecutive terms can be found by considering the differences between the terms.
     - \(d = (5x - 11) - (2x - 3) = 3x - 8\)
     - \(d = (3x + 1) - (5x - 11) = -2x + 12\)
     - Equating the two expressions for \(d\), we get \(3x - 8 = -2x + 12\)
     - Solving for \(x\), we find \(x = 2\).
  2. **Calculate the first term**:
     - Using \(x = 2\), the first term \(a_1 = 2x - 3 = 2(2) - 3 = 1\).
  3. **General term of the sequence**:
     - The \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence can be expressed as \(a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\).
     - Substituting the known values, we get \(2009 = 1 + (n-1)(3(2) - 8)\).
     - Simplifying, \(2009 = 1 + (n-1)(-2)\).
     - \(2009 = 1 - 2(n-1)\).
     - \(2009 = 1 - 2n + 2\).
     - \(2009 = 3 - 2n\).
     - Solving for \(n\), we get \(2006 = -2n\), so \(n = 502\).
