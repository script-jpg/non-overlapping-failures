  Given an arithmetic sequence with the first three terms \(2x - 3\), \(5x - 11\), and \(3x + 1\), we need to find the \(n\)th term of the sequence, which is given as \(2009\). We need to determine the value of \(n\).
  First, we calculate the common difference \(d\) of the arithmetic sequence. The common difference is the difference between any two consecutive terms.
  \[ d = (5x - 11) - (2x - 3) = 3x - 8 \]
  \[ d = (3x + 1) - (5x - 11) = -2x + 12 \]
  Since the common difference must be the same between any two consecutive terms, we equate the two expressions for \(d\):
  \[ 3x - 8 = -2x + 12 \]
  Solving for \(x\):
  \[ 3x + 2x = 12 + 8 \]
  \[ 5x = 20 \]
  \[ x = 4 \]
  Now, we substitute \(x = 4\) back into the expressions for the first three terms to verify the common difference:
  \[ a_1 = 2(4) - 3 = 8 - 3 = 5 \]
  \[ a_2 = 5(4) - 11 = 20 - 11 = 9 \]
  \[ a_3 = 3(4) + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13 \]
  The common difference \(d\) is:
  \[ d = a_2 - a_1 = 9 - 5 = 4 \]
  \[ d = a_3 - a_2 = 13 - 9 = 4 \]
  Thus, the common difference \(d\) is indeed \(4\).
  Next, we use the formula for the \(n\)th term of an arithmetic sequence:
  \[ a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d \]
  Substituting the known values:
  \[ 2009 = 5 + (n - 1) \cdot 4 \]
  \[ 2009 = 5 + 4n - 4 \]
  \[ 2009 = 4n + 1 \]
  Solving for \(n\):
  \[ 2009 - 1 = 4n \]
  \[ 2008 = 4n \]
  \[ n = \frac{2008}{4} \]
  \[ n = 502 \]
  Therefore, the value of \(n\) is \(502\).
