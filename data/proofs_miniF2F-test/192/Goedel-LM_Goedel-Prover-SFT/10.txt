  Given the arithmetic sequence with the first three terms \(2x - 3\), \(5x - 11\), and \(3x + 1\), we need to determine the value of \(n\) such that the \(n\)th term of the sequence is 2009. We are provided with the following conditions:
  - The first term \(a_1 = 2x - 3\).
  - The second term \(a_2 = 5x - 11\).
  - The third term \(a_3 = 3x + 1\).
  - The \(n\)th term \(a_n = 2009\).
  To find \(n\), we use the property of the arithmetic sequence that the difference between consecutive terms is constant. This property allows us to express the terms in terms of the first term and the common difference. By simplifying the given terms and using the property of the sequence, we can derive the value of \(n\).
