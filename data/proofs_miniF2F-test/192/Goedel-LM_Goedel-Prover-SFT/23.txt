  Given the first three terms of an arithmetic sequence are \(2x - 3\), \(5x - 11\), and \(3x + 1\) respectively, and the \(n\)th term of the sequence is \(2009\), we need to determine \(n\).
  First, we calculate the common difference \(d\) of the arithmetic sequence:
  \[ d = a_2 - a_1 = (5x - 11) - (2x - 3) = 3x - 8 \]
  \[ d = a_3 - a_2 = (3x + 1) - (5x - 11) = -2x + 12 \]
  Since the sequence is arithmetic, the common difference \(d\) must be consistent. We solve for \(x\) using the first two terms:
  \[ 3x - 8 = -2x + 12 \]
  \[ 5x = 20 \]
  \[ x = 4 \]
  Now, we calculate the first term \(a_1\):
  \[ a_1 = 2x - 3 = 2(4) - 3 = 8 - 3 = 5 \]
  The common difference \(d\) is:
  \[ d = 3(4) - 8 = 12 - 8 = 4 \]
  The \(n\)th term of the sequence is given by:
  \[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \]
  Given \(a_n = 2009\), we solve for \(n\):
  \[ 2009 = 5 + (n-1) \cdot 4 \]
  \[ 2009 = 5 + 4n - 4 \]
  \[ 2009 = 4n + 1 \]
  \[ 2008 = 4n \]
  \[ n = 502 \]
  Thus, the value of \(n\) is \(502\).
