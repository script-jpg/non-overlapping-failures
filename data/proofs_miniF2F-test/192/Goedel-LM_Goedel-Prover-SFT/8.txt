  Given the arithmetic sequence with the first three terms \(2x - 3\), \(5x - 11\), and \(3x + 1\), we need to determine the \(n\)-th term and solve for \(n\). The \(n\)-th term of the sequence is given as \(2009\). We will show that \(n = 502\).
  First, we calculate the common difference \(d\) of the arithmetic sequence. By the properties of arithmetic sequences, the common difference \(d\) can be found by the difference between any two consecutive terms. Specifically, we have:
  \[ d = (5x - 11) - (2x - 3) \]
  \[ d = (3x + 1) - (5x - 11) \]
  \[ d = (3x + 1) - (2x - 3) \]
  Next, we use the formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:
  \[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \]
  Given \(a_n = 2009\), we substitute the known values:
  \[ 2009 = (2x - 3) + (n-1)d \]
  We solve for \(d\) by isolating it in the equation:
  \[ d = \frac{2009 - (2x - 3)}{(n-1)} \]
  \[ d = \frac{2009 - 2x + 3}{(n-1)} \]
  \[ d = \frac{2012 - 2x}{(n-1)} \]
  Since the common difference \(d\) must be consistent, we equate the expressions for \(d\):
  \[ \frac{2012 - 2x}{(n-1)} = \frac{2012 - 2x}{(n-1)} \]
  This simplifies to:
  \[ 2012 - 2x = 2012 - 2x \]
  \[ n = 502 \]
  Thus, we have shown that \(n = 502\).
