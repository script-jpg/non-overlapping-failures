  Given the arithmetic sequence \(a_n\) where the first three terms are \(2x - 3\), \(5x - 11\), and \(3x + 1\) respectively, and the \(n\)th term of the sequence is \(2009\), we need to determine \(n\).
  First, we establish that the common difference \(d\) of the arithmetic sequence is constant. Using the given terms, we can express \(a_2\) and \(a_3\) in terms of \(a_1\) and \(d\):
  \[ a_2 = a_1 + d \]
  \[ a_3 = a_1 + 2d \]
  Given \(a_1 = 2x - 3\), \(a_2 = 5x - 11\), and \(a_3 = 3x + 1\), we can solve for \(d\):
  \[ 5x - 11 = (2x - 3) + d \]
  \[ d = 3x - 8 \]
  \[ 3x + 1 = (2x - 3) + 2d \]
  \[ 2d = 5x + 4 \]
  \[ d = \frac{5x + 4}{2} \]
  Equating the two expressions for \(d\):
  \[ 3x - 8 = \frac{5x + 4}{2} \]
  \[ 6x - 16 = 5x + 4 \]
  \[ x = 20 \]
  Now, we use the common difference \(d\) to find \(a_n\):
  \[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \]
  \[ 2009 = (2x - 3) + (n-1)d \]
  Substituting \(x = 20\) and \(d = \frac{5 \cdot 20 + 4}{2} = 52\):
  \[ 2009 = (2 \cdot 20 - 3) + (n-1) \cdot 52 \]
  \[ 2009 = 37 + (n-1) \cdot 52 \]
  \[ 2009 = 37 + 52n - 52 \]
  \[ 2009 = 52n - 14 \]
  \[ 2023 = 52n \]
  \[ n = \frac{2023}{52} = 502 \]
  Thus, the value of \(n\) is \(502\).
