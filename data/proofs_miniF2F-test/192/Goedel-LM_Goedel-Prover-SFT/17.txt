  Given the first three terms of an arithmetic sequence are \(2x - 3\), \(5x - 11\), and \(3x + 1\) respectively, and the \(n\)th term of the sequence is \(2009\), we need to determine \(n\).
  1. From the given terms, we can derive the common difference \(d\) of the arithmetic sequence.
  2. Using the property of arithmetic sequences, we can express the \(n\)th term in terms of the first term and the common difference.
  3. Given the \(n\)th term is \(2009\), we can set up the equation:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
     \]
  4. Substituting the known values and solving for \(n\), we find that \(n = 502\).
