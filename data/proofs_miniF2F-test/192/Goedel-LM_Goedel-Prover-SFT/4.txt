  Given the first three terms of an arithmetic sequence are \(2x - 3\), \(5x - 11\), and \(3x + 1\) respectively, and the \(n\)th term of the sequence is \(2009\), we need to determine \(n\).
  1. **Common Difference Calculation**:
     - The common difference \(d\) between consecutive terms can be found using the first three terms.
     - From \(a_2 = 5x - 11\) and \(a_1 = 2x - 3\), we get \(d = a_2 - a_1 = (5x - 11) - (2x - 3) = 3x - 8\).
     - From \(a_3 = 3x + 1\) and \(a_2 = 5x - 11\), we get \(d = a_3 - a_2 = (3x + 1) - (5x - 11) = -2x + 12\).
  2. **Equating the Common Diffs**:
     - Since the common difference must be the same for all terms, we equate the expressions for \(d\):
       \[
       3x - 8 = -2x + 12
       \]
     - Solving for \(x\):
       \[
       3x + 2x = 12 + 8 \implies 5x = 20 \implies x = 4
       \]
  3. **Finding the \(n\)th Term**:
     - Using the common difference \(d = 3x - 8\) with \(x = 4\):
       \[
       d = 3(4) - 8 = 12 - 8 = 4
       \]
     - The general form of the \(n\)th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
       \[
       a_n = a_1 + (n - 1) \cdot d
       \]
     - Given \(a_n = 2009\), we solve for \(n\):
       \[
       2009 = 2x - 3 + (n - 1) \cdot (3x - 8)
       \]
     - Substituting \(x = 4\):
       \[
       2009 = 2(4) - 3 + (n - 1) \cdot (3(4) - 8) = 8 - 3 + (n - 1) \cdot 4 = 5 + 4(n - 1)
       \]
     - Solving for \(n\):
       \[
       2009 = 5 + 4(n - 1) \implies 2004 = 4(n - 1) \implies n - 1 = 501 \implies n = 502
       \]
