  Given the first three terms of an arithmetic sequence are \(2x - 3\), \(5x - 11\), and \(3x + 1\) respectively, and the \(n\)th term of the sequence is \(2009\), we need to determine \(n\).
  1. **Determine the common difference**:
     - The common difference \(d\) can be found by the difference between any two consecutive terms.
     - Using the first two terms:
       \[
       d = (5x - 11) - (2x - 3) = 3x - 8
       \]
     - Using the second and third terms:
       \[
       d = (3x + 1) - (5x - 11) = -2x + 12
       \]
     - Equating the two expressions for \(d\):
       \[
       3x - 8 = -2x + 12 \implies 5x = 20 \implies x = 4
       \]
  2. **Calculate the first term**:
     - Using \(x = 4\), the first term \(a_1\) is:
       \[
       a_1 = 2(4) - 3 = 8 - 3 = 5
       \]
  3. **Find the common difference**:
     - Substituting \(x = 4\) into the common difference expression:
       \[
       d = 3(4) - 8 = 12 - 8 = 4
       \]
  4. **General term of the sequence**:
     - The \(n\)th term of an arithmetic sequence can be written as:
       \[
       a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
       \]
     - Given \(a_n = 2009\), we solve for \(n\):
       \[
       2009 = 5 + (n-1) \cdot 4 \implies 2009 = 5 + 4n - 4 \implies 2009 = 4n + 1 \implies 2008 = 4n \implies n = 502
       \]
  Thus, the value of \(n\) is \(502\).
