  Given the first three terms of an arithmetic sequence are \(2x - 3\), \(5x - 11\), and \(3x + 1\) respectively, and the \(n\)th term of the sequence is \(2009\), we need to determine \(n\).
  1. From the given terms, we can set up the following relationships:
     \[
     a_2 - a_1 = a_3 - a_2
     \]
     Substituting the given values:
     \[
     (5x - 11) - (2x - 3) = (3x + 1) - (5x - 11)
     \]
     Simplifying both sides:
     \[
     3x - 8 = -2x + 12
     \]
     Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     3x + 2x = 12 + 8 \implies 5x = 20 \implies x = 4
     \]
  2. Using the value of \(x\), we can find the common difference \(d\) of the arithmetic sequence:
     \[
     d = a_2 - a_1 = (5x - 11) - (2x - 3) = 3x - 8 = 3(4) - 8 = 12 - 8 = 4
     \]
  3. The \(n\)th term of an arithmetic sequence can be expressed as:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
     \]
     Substituting \(a_1 = 2x - 3\) and \(d = 4\):
     \[
     a_n = (2x - 3) + (n-1) \cdot 4 = 2x - 3 + 4n - 4 = 4n + 2x - 7
     \]
     Given \(a_n = 2009\):
     \[
     4n + 2x - 7 = 2009 \implies 4n + 2(4) - 7 = 2009 \implies 4n + 8 - 7 = 2009 \implies 4n + 1 = 2009 \implies 4n = 2008 \implies n = 502
     \]
  Thus, the value of \(n\) is \(502\).
