  Given an arithmetic sequence with the first three terms \(2x - 3\), \(5x - 11\), and \(3x + 1\), and the \(n\)th term of the sequence being 2009, we need to determine \(n\).
  First, we express the common difference \(d\) of the arithmetic sequence using the given terms. By definition, the common difference \(d\) is given by:
  \[ d = a_2 - a_1 \]
  \[ d = a_3 - a_2 \]
  Substituting the given values:
  \[ d = (5x - 11) - (2x - 3) = 3x - 8 \]
  \[ d = (3x + 1) - (5x - 11) = -2x + 12 \]
  Since the common difference must be the same for all terms, we equate the two expressions for \(d\):
  \[ 3x - 8 = -2x + 12 \]
  Solving for \(x\):
  \[ 3x + 2x = 12 + 8 \]
  \[ 5x = 20 \]
  \[ x = 4 \]
  Now, we use the value of \(x\) to find the first term \(a_1\) and the common difference \(d\):
  \[ a_1 = 2x - 3 = 2(4) - 3 = 5 \]
  \[ d = 3x - 8 = 3(4) - 8 = 4 \]
  The \(n\)th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
  \[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \]
  Substituting the known values:
  \[ 2009 = 5 + (n-1) \cdot 4 \]
  \[ 2009 = 5 + 4n - 4 \]
  \[ 2009 = 4n + 1 \]
  Solving for \(n\):
  \[ 2009 - 1 = 4n \]
  \[ 2008 = 4n \]
  \[ n = \frac{2008}{4} \]
  \[ n = 502 \]
  Thus, the value of \(n\) is \(\boxed{502}\).
