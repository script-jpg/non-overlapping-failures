  Given the arithmetic sequence with the first three terms \(2x - 3\), \(5x - 11\), and \(3x + 1\), we need to determine the \(n\)th term of the sequence and show that it equals 2009. By solving for \(x\) from the given terms, we can then compute the \(n\)th term and verify it matches the given value.
