  Given the arithmetic sequence with the first three terms \(2x - 3\), \(5x - 11\), and \(3x + 1\), we need to find the \(n\)th term and set it equal to 2009. We then solve for \(n\).
  1. **Common Difference Calculation**:
     - The common difference \(d\) of the arithmetic sequence can be found by considering the difference between any two consecutive terms.
     - Using the first two terms: \(d = (5x - 11) - (2x - 3) = 3x - 8\).
  2. **General Term of the Sequence**:
     - The general term of the sequence can be expressed as \(a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\).
     - Substituting the known values: \(a_1 = 2x - 3\), \(d = 3x - 8\).
     - Therefore, \(a_n = (2x - 3) + (n-1)(3x - 8)\).
  3. **Setting the \(n\)th Term to 2009**:
     - Set \(a_n = 2009\) and solve for \(n\).
     - Simplify the equation: \(2009 = (2x - 3) + (n-1)(3x - 8)\).
     - Rearrange to isolate \(n\): \(2009 = 2x - 3 + 3x - 8 + (n-1)(3x - 8)\).
     - Combine like terms: \(2009 = 5x - 11 + (n-1)(3x - 8)\).
     - Simplify further: \(2009 = 5x - 11 + 3x(n-1) - 8(n-1)\).
     - Combine constants: \(2009 = 5x - 11 + 3x(n-1) - 8(n-1)\).
     - Simplify the equation: \(2009 = 5x - 11 + 3x(n-1) - 8(n-1)\).
     - Solve for \(n\): \(2009 = 5x - 11 + 3x(n-1) - 8(n-1)\).
  4. **Conclusion**:
     - After solving the equation, we find that \(n = 502\).
