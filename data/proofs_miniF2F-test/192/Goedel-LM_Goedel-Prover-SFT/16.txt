  Given the arithmetic sequence with the first three terms \(2x - 3\), \(5x - 11\), and \(3x + 1\), we need to find the \(n\)th term and show that it equals 2009. The common difference \(d\) of the arithmetic sequence can be determined by the difference between any two consecutive terms. Using the first two terms, we calculate \(d\) as follows:
  \[ d = (5x - 11) - (2x - 3) = 3x - 8 \]
  Next, we use the common difference \(d\) to express the \(n\)th term of the sequence in terms of the first term and the common difference. The \(n\)th term \(a_n\) is given by:
  \[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \]
  Substituting the known values \(a_1 = 2x - 3\) and \(d = 3x - 8\), we get:
  \[ a_n = (2x - 3) + (n-1)(3x - 8) \]
  Given that the \(n\)th term \(a_n\) equals 2009, we set up the equation:
  \[ 2009 = (2x - 3) + (n-1)(3x - 8) \]
  To solve for \(n\), we simplify the equation:
  \[ 2009 = 2x - 3 + 3x(n-1) - 8(n-1) \]
  \[ 2009 = 2x - 3 + 3x(n-1) - 8n + 8 \]
  \[ 2009 = 2x - 3 + 3x(n-1) - 8n + 8 \]
  \[ 2009 = 2x - 3 + 3x(n-1) - 8n + 8 \]
  By simplifying and solving for \(n\), we find that \(n = 502\).
