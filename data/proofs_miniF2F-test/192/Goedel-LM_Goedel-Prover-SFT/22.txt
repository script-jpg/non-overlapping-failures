  Given the arithmetic sequence with the first three terms \(2x - 3\), \(5x - 11\), and \(3x + 1\), we need to find the \(n\)th term and determine \(n\). The \(n\)th term of the sequence is given as \(2009\). By the properties of an arithmetic sequence, the common difference \(d\) can be calculated using the first three terms. The common difference \(d\) is found to be \(2\). Using the formula for the \(n\)th term of an arithmetic sequence, we can set up the equation \(2009 = 2x - 3 + (n - 1) \cdot 2\). Solving for \(n\), we find that \(n = 502\).
