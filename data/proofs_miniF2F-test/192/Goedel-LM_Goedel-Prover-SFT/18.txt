  Given the arithmetic sequence with the first three terms \(2x - 3\), \(5x - 11\), and \(3x + 1\), we need to determine the \(n\)th term and show that it equals 2009. The common difference \(d\) of the arithmetic sequence can be calculated as follows:
  \[
  d = (5x - 11) - (2x - 3) = 3x - 8
  \]
  \[
  d = (3x + 1) - (5x - 11) = -2x + 12
  \]
  Since the common difference must be consistent, we equate the two expressions for \(d\):
  \[
  3x - 8 = -2x + 12
  \]
  Solving for \(x\):
  \[
  5x = 20 \implies x = 4
  \]
  Now, we calculate the first term \(a_1\) using \(x = 4\):
  \[
  a_1 = 2(4) - 3 = 5
  \]
  The common difference \(d\) is:
  \[
  d = 3(4) - 8 = 4
  \]
  The \(n\)th term of the sequence is given by:
  \[
  a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d
  \]
  Given \(a_n = 2009\), we solve for \(n\):
  \[
  2009 = 5 + (n - 1) \cdot 4
  \]
  \[
  2009 = 5 + 4n - 4
  \]
  \[
  2009 = 4n + 1
  \]
  \[
  2008 = 4n
  \]
  \[
  n = 502
  \]
  Thus, the value of \(n\) is 502.
