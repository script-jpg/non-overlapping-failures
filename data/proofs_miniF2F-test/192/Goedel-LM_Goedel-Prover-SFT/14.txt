  Given the arithmetic sequence defined by the first three terms \(2x - 3\), \(5x - 11\), and \(3x + 1\), we need to find the value of \(n\) such that the \(n\)th term of the sequence is \(2009\).
  First, we calculate the common difference \(d\) of the arithmetic sequence. By subtracting the first term from the second term, we get:
  \[ d = (5x - 11) - (2x - 3) = 3x - 8 \]
  Next, we express the third term in terms of the first term and the common difference:
  \[ a_3 = a_1 + 2d \]
  Substituting the values of \(a_1\) and \(d\):
  \[ 3x + 1 = (2x - 3) + 2(3x - 8) \]
  Simplifying the right-hand side:
  \[ 3x + 1 = 2x - 3 + 6x - 16 \]
  \[ 3x + 1 = 8x - 19 \]
  Solving for \(x\):
  \[ 3x + 1 = 8x - 19 \]
  \[ 1 + 19 = 8x - 3x \]
  \[ 20 = 5x \]
  \[ x = 4 \]
  Now, we find the common difference:
  \[ d = 3x - 8 = 3(4) - 8 = 12 - 8 = 4 \]
  The \(n\)th term of an arithmetic sequence can be expressed as:
  \[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \]
  Substituting \(a_1\) and \(d\):
  \[ 2009 = (2x - 3) + (n-1) \cdot 4 \]
  Substituting \(x = 4\):
  \[ 2009 = (2(4) - 3) + (n-1) \cdot 4 \]
  \[ 2009 = 5 + (n-1) \cdot 4 \]
  Solving for \(n\):
  \[ 2009 = 5 + 4(n-1) \]
  \[ 2009 = 5 + 4n - 4 \]
  \[ 2009 = 4n + 1 \]
  \[ 2008 = 4n \]
  \[ n = 502 \]
  Thus, the value of \(n\) is \(502\).
