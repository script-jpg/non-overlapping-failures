  Given the complex plane, let \( A \) be the set of solutions to \( z^3 - 8 = 0 \) and let \( B \) be the set of solutions to \( z^3 - 8z^2 - 8z + 64 = 0 \). We need to determine the greatest distance between a point of \( A \) and a point of \( B \).
  First, we calculate the solutions to the equations:
  - For \( z^3 - 8 = 0 \), the solutions are \( z = 2 \) and \( z = -2 \).
  - For \( z^3 - 8z^2 - 8z + 64 = 0 \), the solutions are \( z = 4 \), \( z = 2 \), and \( z = -2 \).
  Next, we compute the distance between the solutions of these equations. The distance between two complex numbers \( z_1 \) and \( z_2 \) is given by \( |z_1 - z_2| \).
  - The distance between \( z = 2 \) and \( z = 4 \) is \( |2 - 4| = 2 \).
  - The distance between \( z = 2 \) and \( z = -2 \) is \( |2 - (-2)| = 4 \).
  - The distance between \( z = -2 \) and \( z = 4 \) is \( |-2 - 4| = 6 \).
  Thus, the greatest distance between a point of \( A \) and a point of \( B \) is \( 6 \).
