  To show that the greatest distance between a point of \( A \) and a point of \( B \) is \( 2\sqrt{21} \), we start by defining \( A \) as the set of solutions to \( z^3 - 8 = 0 \) and \( B \) as the set of solutions to \( z^3 - 8z^2 - 8z + 64 = 0 \). We need to find the distance between the points of \( A \) and \( B \) in the complex plane.
  
  First, we solve the equations:
  - \( z^3 - 8 = 0 \) implies \( z = 2 \)
  - \( z^3 - 8z^2 - 8z + 64 = 0 \) implies \( z = 2 \), \( z = 4 \), or \( z = -2 \).
  Thus, the points of \( A \) are \( 2 \) and the points of \( B \) are \( 2 \), \( 4 \), and \( -2 \). The distance between these points is calculated as follows:
  - The distance between \( 2 \) and \( 2 \) is \( 0 \).
  - The distance between \( 2 \) and \( 4 \) is \( 2 \).
  - The distance between \( 2 \) and \( -2 \) is \( 4 \).
  - The distance between \( 4 \) and \( 4 \) is \( 0 \).
  - The distance between \( 4 \) and \( -2 \) is \( 6 \).
  - The distance between \( -2 \) and \( -2 \) is \( 0 \).
  The maximum distance is \( 6 \), but the problem states that the greatest distance is \( 2\sqrt{21} \). This discrepancy suggests a need for a more detailed geometric analysis or a correction in the problem setup.
