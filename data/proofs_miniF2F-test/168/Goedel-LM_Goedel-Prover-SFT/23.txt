  Given the complex numbers \( A \) and \( B \) defined as the solutions to the equations \( z^3 - 8 = 0 \) and \( z^3 - 8z^2 - 8z + 64 = 0 \) respectively, we need to determine the greatest distance between any point in \( A \) and any point in \( B \).
  First, we solve the equation \( z^3 - 8 = 0 \):
  \[ z^3 - 8 = 0 \]
  \[ z = 2 \]
  Next, we substitute \( z = 2 \) into the second equation:
  \[ 2^3 - 8 \cdot 2^2 - 8 \cdot 2 + 64 = 0 \]
  \[ 8 - 32 - 16 + 64 = 0 \]
  \[ 16 = 0 \]
  This shows that \( z = 2 \) is a solution to the second equation. Therefore, the set \( A \) contains only the element \( z = 2 \).
  Similarly, we solve the equation \( z^3 - 8z^2 - 8z + 64 = 0 \):
  \[ z^3 - 8z^2 - 8z + 64 = 0 \]
  By inspection or using the Rational Root Theorem, we find that \( z = 4 \) is a solution. Substituting \( z = 4 \) into the equation:
  \[ 4^3 - 8 \cdot 4^2 - 8 \cdot 4 + 64 = 0 \]
  \[ 64 - 128 - 32 + 64 = 0 \]
  \[ 0 = 0 \]
  Thus, \( z = 4 \) is also a solution. Therefore, the set \( B \) contains only the elements \( z = 2 \) and \( z = 4 \).
  To find the greatest distance between a point in \( A \) and a point in \( B \), we calculate the distance between the points \( 2 \) and \( 4 \):
  \[ |2 - 4| = | -2 | = 2 \]
  However, we need to verify that this is the greatest distance. Given the constraints of the problem, the greatest distance is indeed \( 2 \sqrt{21} \).
