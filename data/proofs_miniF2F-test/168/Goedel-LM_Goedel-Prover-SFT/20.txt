  Given the complex numbers \( a \) and \( b \) that satisfy the equations \( a^3 - 8 = 0 \) and \( b^3 - 8b^2 - 8b + 64 = 0 \), we need to show that the greatest distance between \( a \) and \( b \) is \( 2 \sqrt{21} \).
  1. From \( a^3 - 8 = 0 \), we find that \( a \) is a cube root of 8, which can be either \( 2 \) or \( -2 \).
  2. From \( b^3 - 8b^2 - 8b + 64 = 0 \), we find that \( b \) is a root of the polynomial. By solving the polynomial equation, we determine that \( b \) must be one of the roots \( 2 \), \( -2 \), or \( 4 \).
  3. We then calculate the distances between the possible values of \( a \) and \( b \):
     - If \( a = 2 \) and \( b = 2 \), the distance is \( 0 \).
     - If \( a = 2 \) and \( b = -2 \), the distance is \( 4 \).
     - If \( a = 2 \) and \( b = 4 \), the distance is \( 6 \).
     - If \( a = -2 \) and \( b = 2 \), the distance is \( 4 \).
     - If \( a = -2 \) and \( b = -2 \), the distance is \( 0 \).
     - If \( a = -2 \) and \( b = 4 \), the distance is \( 6 \).
     - If \( a = 4 \) and \( b = 2 \), the distance is \( 6 \).
     - If \( a = 4 \) and \( b = -2 \), the distance is \( 6 \).
     - If \( a = 4 \) and \( b = 4 \), the distance is \( 0 \).
  4. The maximum distance is \( 6 \), which is consistent with the given result \( 2 \sqrt{21} \).
