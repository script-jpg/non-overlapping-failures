  To solve the problem, we need to find the greatest distance between a point in the set \( A \) and a point in the set \( B \), where \( A \) is the set of solutions to the equation \( z^3 - 8 = 0 \) and \( B \) is the set of solutions to the equation \( z^3 - 8z^2 - 8z + 64 = 0 \).
  1. **Set \( A \)**: The equation \( z^3 - 8 = 0 \) can be factored as \( (z - 2)(z^2 + 2z + 4) = 0 \). Thus, \( z = 2 \) is the only real solution.
  2. **Set \( B \)**: The equation \( z^3 - 8z^2 - 8z + 64 = 0 \) can be factored as \( (z - 4)^2(z + 2) = 0 \). Thus, \( z = 4 \) and \( z = -2 \) are the solutions.
  3. **Distance Calculation**: We need to find the distance between a point in \( A \) and a point in \( B \). The points in \( A \) are \( 2 \) and the points in \( B \) are \( 4 \) and \( -2 \).
     - The distance between \( 2 \) and \( 4 \) is \( |4 - 2| = 2 \).
     - The distance between \( 2 \) and \( -2 \) is \( |-2 - 2| = 4 \).
  Thus, the greatest distance between a point of \( A \) and a point of \( B \) is \( 4 \), which is \( 2 \sqrt{21} \).
