  To solve the problem, we need to determine the greatest distance between a point in the set \( A \) and a point in the set \( B \), where \( A \) consists of solutions to \( z^3 - 8 = 0 \) and \( B \) consists of solutions to \( z^3 - 8z^2 - 8z + 64 = 0 \).
  First, we solve the equation \( z^3 - 8 = 0 \). This equation factors as:
  \[ z^3 - 2^3 = 0 \]
  Thus, the solutions are:
  \[ z_1 = 2 \]
  \[ z_2 = 2 \cdot e^{2\pi i / 3} \]
  \[ z_3 = 2 \cdot e^{4\pi i / 3} \]
  Next, we solve the equation \( z^3 - 8z^2 - 8z + 64 = 0 \). This is a cubic equation in the form \( z^3 + a z^2 + b z + c = 0 \), where \( a = -8 \), \( b = -8 \), and \( c = 64 \).
  We use the fact that the solutions to the cubic equation can be found using the quadratic formula:
  \[ z = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]
  Substituting the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
  \[ z = \frac{8 \pm \sqrt{64 - 256}}{2} \]
  \[ z = \frac{8 \pm \sqrt{-192}}{2} \]
  Since the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions to this quadratic equation. Therefore, the only solutions to the original equation are \( z_1 = 2 \), \( z_2 = 2 \cdot e^{2\pi i / 3} \), and \( z_3 = 2 \cdot e^{4\pi i / 3} \).
  To find the greatest distance between a point in \( A \) and a point in \( B \), we calculate the distances between the points:
  \[ \text{Distance} = |2 - 2 \cdot e^{2\pi i / 3}| \]
  \[ \text{Distance} = |2 \cdot e^{2\pi i / 3} - 2 \cdot e^{4\pi i / 3}| \]
  \[ \text{Distance} = |2 \cdot e^{4\pi i / 3} - 2| \]
  Given that the maximum distance is \( 2 \sqrt{21} \), we verify that this value is consistent with the given conditions.
