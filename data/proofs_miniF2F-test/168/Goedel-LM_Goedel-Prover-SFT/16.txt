  Given the sets \( A = \{z \in \mathbb{C} \mid z^3 - 8 = 0\} \) and \( B = \{z \in \mathbb{C} \mid z^3 - 8z^2 - 8z + 64 = 0\} \), we need to determine the greatest distance between a point of \( A \) and a point of \( B \).
  First, solve the equations:
  1. \( z^3 - 8 = 0 \) implies \( z = 2 \).
  2. \( z^3 - 8z^2 - 8z + 64 = 0 \) implies \( z = 4 \) or \( z = 2 \).
  Next, compute the distances between the points of \( A \) and \( B \):
  - The point in \( A \) is \( 2 \).
  - The points in \( B \) are \( 4 \) and \( 2 \).
  Calculate the distances:
  - Distance between \( 2 \) and \( 4 \) is \( \sqrt{(4 - 2)^2} = \sqrt{4} = 2 \).
  - Distance between \( 2 \) and \( 2 \) is \( \sqrt{(2 - 2)^2} = \sqrt{0} = 0 \).
  Thus, the greatest distance between a point of \( A \) and a point of \( B \) is \( 2 \).
