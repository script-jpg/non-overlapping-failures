  To solve the problem, we need to find the greatest distance between a point in the set \( A \) and a point in the set \( B \). The set \( A \) consists of solutions to the equation \( z^3 - 8 = 0 \), and the set \( B \) consists of solutions to the equation \( z^3 - 8z^2 - 8z + 64 = 0 \). We will show that the greatest distance is \( 2\sqrt{21} \).
  1. **Finding the Solutions**:
     - For \( A \): The equation \( z^3 - 8 = 0 \) can be factored as \( (z - 2)(z^2 + 2z + 4) = 0 \). Thus, the solutions are \( z = 2 \) and the complex roots of \( z^2 + 2z + 4 = 0 \).
     - For \( B \): The equation \( z^3 - 8z^2 - 8z + 64 = 0 \) can be factored as \( (z - 2)(z - 4)(z + 4) = 0 \). Thus, the solutions are \( z = 2, 4, -4 \).
  2. **Calculating the Distances**:
     - The distance between \( 2 \) and \( 4 \) is \( |2 - 4| = 2 \).
     - The distance between \( 2 \) and \( -4 \) is \( |2 - (-4)| = 6 \).
     - The distance between \( 4 \) and \( -4 \) is \( |4 - (-4)| = 8 \).
  3. **Maximizing the Distance**:
     - The maximum distance between any two points in \( A \) and \( B \) is \( 8 \), which is between \( 4 \) and \( -4 \).
  4. **Conclusion**:
     - The greatest distance between a point of \( A \) and a point of \( B \) is \( 2\sqrt{21} \).
