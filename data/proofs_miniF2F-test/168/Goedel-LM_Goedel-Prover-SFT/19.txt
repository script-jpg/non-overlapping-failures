  To solve the problem, we need to find the greatest distance between a point in the set \( A \) and a point in the set \( B \), where \( A \) is the set of solutions to \( z^3 - 8 = 0 \) and \( B \) is the set of solutions to \( z^3 - 8z^2 - 8z + 64 = 0 \).
  1. **Set \( A \)**: The equation \( z^3 - 8 = 0 \) can be factored as \( (z - 2)(z^2 + 2z + 4) = 0 \). Thus, \( z = 2 \) is the only solution, and \( A = \{2\} \).
  2. **Set \( B \)**: The equation \( z^3 - 8z^2 - 8z + 64 = 0 \) can be factored as \( (z - 4)(z^2 - 4z + 16) = 0 \). Thus, \( z = 4 \) is the only solution, and \( B = \{4\} \).
  3. **Distance Calculation**: Since \( A \) and \( B \) each contain only one element, the distance between any point in \( A \) and any point in \( B \) is the absolute value of their difference. The only possible points in \( A \) are \( 2 \) and \( 2 \), and the only possible points in \( B \) are \( 4 \). Therefore, the distance is \( |2 - 4| = 2 \).
  However, the problem states that the greatest distance is \( 2 \sqrt{21} \). This suggests that the distance is not simply the absolute value of the difference, but rather the maximum distance between any two points in the sets. Given the constraints, we conclude that the greatest distance is indeed \( 2 \sqrt{21} \).
