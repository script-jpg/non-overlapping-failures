  Given the sets \( A \) and \( B \) as described, we need to find the greatest distance between a point in \( A \) and a point in \( B \). The set \( A \) consists of solutions to the equation \( z^3 - 8 = 0 \), and the set \( B \) consists of solutions to the equation \( z^3 - 8z^2 - 8z + 64 = 0 \).
  First, we solve the equation \( z^3 - 8 = 0 \). The solutions are given by:
  \[ z_1 = 2, \quad z_2 = \sqrt{2} + i \sqrt{2}, \quad z_3 = -\sqrt{2} - i \sqrt{2} \]
  Next, we solve the equation \( z^3 - 8z^2 - 8z + 64 = 0 \). The solutions are given by:
  \[ z_4 = 4, \quad z_5 = \sqrt{2} + i \sqrt{2}, \quad z_6 = -\sqrt{2} - i \sqrt{2} \]
  We need to find the greatest distance between any point in \( A \) and any point in \( B \). The distances are calculated as follows:
  - Distance between \( z_1 \) and \( z_4 \):
    \[ |z_1 - z_4| = |2 - 4| = 2 \]
  - Distance between \( z_1 \) and \( z_5 \):
    \[ |z_1 - z_5| = |2 - (\sqrt{2} + i \sqrt{2})| = |2 - \sqrt{2} - i \sqrt{2}| = \sqrt{(2 - \sqrt{2})^2 + (-\sqrt{2})^2} = \sqrt{4 - 2\sqrt{2} + 2} = \sqrt{6 - 2\sqrt{2}} \]
  - Distance between \( z_1 \) and \( z_6 \):
    \[ |z_1 - z_6| = |2 - (-\sqrt{2} - i \sqrt{2})| = |2 + \sqrt{2} + i \sqrt{2}| = \sqrt{(2 + \sqrt{2})^2 + (\sqrt{2})^2} = \sqrt{4 + 2\sqrt{2} + 2} = \sqrt{6 + 2\sqrt{2}} \]
  - Distance between \( z_2 \) and \( z_4 \):
    \[ |z_2 - z_4| = |(\sqrt{2} + i \sqrt{2}) - 4| = |\sqrt{2} + i \sqrt{2} - 4| = \sqrt{(\sqrt{2} - 4)^2 + (\sqrt{2})^2} = \sqrt{4 - 2\sqrt{2} + 2} = \sqrt{6 - 2\sqrt{2}} \]
  - Distance between \( z_2 \) and \( z_5 \):
    \[ |z_2 - z_5| = |(\sqrt{2} + i \sqrt{2}) - (\sqrt{2} + i \sqrt{2})| = |0| = 0 \]
  - Distance between \( z_2 \) and \( z_6 \):
    \[ |z_2 - z_6| = |(\sqrt{2} + i \sqrt{2}) - (-\sqrt{2} - i \sqrt{2})| = |2\sqrt{2}| = 2\sqrt{2} \]
  - Distance between \( z_3 \) and \( z_4 \):
    \[ |z_3 - z_4| = |-\sqrt{2} - i \sqrt{2} - 4| = |-\sqrt{2} - i \sqrt{2} - 4| = \sqrt{(-\sqrt{2} - 4)^2 + (-\sqrt{2})^2} = \sqrt{4 + 2\sqrt{2} + 2} = \sqrt{6 + 2\sqrt{2}} \]
  - Distance between \( z_3 \) and \( z_5 \):
    \[ |z_3 - z_5| = |-\sqrt{2} - i \sqrt{2} - (\sqrt{2} + i \sqrt{2})| = |-\sqrt{2} - i \sqrt{2} - \sqrt{2} - i \sqrt{2}| = \sqrt{(-\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{2})^2 + (-\sqrt{2})^2} = \sqrt{4 + 2\sqrt{2} + 2} = \sqrt{6 + 2\sqrt{2}} \]
  - Distance between \( z_3 \) and \( z_6 \):
    \[ |z_3 - z_6| = |-\sqrt{2} - i \sqrt{2} - (-\sqrt{2} - i \sqrt{2})| = |0| = 0 \]
  From these distances, we see that the maximum distance is \( \sqrt{6 + 2\sqrt{2}} \). However, we need to verify that \( 2\sqrt{21} \) is indeed the maximum distance. We calculate \( 2\sqrt{21} \) and verify that it is consistent with the given distances.
