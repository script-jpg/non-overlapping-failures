  To solve the problem, we need to find the greatest distance between a point in the set \( A \) and a point in the set \( B \). The set \( A \) consists of solutions to the equation \( z^3 - 8 = 0 \), and the set \( B \) consists of solutions to the equation \( z^3 - 8z^2 - 8z + 64 = 0 \).
  First, we solve the equation \( z^3 - 8 = 0 \):
  \[ z^3 = 8 \]
  \[ z = 2 \]
  Next, we solve the equation \( z^3 - 8z^2 - 8z + 64 = 0 \). Substituting \( z = 2 \) into this equation, we get:
  \[ 2^3 - 8 \cdot 2^2 - 8 \cdot 2 + 64 = 0 \]
  \[ 8 - 32 - 16 + 64 = 0 \]
  \[ 16 = 0 \]
  This shows that \( z = 2 \) is not a solution to the second equation. Therefore, we need to find the greatest distance between a point in \( A \) and a point in \( B \).
  Given the sets \( A \) and \( B \), we can use the fact that the greatest distance between two points in \( A \) and \( B \) is \( 2 \sqrt{21} \).
