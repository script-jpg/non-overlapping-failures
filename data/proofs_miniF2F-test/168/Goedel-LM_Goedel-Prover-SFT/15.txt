  Given the complex numbers \( A \) and \( B \) defined as the solutions to the equations \( z^3 - 8 = 0 \) and \( z^3 - 8z^2 - 8z + 64 = 0 \), respectively, we need to determine the greatest distance between any point in \( A \) and any point in \( B \).
  First, we note that the solutions to \( z^3 - 8 = 0 \) are \( 2 \) and \( 2 \pm 2\sqrt{3}i \). The solutions to \( z^3 - 8z^2 - 8z + 64 = 0 \) are \( 2 \), \( 4 \), and \( 4 \pm 2\sqrt{21}i \).
  To find the greatest distance between any two points, we consider the possible pairs:
  1. \( 2 \) and \( 2 \pm 2\sqrt{3}i \)
  2. \( 2 \) and \( 4 \)
  3. \( 2 \) and \( 4 \pm 2\sqrt{21}i \)
  4. \( 2 \pm 2\sqrt{3}i \) and \( 4 \)
  5. \( 2 \pm 2\sqrt{3}i \) and \( 4 \pm 2\sqrt{21}i \)
  6. \( 2 \) and \( 2 \pm 2\sqrt{3}i \) and \( 4 \)
  7. \( 2 \) and \( 2 \pm 2\sqrt{3}i \) and \( 4 \pm 2\sqrt{21}i \)
  8. \( 2 \pm 2\sqrt{3}i \) and \( 4 \) and \( 4 \pm 2\sqrt{21}i \)
  By calculating the distances for each pair, we find that the maximum distance is \( 2\sqrt{21} \).
