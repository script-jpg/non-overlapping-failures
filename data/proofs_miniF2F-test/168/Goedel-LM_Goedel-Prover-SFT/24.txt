  To show that the greatest distance between a point of \( A \) and a point of \( B \) is \( 2\sqrt{21} \), we start by considering the sets \( A \) and \( B \) defined by the equations \( z^3 - 8 = 0 \) and \( z^3 - 8z^2 - 8z + 64 = 0 \), respectively. We need to find the complex numbers \( a \) and \( b \) that satisfy these equations.
  1. **Solving for \( a \)**: From \( a^3 - 8 = 0 \), we get \( a^3 = 8 \). The solutions are \( a = 2 \) and \( a = -2 \).
  2. **Solving for \( b \)**: From \( b^3 - 8b^2 - 8b + 64 = 0 \), we can factorize it as \( (b - 4)^3 = 0 \). Thus, \( b = 4 \).
  Next, we calculate the distance between \( a \) and \( b \):
  \[
  |a - b| = |2 - 4| = | -2 | = 2
  \]
  However, we need to verify the maximum distance given in the problem, which is \( 2\sqrt{21} \). We can use the fact that the distance between two points in the complex plane is given by the absolute value of their difference.
