  To solve the problem, we need to find the greatest distance between a point of \( A \) and a point of \( B \), where \( A \) is the set of solutions to \( z^3 - 8 = 0 \) and \( B \) is the set of solutions to \( z^3 - 8z^2 - 8z + 64 = 0 \).
  1. **Solve for the elements of \( A \)**:
     - The equation \( z^3 - 8 = 0 \) can be factored as \( (z - 2)(z^2 + 2z + 4) = 0 \).
     - Thus, \( z = 2 \) or \( z^2 + 2z + 4 = 0 \).
     - The complex solutions to \( z^2 + 2z + 4 = 0 \) are found using the quadratic formula \( z = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 - 16}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{-12}}{2} = -1 \pm i\sqrt{3} \).
     - Therefore, \( A = \{2, -1 + i\sqrt{3}, -1 - i\sqrt{3}\} \).
  2. **Solve for the elements of \( B \)**:
     - The equation \( z^3 - 8z^2 - 8z + 64 = 0 \) can be factored as \( (z - 2)(z^2 - 6z + 16) = 0 \).
     - Thus, \( z = 2 \) or \( z^2 - 6z + 16 = 0 \).
     - The complex solutions to \( z^2 - 6z + 16 = 0 \) are found using the quadratic formula \( z = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 64}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{-28}}{2} = 3 \pm i\sqrt{7} \).
     - Therefore, \( B = \{2, 3 + i\sqrt{7}, 3 - i\sqrt{7}\} \).
  3. **Calculate the greatest distance \( |a - b| \)**:
     - The possible pairs \( (a, b) \) are \( (2, -1 + i\sqrt{3}) \), \( (2, -1 - i\sqrt{3}) \), \( (2, 3 + i\sqrt{7}) \), \( (2, 3 - i\sqrt{7}) \), \( (-1 + i\sqrt{3}, 3 + i\sqrt{7}) \), \( (-1 - i\sqrt{3}, 3 - i\sqrt{7}) \), \( (-1 + i\sqrt{3}, 3 - i\sqrt{7}) \), \( (-1 - i\sqrt{3}, 3 + i\sqrt{7}) \).
     - The distance \( |a - b| \) for each pair is calculated using the distance formula in the complex plane.
     - The maximum distance is found to be \( 2\sqrt{21} \).
