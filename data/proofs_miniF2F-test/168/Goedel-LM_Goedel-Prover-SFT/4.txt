  Given the complex numbers \( a \) and \( b \) such that \( a^3 - 8 = 0 \) and \( b^3 - 8b^2 - 8b + 64 = 0 \), we need to determine the greatest distance between \( a \) and \( b \) in the complex plane.
  1. From \( a^3 - 8 = 0 \), we find \( a = 2 \).
  2. Substituting \( a = 2 \) into the second equation, we get \( b^3 - 8b^2 - 8b + 64 = 0 \).
  3. Solving for \( b \), we find \( b = 4 \) or \( b = 2 \pm 2\sqrt{3} \).
  4. The distance between \( a = 2 \) and \( b = 4 \) is \( |2 - 4| = 2 \).
  5. The distance between \( a = 2 \) and \( b = 2 \pm 2\sqrt{3} \) is \( |2 - (2 \pm 2\sqrt{3})| = 2\sqrt{3} \).
  6. Therefore, the greatest distance between \( a \) and \( b \) is \( 2\sqrt{3} \).
