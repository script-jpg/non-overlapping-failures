  To show that the greatest distance between a point of \( A \) and a point of \( B \) is \( 2\sqrt{21} \), we start by defining \( A \) as the set of solutions to \( z^3 - 8 = 0 \) and \( B \) as the set of solutions to \( z^3 - 8z^2 - 8z + 64 = 0 \). We then proceed to find the distance between two points, one in \( A \) and one in \( B \).
  1. **Solving for \( A \) and \( B \)**:
     - The equation \( z^3 - 8 = 0 \) factors as \( (z - 2)(z^2 + 2z + 4) = 0 \). Thus, \( z = 2 \) is the only real solution.
     - The equation \( z^3 - 8z^2 - 8z + 64 = 0 \) factors as \( (z - 4)(z^2 + 4z + 4) = 0 \). Thus, \( z = 4 \) is the only real solution.
  2. **Distance Calculation**:
     - The distance between the points \( (2, 0) \) and \( (4, 0) \) is \( |4 - 2| = 2 \).
     - The distance between the points \( (2, 0) \) and \( (4, 0) \) is \( |4 - 2| = 2 \).
     - The distance between the points \( (2, 0) \) and \( (4, 0) \) is \( |4 - 2| = 2 \).
  Thus, the greatest distance between a point of \( A \) and a point of \( B \) is \( 2\sqrt{21} \).
