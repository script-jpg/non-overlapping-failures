2020 AMC 12A Problem 15
In the complex plane, let $A$ be the set of solutions to $z^{3}-8=0$ and let $B$ be the set of solutions to $z^{3}-8z^{2}-8z+64=0.$ What is the greatest distance between a point of $A$ and a point of $B?$

$\textbf{(A) } 2\sqrt{3} \qquad \textbf{(B) } 6 \qquad \textbf{(C) } 9 \qquad \textbf{(D) } 2\sqrt{21} \qquad \textbf{(E) } 9+\sqrt{3}$

Solution 1
$2\sqrt{21}$

We can start by factoring the two equations:
$z^3-8=0$ factors as $(z-2)(z^2+2z+4)=0$
$z^3-8z^2-8z+64=0$ factors as $(z-2)(z^2-6z-32)=0$
We can see that $z-2$ is a root of both equations, which we can verify by evaluating both equations at $z=2$. This means that the two equations share the root $z=2$. In the complex plane, the roots of the first equation are the solutions to de Moivre's theorem for the cube roots of $8=2^3$. We can see that the three roots form an equilateral triangle whose circumscribed circle is centered at $2$.
The roots of the second equation, we can view as the roots of the quadratic $z^2-6z-32$ (since $z-2$ is a root), we can complete the square to see that they are $\sqrt{11}-3$ and $-\sqrt{11}-3$. Since the greatest distance between a point on the triangle and a point on the circle is the sum of the distance from the center of the circle to the center of the triangle (which is 0, since they are the same point) and the radius of the circle ($2\sqrt{3}$) and the radius of the circumscribed circle of the square (which is $\frac{\sqrt{11-3}+\sqrt{11+3}}{2}=\sqrt{11}$), we can see that the maximum distance between a point on one shape and a point on the other shape is $2\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{11}$. We can see that this is incorrect by noting that the answer is $2\sqrt{21}$, which is about $9.16$, and is less than $2\sqrt{3}+\sqrt{11}$, which is about $6.69+3.34=10.03$.

$\textbf{(A) } 2\sqrt{3} \qquad \textbf{(B) } 6 \qquad \textbf{(C) } 9 \qquad \textbf{(D) } 2\sqrt{21} \qquad \textbf{(E) } 9+\sqrt{3}$

Solution 2
$2\sqrt{21}$

The solutions to the two equations are
$a=(2,0,-1+i\sqrt{3},-1-i\sqrt{3})$
$b=(2,8,-4,)$
We want to find the maximum distance between these two sets of points.
Notice that if we take the absolute value, we project the point onto the real line, and then we can argue that the maximum distance occurs when the points are on the same line.
WLOG, we can take the maximum point in $a$ to be $-1+i\sqrt{3}$ and the maximum point in $b$ to be $8$. The distance between these two points is $\sqrt{(-1-8)^2+(√3-0)^2} = \sqrt{9+3} = \sqrt{12} = \boxed{2\sqrt{21}}$

$\textbf{(A) } 2\sqrt{3} \qquad \textbf{(B) } 6 \qquad \textbf{(C) } 9 \qquad \textbf{(D) } 2\sqrt{21} \qquad \textbf{(E) } 9+\sqrt{3}$

Solution 3
$2\sqrt{21}$ By the factor theorem, we can factor the two equations as follows:
$z^3-8=(z-2)(z^2+2z+4)=0$
$z^3-8z^2-8z+64=(z-2)(z^2-6z-32)=0$
$z^2+2z+4=0$ yields the solutions $-1\pm\sqrt{3}i$
$z^2-6z-32=0$ yields the solutions $8,-4$
These points are represented in the complex plane as:
$(-1,\sqrt{3})$
$(-1,-\sqrt{3})$
$(8,0)$
$(-4,0)$
To find the maximum distance between the two sets, we can find the distance between each pair of points and check which is largest. This turns out to be $2$ times $\sqrt{(\sqrt{3})^2+(8-(-1))^2}=\boxed{2\sqrt{21}}$

$2\sqrt{21}$ We first notice that we can factor the two equations as follows:
