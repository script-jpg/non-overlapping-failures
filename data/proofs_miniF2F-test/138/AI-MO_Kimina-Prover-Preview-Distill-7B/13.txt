-- The gcd of $n$ and $40$ is $10$. So $10$ is the largest number that divides both $n$ and $40$.
  -- The lcm of $n$ and $40$ is $280$. So $280$ is the smallest number that is divisible by both $n$ and $40$.
  -- We can use the relationship between gcd and lcm: $\gcd(n, 40) \times \mathop{\text{lcm}}[n, 40] = n \times 40$.
  have key := Nat.gcd_mul_lcm n 40

  -- Using the relationship between gcd and lcm, we can find $n$.
