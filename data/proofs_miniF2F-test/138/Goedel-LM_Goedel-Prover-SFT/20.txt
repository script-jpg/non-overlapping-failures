  Given \( n \) such that \( \gcd(n, 40) = 10 \) and \( \mathop{\text{lcm}}[n, 40] = 280 \), we need to show that \( n = 70 \). We start by using the property that the product of \( n \) and 40 is equal to the product of their gcd and lcm. Using the given values, we substitute these into the equation and simplify to find \( n \).

  -- We use the property that the product of n and 40 is equal to the product of their gcd and lcm.
  have h₃ : n * 40 = Nat.gcd n 40 * Nat.lcm n 40 := by rw [Nat.gcd_mul_lcm]
  -- Substitute the given values of gcd and lcm into the equation.
  rw [h₁, h₂] at h₃
  -- Simplify the equation to solve for n.
  have h₄ : n * 40 = 10 * 280 := h₃
  -- Simplify the right-hand side of the equation.
  have h₅ : n * 40 = 2800 := by linarith
  -- Solve for n by dividing both sides by 40.
  have h₆ : n = 2800 / 40 := by omega
  -- Simplify the division to find the value of n.
  have h₇ : n = 70 := by simp [h₆]
  -- Conclude the proof.
  exact h₇
