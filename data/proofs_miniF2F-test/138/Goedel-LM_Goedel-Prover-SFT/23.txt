  Given \( \gcd(n, 40) = 10 \) and \( \mathop{\text{lcm}}[n, 40] = 280 \), we need to find \( n \). We start by using the relationship between the greatest common divisor (gcd) and the least common multiple (lcm):
  \[
  \gcd(n, 40) \cdot \mathop{\text{lcm}}[n, 40] = n \cdot 40
  \]
  Substituting the given values:
  \[
  10 \cdot 280 = n \cdot 40
  \]
  Solving for \( n \):
  \[
  2800 = n \cdot 40 \implies n = \frac{2800}{40} = 70
  \]
  Thus, \( n = 70 \).

  -- Use the relationship between gcd and lcm: gcd(n, 40) * lcm(n, 40) = n * 40
  have h₃ := Nat.gcd_mul_lcm n 40
  -- Substitute the given values of gcd and lcm into the equation
  rw [h₁, h₂] at h₃
  -- Simplify the equation to solve for n
  norm_num at h₃
  -- Use the omega tactic to solve the resulting linear equation
