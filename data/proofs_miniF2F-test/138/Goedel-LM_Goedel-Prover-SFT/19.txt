  Given \( n \) such that \( \gcd(n, 40) = 10 \) and \( \mathop{\text{lcm}}[n, 40] = 280 \), we need to show that \( n = 70 \).
  1. We start by using the property that the product of \( n \) and 40 is equal to the product of their greatest common divisor and least common multiple.
  2. We use the given values of the greatest common divisor and least common multiple to set up an equation.
  3. We simplify the equation to solve for \( n \).
  4. Finally, we verify that \( n = 70 \) satisfies the original conditions.
