  Given \( n \) such that \(\gcd(n, 40) = 10\) and \(\mathop{\text{lcm}}[n, 40] = 280\), we need to show that \( n = 70 \).
  1. Start by using the relationship between the greatest common divisor (gcd) and the least common multiple (lcm) of two numbers, which states that the product of the gcd and lcm of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves.
  2. Substitute the given values of gcd and lcm into this relationship to form an equation involving \( n \) and 40.
  3. Simplify the equation using the properties of gcd and lcm to solve for \( n \).
  4. Verify that the solution \( n = 70 \) satisfies the given conditions.
