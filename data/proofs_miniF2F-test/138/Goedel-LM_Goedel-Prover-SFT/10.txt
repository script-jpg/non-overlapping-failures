  Given \( n \) is a natural number such that \(\gcd(n, 40) = 10\) and \(\mathop{\text{lcm}}[n, 40] = 280\), we need to show that \( n = 70 \).
  First, we use the property that the product of the greatest common divisor and the least common multiple of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. Therefore, we have:
  \[
  \gcd(n, 40) \times \mathop{\text{lcm}}[n, 40] = n \times 40
  \]
  Substituting the given values:
  \[
  10 \times 280 = n \times 40
  \]
  Simplifying the left-hand side:
  \[
  2800 = n \times 40
  \]
  Solving for \( n \):
  \[
  n = \frac{2800}{40} = 70
  \]
  Thus, \( n = 70 \).
