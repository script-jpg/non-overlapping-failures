  Given \( n \) such that \( \gcd(n, 40) = 10 \) and \( \mathop{\text{lcm}}[n, 40] = 280 \), we need to show that \( n = 70 \).
  1. Start by using the property that the product of the greatest common divisor and the least common multiple of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves.
  2. Substitute the given values of \( \gcd(n, 40) \) and \( \mathop{\text{lcm}}[n, 40] \) into the equation.
  3. Simplify the resulting equation to solve for \( n \).
  4. Verify that the solution \( n = 70 \) satisfies the original conditions.
