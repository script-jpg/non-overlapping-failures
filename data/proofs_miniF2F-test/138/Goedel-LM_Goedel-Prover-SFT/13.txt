  Given \( n \) such that \( \gcd(n, 40) = 10 \) and \( \text{lcm}[n, 40] = 280 \), we need to show that \( n = 70 \).
  1. From the property of the greatest common divisor and the least common multiple, we have:
     \[
     \gcd(n, 40) \cdot \text{lcm}[n, 40] = n \cdot 40
     \]
  2. Substituting the given values \( \gcd(n, 40) = 10 \) and \( \text{lcm}[n, 40] = 280 \) into the equation, we get:
     \[
     10 \cdot 280 = n \cdot 40
     \]
  3. Solving for \( n \):
     \[
     n = \frac{10 \cdot 280}{40} = 70
     \]
