  Given \( n \) such that \( \gcd(n, 40) = 10 \) and \( \mathop{\text{lcm}}[n, 40] = 280 \), we need to show that \( n = 70 \).
  1. Start by using the relationship between the greatest common divisor (gcd) and the least common multiple (lcm).
  2. Use the property that the product of \( n \) and 40 is equal to the product of their gcd and lcm.
  3. Substitute the known values of gcd and lcm into the equation.
  4. Simplify the equation to solve for \( n \).
  5. Verify that \( n = 70 \) satisfies the original conditions.
