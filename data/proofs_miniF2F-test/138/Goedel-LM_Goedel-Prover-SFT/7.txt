  Given \( \gcd(n, 40) = 10 \) and \( \mathop{\text{lcm}}[n, 40] = 280 \), we need to find \( n \). We know that for any two natural numbers \( a \) and \( b \), \( \gcd(a, b) \times \mathop{\text{lcm}}[a, b] = a \times b \). Using this property, we can verify that \( n \times 40 = 10 \times 280 \). Solving for \( n \), we find \( n = 70 \).

  -- Use the property that the product of the gcd and lcm of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves.
  have h₃ : n * 40 = 10 * 280 := by
    rw [← Nat.gcd_mul_lcm n 40]
    simp [h₁, h₂]
  -- Solve for n by dividing both sides of the equation by 40.
  have h₄ : n = 70 := by
    apply Eq.symm
    apply Nat.eq_of_mul_eq_mul_right (show 0 < 40 by linarith)
    linarith
  -- The final result is n = 70.
  exact h₄
