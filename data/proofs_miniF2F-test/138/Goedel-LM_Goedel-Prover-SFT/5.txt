  Given \( \gcd(n, 40) = 10 \) and \( \mathop{\text{lcm}}[n, 40] = 280 \), we need to find \( n \) and show that it equals 70.
  1. We start by using the property that the product of \( n \) and 40 is equal to the product of their gcd and lcm.
  2. Substituting the given values of gcd and lcm into this property, we get an equation involving \( n \).
  3. Simplifying this equation using numerical computations, we find that \( n = 70 \).
