  Given \( n \) such that \( \gcd(n, 40) = 10 \) and \( \mathop{\text{lcm}}[n, 40] = 280 \), we need to show that \( n = 70 \).
  First, we use the property that the product of the greatest common divisor (gcd) and the least common multiple (lcm) of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. Therefore, we have:
  \[ 10 \times 280 = n \times 40 \]
  Solving for \( n \):
  \[ 2800 = 40n \]
  \[ n = \frac{2800}{40} \]
  \[ n = 70 \]
  Thus, the value of \( n \) is indeed 70.
