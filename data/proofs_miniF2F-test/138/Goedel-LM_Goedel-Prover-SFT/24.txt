  Given \( \gcd(n, 40) = 10 \) and \( \mathop{\text{lcm}}[n, 40] = 280 \), we need to find \( n \). We start by using the property that the product of the greatest common divisor and the least common multiple of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. Using this property, we can set up an equation involving \( n \), 40, and their gcd and lcm. By substituting the given values into this equation and simplifying, we can solve for \( n \).
