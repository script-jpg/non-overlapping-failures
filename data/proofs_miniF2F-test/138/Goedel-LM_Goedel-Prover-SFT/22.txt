  Given \( n \) is a natural number such that \( \gcd(n, 40) = 10 \) and \( \mathop{\text{lcm}}[n, 40] = 280 \), we need to show that \( n = 70 \).
  1. We start by using the property that the product of \( n \) and 40 is equal to the product of their gcd and lcm:
     \[
     n \cdot 40 = \gcd(n, 40) \cdot \mathop{\text{lcm}}[n, 40]
     \]
  2. Substitute the given values for gcd and lcm into the equation:
     \[
     n \cdot 40 = 10 \cdot 280
     \]
  3. Simplify the right-hand side:
     \[
     n \cdot 40 = 2800
     \]
  4. Solve for \( n \) by dividing both sides by 40:
     \[
     n = \frac{2800}{40} = 70
     \]
  Thus, \( n = 70 \).
