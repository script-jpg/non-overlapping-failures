  Given \( n \) such that \(\gcd(n, 40) = 10\) and \(\mathop{\text{lcm}}[n, 40] = 280\), we need to show that \( n = 70 \).
  1. Start by using the property that the product of \(\gcd(n, 40)\) and \(\mathop{\text{lcm}}[n, 40]\) is equal to \( n \times 40 \).
  2. Substitute the given values of \(\gcd(n, 40)\) and \(\mathop{\text{lcm}}[n, 40]\) into the equation.
  3. Simplify the equation to solve for \( n \).
  4. Use the fact that \(\gcd(n, 40) = 10\) and \(\mathop{\text{lcm}}[n, 40] = 280\) to verify that \( n = 70 \).
