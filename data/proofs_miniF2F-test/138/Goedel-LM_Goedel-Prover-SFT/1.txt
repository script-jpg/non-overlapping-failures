  Given \( n \) such that \( \gcd(n, 40) = 10 \) and \( \text{lcm}[n, 40] = 280 \), we need to show that \( n = 70 \).
  1. Start with the property between the greatest common divisor (gcd) and the least common multiple (lcm):
     \[
     \gcd(n, 40) \cdot \text{lcm}[n, 40] = n \cdot 40
     \]
  2. Substitute the given values into the equation:
     \[
     10 \cdot 280 = n \cdot 40
     \]
  3. Simplify the left-hand side:
     \[
     2800 = n \cdot 40
     \]
  4. Solve for \( n \) by dividing both sides by 40:
     \[
     n = \frac{2800}{40} = 70
     \]
  Thus, \( n = 70 \).

  have h₃ := Nat.gcd_mul_lcm n 40
  -- Use the property that gcd(n, 40) * lcm[n, 40] = n * 40
  rw [h₁, h₂] at h₃
  -- Substitute the given values of gcd and lcm into the equation
  norm_num at h₃
  -- Simplify the equation to 2800 = n * 40
  apply Nat.eq_of_mul_eq_mul_right (show 0 < 40 by norm_num)
  -- Solve for n by dividing both sides by 40
