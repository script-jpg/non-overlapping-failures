  Given \( n \) such that \( \gcd(n, 40) = 10 \) and \( \mathop{\text{lcm}}[n, 40] = 280 \), we need to show that \( n = 70 \).
  1. From the property of the greatest common divisor (gcd) and the least common multiple (lcm), we know that \( \gcd(n, 40) \cdot \mathop{\text{lcm}}[n, 40] = n \cdot 40 \).
  2. Substituting the given values into this equation, we get \( 10 \cdot 280 = n \cdot 40 \).
  3. Simplifying the left-hand side, we find \( 2800 = n \cdot 40 \).
  4. Dividing both sides by 40, we obtain \( n = \frac{2800}{40} \).
  5. Simplifying the right-hand side, we find \( n = 70 \).

  -- Simplify the equation to solve for n.
  -- The equation now is 10 * 280 = n * 40, which simplifies to 2800 = n * 40.
  -- Dividing both sides by 40, we get n = 2800 / 40, which simplifies to n = 70.
