  Given \( n \) such that \( \gcd(n, 40) = 10 \) and \( \text{lcm}[n, 40] = 280 \), we need to show that \( n = 70 \).
  1. Start by using the property that the product of the gcd and lcm of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves.
  2. Substitute the known values of the gcd and lcm into the equation.
  3. Simplify the resulting equation to solve for \( n \).

  -- Use the property that the product of the gcd and lcm of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves.
  have h₃ := Nat.gcd_mul_lcm n 40
  -- Substitute the known values of the gcd and lcm into the equation.
  simp only [h₁, h₂] at h₃
  -- Simplify the resulting equation to solve for n.
  have : n * 40 = 10 * 280 := by linarith
  have : n * 40 = 2800 := by linarith
  have : n = 70 := by linarith
