  Given \( n \) such that \( \gcd(n, 40) = 10 \) and \( \mathop{\text{lcm}}[n, 40] = 280 \), we need to show that \( n = 70 \).
  First, we use the property that the product of the greatest common divisor and the least common multiple of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves:
  \[ \gcd(n, 40) \cdot \mathop{\text{lcm}}[n, 40] = n \cdot 40 \]
  Substituting the given values:
  \[ 10 \cdot 280 = n \cdot 40 \]
  Simplifying this equation:
  \[ 2800 = n \cdot 40 \]
  Dividing both sides by 40:
  \[ n = \frac{2800}{40} \]
  \[ n = 70 \]
  Thus, we have shown that \( n = 70 \).
