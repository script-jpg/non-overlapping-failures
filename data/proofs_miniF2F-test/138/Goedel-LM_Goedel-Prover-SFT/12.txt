  Given \( n \) such that \(\gcd(n, 40) = 10\) and \(\mathop{\text{lcm}}[n, 40] = 280\), we need to show that \( n = 70 \).
  1. Start with the property that the product of the greatest common divisor (gcd) and the least common multiple (lcm) of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves.
  2. Substitute the given values of gcd and lcm into the equation.
  3. Simplify the equation to solve for \( n \).
  4. Verify the solution using numerical calculations.
