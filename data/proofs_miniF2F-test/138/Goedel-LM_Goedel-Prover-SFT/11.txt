  To solve for \( n \) given that \(\gcd(n, 40) = 10\) and \(\mathop{\text{lcm}}[n, 40] = 280\), we need to use the relationship between the greatest common divisor (gcd) and the least common multiple (lcm). The product of \( n \) and 40 is equal to the product of their gcd and lcm. Using this relationship, we can set up an equation and solve for \( n \).
  -/
  have h₃ : n * 40 = 10 * 280 := by
    -- Use the property that the product of n and 40 equals the product of their gcd and lcm.
    rw [← Nat.gcd_mul_lcm n 40]
    simp [h₁, h₂]
  -- Simplify the equation to solve for n.
