  Given \( n \) such that \( \gcd(n, 40) = 10 \) and \( \mathop{\text{lcm}}[n, 40] = 280 \), we need to show that \( n = 70 \).
  1. From the given conditions, we know:
     \[
     \gcd(n, 40) = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad \mathop{\text{lcm}}[n, 40] = 280
     \]
  2. Using the property that the product of the gcd and lcm of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves, we get:
     \[
     n \cdot 40 = 10 \cdot 280
     \]
  3. Simplifying the right-hand side:
     \[
     10 \cdot 280 = 2800
     \]
  4. Therefore:
     \[
     n \cdot 40 = 2800
     \]
  5. Solving for \( n \):
     \[
     n = \frac{2800}{40} = 70
     \]
  Thus, \( n \) must be 70.
