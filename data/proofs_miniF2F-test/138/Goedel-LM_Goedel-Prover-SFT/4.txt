  Given \( n \) such that \( \gcd(n, 40) = 10 \) and \( \text{lcm}(n, 40) = 280 \), we need to show that \( n = 70 \).
  First, we use the property that the product of the greatest common divisor and the least common multiple of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. Therefore, we have:
  \[ \gcd(n, 40) \times \text{lcm}(n, 40) = n \times 40 \]
  Substituting the given values:
  \[ 10 \times 280 = n \times 40 \]
  Simplifying the left-hand side:
  \[ 2800 = n \times 40 \]
  To find \( n \), we divide both sides by 40:
  \[ n = \frac{2800}{40} \]
  \[ n = 70 \]
  Thus, we have shown that \( n = 70 \).

  -- Use the property that gcd(n, 40) * lcm(n, 40) = n * 40
  have gcd_mul_lcm : n * 40 = Nat.gcd n 40 * Nat.lcm n 40 := by rw [Nat.gcd_mul_lcm]
  -- Substitute the given values of gcd and lcm into the equation
  rw [h₁, h₂] at gcd_mul_lcm
  -- Simplify the equation to solve for n
