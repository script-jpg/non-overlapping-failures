  To solve the problem of finding the remainder when the 100th term of the Fibonacci sequence is divided by 4, we start by understanding the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4. The Fibonacci sequence modulo 4 has a periodic pattern. We need to determine the period and then use it to find the 100th term modulo 4.
  1. **Understanding the Fibonacci Sequence Modulo 4**:
     - The Fibonacci sequence is defined by \( a_1 = 1 \), \( a_2 = 1 \), and \( a_{n+2} = a_{n+1} + a_n \).
     - We need to find the period of the sequence modulo 4.
  2. **Periodicity of the Fibonacci Sequence Modulo 4**:
     - By computing the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4, we observe that it is periodic with a period of 6.
     - The sequence modulo 4 is \( 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3 \).
  3. **Finding the 100th Term Modulo 4**:
     - Since the sequence is periodic with period 6, we can reduce 100 modulo 6.
     - \( 100 \mod 6 = 4 \).
     - Therefore, the 100th term is the same as the 4th term in the sequence.
     - From the sequence, the 4th term is 3.
  4. **Conclusion**:
     - The remainder when the 100th term of the Fibonacci sequence is divided by 4 is 3.
