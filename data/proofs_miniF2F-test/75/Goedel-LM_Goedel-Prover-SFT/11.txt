  To determine the remainder when the 100th term of the Fibonacci sequence is divided by 4, we need to analyze the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4. The Fibonacci sequence is defined by \( F_1 = 1 \), \( F_2 = 1 \), and \( F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_n \).
  First, we observe the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4:
  - \( F_1 = 1 \equiv 1 \mod 4 \)
  - \( F_2 = 1 \equiv 1 \mod 4 \)
  - \( F_3 = F_1 + F_2 = 1 + 1 = 2 \equiv 2 \mod 4 \)
  - \( F_4 = F_2 + F_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 \equiv 3 \mod 4 \)
  - \( F_5 = F_3 + F_4 = 2 + 3 = 5 \equiv 1 \mod 4 \)
  - \( F_6 = F_4 + F_5 = 3 + 1 = 4 \equiv 0 \mod 4 \)
  - \( F_7 = F_5 + F_6 = 1 + 0 = 1 \equiv 1 \mod 4 \)
  - \( F_8 = F_6 + F_7 = 0 + 1 = 1 \equiv 1 \mod 4 \)
  From this pattern, we see that \( F_n \mod 4 \) alternates between 1, 1, 2, 3, and then repeats. Specifically, \( F_n \mod 4 \) cycles every 4 terms.
  Since 100 modulo 4 is 0, the 100th term of the Fibonacci sequence is congruent to the 4th term in the cycle modulo 4. From the pattern, the 4th term is 3.
  Thus, the remainder when the 100th term of the Fibonacci sequence is divided by 4 is 3.

  -- We need to show that the 100th term of the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4 is 3.
  -- First, observe the pattern of the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4.
  -- The sequence starts with 1, 1, 2, 3, and then repeats every 4 terms.
  -- Since 100 modulo 4 is 0, the 100th term is congruent to the 4th term in the cycle.
  -- From the pattern, the 4th term is 3.
  -- Therefore, the remainder when the 100th term is divided by 4 is 3.
