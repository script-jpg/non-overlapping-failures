  To determine the remainder when the 100th term of the Fibonacci sequence is divided by 4, we start by analyzing the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4. The Fibonacci sequence is defined by \( a_1 = 1 \), \( a_2 = 1 \), and \( a_{n+2} = a_{n+1} + a_n \) for \( n \geq 1 \).
  First, we compute the initial terms of the sequence modulo 4:
  - \( a_1 = 1 \)
  - \( a_2 = 1 \)
  - \( a_3 = a_2 + a_1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \)
  - \( a_4 = a_3 + a_2 = 2 + 1 = 3 \)
  - \( a_5 = a_4 + a_3 = 3 + 2 = 5 \equiv 1 \mod 4 \)
  - \( a_6 = a_5 + a_4 = 1 + 3 = 4 \equiv 0 \mod 4 \)
  - \( a_7 = a_6 + a_5 = 0 + 1 = 1 \)
  - \( a_8 = a_7 + a_6 = 1 + 0 = 1 \)
  We observe that the sequence modulo 4 repeats every 6 terms: \( 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0 \). To find \( a_{100} \mod 4 \), we note that \( 100 \mod 6 = 4 \), so \( a_{100} \equiv a_4 \mod 4 \). From our earlier calculations, \( a_4 \equiv 3 \mod 4 \).
  Thus, the remainder when the 100th term of the Fibonacci sequence is divided by 4 is 3.
