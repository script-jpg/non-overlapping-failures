  To determine the remainder when the 100th term of the Fibonacci sequence is divided by 4, we need to find the pattern in the sequence modulo 4. The Fibonacci sequence is defined by \( a_n \) where \( a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} \) for \( n \geq 3 \).
  First, we compute the first few terms of the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4:
  - \( a_0 = 1 \)
  - \( a_1 = 1 \)
  - \( a_2 = 1 \)
  - \( a_3 = 1 + 1 = 2 \)
  - \( a_4 = 1 + 2 = 3 \)
  - \( a_5 = 2 + 3 = 5 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \)
  - \( a_6 = 3 + 1 = 4 \equiv 0 \pmod{4} \)
  - \( a_7 = 1 + 0 = 1 \pmod{4} \)
  - \( a_8 = 1 + 1 = 2 \pmod{4} \)
  - \( a_9 = 3 + 1 = 4 \equiv 0 \pmod{4} \)
  We observe that the sequence modulo 4 repeats every 6 terms. Specifically, the sequence is \( 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 0 \).
  Given that the sequence repeats every 6 terms, we can determine the position of \( a_{100} \) in the cycle. Since \( 100 \mod 6 = 2 \), \( a_{100} \) corresponds to \( a_2 \) in the cycle.
  From our initial pattern, \( a_2 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \). Therefore, the remainder when \( a_{100} \) is divided by 4 is 1.

  -- We need to show that the 100th term of the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4 is 3.
  -- First, we find the pattern in the sequence modulo 4.
  -- The sequence modulo 4 repeats every 6 terms: 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 0.
  -- Since 100 % 6 = 2, the 100th term corresponds to the 2nd term in the cycle.
  -- From the initial pattern, a_2 % 4 = 1.
  -- Therefore, the remainder when a_100 is divided by 4 is 1.
