  To determine the remainder when the 100th term of the Fibonacci sequence is divided by 4, we start by examining the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4. The Fibonacci sequence is defined by \( F_1 = 1 \), \( F_2 = 1 \), and \( F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_n \). We need to find the pattern in the sequence modulo 4.
  First, we compute the first few terms of the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4:
  - \( F_1 = 1 \)
  - \( F_2 = 1 \)
  - \( F_3 = 2 \)
  - \( F_4 = 3 \)
  - \( F_5 = 1 \)
  - \( F_6 = 2 \)
  - \( F_7 = 3 \)
  - \( F_8 = 1 \)
  - \( F_9 = 2 \)
  - \( F_{10} = 3 \)
  We observe that the sequence repeats every 6 terms modulo 4. Therefore, we can reduce the problem of finding the 100th term modulo 4 to finding the term at position 4 in the sequence.
  Thus, the 100th term of the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4 is equivalent to the 4th term in the sequence, which is 3.
