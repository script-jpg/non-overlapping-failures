  To determine the remainder when the 100th term of the Fibonacci sequence is divided by 4, we start by examining the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4. The Fibonacci sequence is defined by \( F_0 = 0 \), \( F_1 = 1 \), and \( F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_n \). We need to find \( F_{100} \mod 4 \).
  First, observe the pattern in the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4:
  - \( F_1 \equiv 1 \mod 4 \)
  - \( F_2 \equiv 1 \mod 4 \)
  - \( F_3 \equiv 2 \mod 4 \)
  - \( F_4 \equiv 3 \mod 4 \)
  - \( F_5 \equiv 1 \mod 4 \)
  - \( F_6 \equiv 1 \mod 4 \)
  - \( F_7 \equiv 2 \mod 4 \)
  - \( F_8 \equiv 3 \mod 4 \)
  - \( F_9 \equiv 1 \mod 4 \)
  - \( F_{10} \equiv 1 \mod 4 \)
  - \( F_{11} \equiv 2 \mod 4 \)
  - \( F_{12} \equiv 3 \mod 4 \)
  - \( F_{13} \equiv 1 \mod 4 \)
  - \( F_{14} \equiv 1 \mod 4 \)
  - \( F_{15} \equiv 2 \mod 4 \)
  - \( F_{16} \equiv 3 \mod 4 \)
  From this pattern, we see that \( F_n \mod 4 \) alternates between 1 and 3 depending on whether \( n \) is odd or even. Since 100 is even, we have:
  \[ F_{100} \equiv 3 \mod 4 \]
  Thus, the remainder when the 100th term of the Fibonacci sequence is divided by 4 is 3.

  -- To do this, we will compute the sequence modulo 4 up to the 100th term and observe the pattern.
