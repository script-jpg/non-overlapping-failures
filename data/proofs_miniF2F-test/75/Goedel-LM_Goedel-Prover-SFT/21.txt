  To determine the remainder when the 100th term of the Fibonacci sequence is divided by 4, we need to understand the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4. The Fibonacci sequence modulo 4 has a periodic pattern. We will show that the sequence modulo 4 repeats every 6 terms and that the 100th term modulo 4 is equivalent to the 4th term modulo 4.
  1. **Initial Conditions**:
     - \( a_1 = 1 \)
     - \( a_2 = 1 \)
  2. **Recurrence Relation**:
     - \( a_{n+2} = a_{n+1} + a_n \)
  3. **Modulo 4 Analysis**:
     - We need to compute the sequence modulo 4 and observe the periodicity.
  4. **Periodicity**:
     - By induction, we can show that \( a_n \equiv a_{n \mod 6} \mod 4 \).
     - Specifically, \( a_{100} \equiv a_4 \mod 4 \).
  5. **Compute \( a_4 \mod 4 \)**:
     - Using the recurrence relation, we can compute the sequence modulo 4 up to \( a_4 \).
     - \( a_3 = a_2 + a_1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \)
     - \( a_4 = a_3 + a_2 = 2 + 1 = 3 \)
  6. **Conclusion**:
     - Therefore, \( a_{100} \equiv 3 \mod 4 \).
