  To determine the remainder when the 100th term of the Fibonacci sequence is divided by 4, we start by understanding the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4. The Fibonacci sequence modulo 4 has a periodic pattern. We need to find the period and then use it to determine the 100th term modulo 4.
  1. **Understanding the Fibonacci Sequence Modulo 4**:
     - The Fibonacci sequence is defined by \( a_1 = 1 \), \( a_2 = 1 \), and \( a_{n+2} = a_{n+1} + a_n \).
     - We need to find the period of the sequence modulo 4.
  2. **Periodicity of the Fibonacci Sequence Modulo 4**:
     - By computing the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4, we observe a periodic pattern.
     - The sequence repeats every 6 terms modulo 4.
  3. **Finding the 100th Term Modulo 4**:
     - Since the sequence repeats every 6 terms, we can find the 100th term modulo 4 by finding the equivalent term within one period.
     - \( 100 \mod 6 = 4 \), so the 100th term is the same as the 4th term modulo 4.
  4. **Calculating the 4th Term Modulo 4**:
     - Using the Fibonacci sequence definition, we compute the 4th term modulo 4.
     - \( a_4 = a_3 + a_2 \), \( a_3 = a_2 + a_1 \), \( a_2 = 1 \), \( a_1 = 1 \).
     - Therefore, \( a_4 = (1 + 1) + 1 = 3 \).
  5. **Conclusion**:
     - The 100th term modulo 4 is 3.
