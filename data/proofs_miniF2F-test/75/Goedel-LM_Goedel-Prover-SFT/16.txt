  To solve the problem of finding the remainder when the 100th term of the Fibonacci sequence is divided by 4, we need to understand the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4. The Fibonacci sequence modulo 4 has a periodic pattern, and we can determine the period by examining the sequence.
  Given the Fibonacci sequence defined by \( a_1 = 1 \), \( a_2 = 1 \), and \( a_{n+2} = a_{n+1} + a_n \), we can observe that the sequence modulo 4 is periodic with a period of 6. This means that the sequence repeats every 6 terms modulo 4.
  To find the 100th term modulo 4, we can use the periodicity of the sequence. Since the sequence repeats every 6 terms, we can reduce the problem to finding the 100th term within one period.
