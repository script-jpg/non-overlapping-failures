  To determine the remainder when the 100th term of the Fibonacci sequence is divided by 4, we need to compute the 100th term modulo 4. The Fibonacci sequence is defined by \( a_1 = 1 \), \( a_2 = 1 \), and \( a_{n+2} = a_{n+1} + a_n \) for \( n \geq 1 \). We will use the periodicity of the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4 to simplify the computation.
  
  First, we observe the periodicity of the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4. We calculate the first few terms modulo 4:
  - \( a_1 = 1 \)
  - \( a_2 = 1 \)
  - \( a_3 = a_2 + a_1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \)
  - \( a_4 = a_3 + a_2 = 2 + 1 = 3 \)
  - \( a_5 = a_4 + a_3 = 3 + 2 = 5 \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \)
  - \( a_6 = a_5 + a_4 = 1 + 3 = 4 \equiv 0 \pmod{4} \)
  - \( a_7 = a_6 + a_5 = 0 + 1 = 1 \pmod{4} \)
  - \( a_8 = a_7 + a_6 = 1 + 0 = 1 \pmod{4} \)
  From this, we see that the sequence repeats every 6 terms modulo 4. Therefore, we can reduce the problem to finding \( a_{100} \mod 4 \).
  
  Since \( 100 \mod 6 = 4 \), we have:
  \[ a_{100} \equiv a_4 \pmod{4} \]
  From the calculation above, \( a_4 \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \).
  Thus, the remainder when the 100th term of the Fibonacci sequence is divided by 4 is 3.
