  The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation \( a_{n+2} = a_{n+1} + a_n \) with initial conditions \( a_1 = 1 \) and \( a_2 = 1 \). We need to determine the remainder when the 100th term of the sequence is divided by 4.
  First, we observe that the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4 exhibits a periodic pattern. By calculating the first few terms modulo 4, we can identify the period and use it to find the 100th term modulo 4.
