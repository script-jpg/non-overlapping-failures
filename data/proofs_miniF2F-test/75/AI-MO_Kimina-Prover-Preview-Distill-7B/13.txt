-- We will show that the 100th Fibonacci number is congruent to 3 modulo 4.
  -- To solve this, we can use the property of Fibonacci numbers and modulo operations.
  -- Let's compute the first few Fibonacci numbers modulo 4 to identify a pattern:
  -- a₁ ≡ 1 (mod 4)
  -- a₂ ≡ 1 (mod 4)
  -- a₃ ≡ 2 (mod 4)
  -- a₄ ≡ 3 (mod 4)
  -- a₅ ≡ 1 (mod 4)  -- since 5 ≡ 1 (mod 4)
  -- a₆ ≡ 0 (mod 4)
  -- a₇ ≡ 1 (mod 4)  -- since 3 ≡ 1 (mod 4)
  -- a₈ ≡ 1 (mod 4)  -- since 5 ≡ 1 (mod 4)
  -- a₉ ≡ 2 (mod 4)
  -- a₁₀ ≡ 3 (mod 4)
  --...
  -- We observe that starting from a₅, the sequence modulo 4 appears to repeat every 12 terms:
  -- a₅ ≡ a₁ (mod 4)
  -- a₆ ≡ a₂ (mod 4)
  -- a₇ ≡ a₃ (mod 4)
  --...
  -- This periodicity with period 12 is known for Fibonacci numbers modulo m, where m > 0.
  -- It is called the Pisano period π(m).
  -- For m = 4, π(4) = 6, not 12. Let's recalculate:
  -- a₁ ≡ 1 (mod 4)
  -- a₂ ≡ 1 (mod 4)
  -- a₃ ≡ 2 (mod 4)
  -- a₄ ≡ 3 (mod 4)
  -- a₅ ≡ 1 (mod 4)
  -- a₆ ≡ 0 (mod 4)
  -- a₇ ≡ 1 (mod 4)
  -- a₈ ≡ 1 (mod 4)
  -- a₉ ≡ 2 (mod 4)
  -- a₁₀ ≡ 3 (mod 4)
  -- a₁₁ ≡ 1 (mod 4)
  -- a₁₂ ≡ 0 (mod 4)
  -- a₁₃ ≡ 1 (mod 4)
  --...
  -- Now we see that starting from a₅, the sequence modulo 4 repeats every 6 terms:
  -- a₅ ≡ a₁ (mod 4)
  -- a₆ ≡ a₂ (mod 4)
  -- a₇ ≡ a₃ (mod 4)
  --...
  -- So π(4) = 6.
  -- To find a₁₀₀ % 4, we compute 100 - 4 = 96, and 96 is divisible by 6.
  -- Therefore, a₁₀₀ ≡ a₄ (mod 4).
  -- Since a₄ ≡ 3 (mod 4), we have a₁₀₀ ≡ 3 (mod 4).
  -- Let's complete this in Lean:

  -- Now, to compute a₁₀₀ % 4, we can compute the sequence modulo 4:
