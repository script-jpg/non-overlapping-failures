-- We want to find the remainder when the 100th Fibonacci number is divided by 4.
  -- Let's first understand the problem: We have a sequence defined as:
  -- a₁ = 1, a₂ = 1, and aₙ₊₂ = aₙ₊₁ + aₙ for n ≥ 1.
  -- We need to find a₁₀₀ mod 4.

  -- Notice that to find a number in the Fibonacci sequence mod 4, we can look at the pattern of Fibonacci numbers mod 4.
  -- Let's compute the first few terms mod 4 to identify any periodicity:
  -- a₁ = 1 mod 4
  -- a₂ = 1 mod 4
  -- a₃ = 2 mod 4
  -- a₄ = 3 mod 4
  -- a₅ = 5 mod 4 = 1
  -- a₆ = 8 mod 4 = 0
  -- a₇ = 13 mod 4 = 1
  -- a₈ = 21 mod 4 = 1
  -- a₉ = 34 mod 4 = 2
  -- a₁₀ = 55 mod 4 = 3
  -- a₁₁ = 89 mod 4 = 1
  -- a₁₂ = 144 mod 4 = 0
  --...
  -- It appears that the sequence repeats every 6 terms starting from a₁.
  -- Let's verify this periodicity.

  -- We'll prove by induction that aₙ = aₙ₆ for all n ≥ 1, which would show the sequence is periodic with period 6.
  -- But actually, we only need to compute a₁₀₀ mod 4, so we can look for a pattern directly.

  -- Since the sequence is defined recursively, we'll need to compute earlier terms to find a₁₀₀.
  -- But with the periodicity in mind, we can compute a₁₀₀ as a₄ since 100 ≡ 4 mod 6.
  -- From our calculations above, a₄ mod 4 = 3.

  -- Let's write the Lean proof to formalize this reasoning:

  -- First, we need to show that the sequence is periodic mod 4 with period 6.
  -- To do this, we'll prove by induction that aₙ = aₙ₆ for all n ≥ 1.

  -- Base case: n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 all have the same value mod 6.
  -- Inductive step: Assume aₙ = aₙ₆ and aₙ₊₁ = aₙ₇ for some n ≥ 1.
  -- Then aₙ₊₂ = aₙ₊₁ + aₙ = aₙ₇ + aₙ₆ = aₙ₈ by the inductive hypothesis and the recursive definition.

  -- Once we have established periodicity, we can compute a₁₀₀ = a₄, and a₄ mod 4 = 3.

  -- In Lean, we could formalize this as follows:

  have h₃ : a 100 % 4 = 3 := by
    -- To compute a₁₀₀ mod 4, we can use the periodicity we discovered.
    -- Since the sequence is periodic with period 6, a₁₀₀ = a₄
    -- a₄ = 3 mod 4
    norm_num [h₀, h₁, h₂] <;> omega
  exact h₃
