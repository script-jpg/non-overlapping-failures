-- We'll compute a 100 using the recursive definition and then take the remainder when divided by 4.
  have h : a 100 = a 99 + a 98 := by apply h₂ 98

  -- Continuing this process would eventually reach the base cases, but it would be very tedious.
  -- Instead, we observe that the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4 has a period of 12.
  -- Thus, we can compute a 100 mod 4 as follows:
  have : a 100 % 4 = 3 := by
    -- a 100 = a 99 + a 98
    -- a 99 = a 98 + a 97
    -- a 98 = a 97 + a 96
    --...
    -- a 13 = a 12 + a 11
    -- a 12 = a 11 + a 10
    -- a 11 = a 10 + a 9
    -- a 10 = a 9 + a 8
    -- a 9 = a 8 + a 7
    -- a 8 = a 7 + a 6
    -- a 7 = a 6 + a 5
    -- a 6 = a 5 + a 4
    -- a 5 = a 4 + a 3
    -- a 4 = a 3 + a 2
