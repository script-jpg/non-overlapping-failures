-- We first observe that the Fibonacci sequence has a property that every 60 terms, the sequence repeats modulo 4.
  have h : a 100 % 4 = a 4 % 4 := by congr 100 (by decide) <;> rfl
  have h' : a 4 % 4 = 2 := by simp [h₀, h₁, h₂]
  -- Since 100 = 60 + 40, and the sequence repeats every 60 terms modulo 4,
  -- we have that the 100th term is equal to the 40th term, and so the remainder when divided by 4 is 2.
