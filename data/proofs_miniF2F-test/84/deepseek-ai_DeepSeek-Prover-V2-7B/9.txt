  To find the radius of the circle with the given equation \(x^2 + 8x + y^2 - 6y = 0\), we need to complete the square for both \(x\) and \(y\).
  
  1. **Completing the square for \(x\)**:
     - Start with \(x^2 + 8x\).
     - Divide the coefficient of \(x\) by 2 and square it: \(\left(\frac{8}{2}\right)^2 = 16\).
     - Add and subtract 16 inside the equation: \(x^2 + 8x + 16 - 16\).
     - This can be factored as: \((x + 4)^2 - 16\).
  
  2. **Completing the square for \(y\)**:
     - Start with \(y^2 - 6y\).
     - Divide the coefficient of \(y\) by 2 and square it: \(\left(\frac{-6}{2}\right)^2 = 9\).
     - Add and subtract 9 inside the equation: \(y^2 - 6y + 9 - 9\).
     - This can be factored as: \((y - 3)^2 - 9\).
  
  3. **Substitute these back into the original equation**:
     \[
     x^2 + 8x + y^2 - 6y = 0
     \]
     becomes:
     \[
     (x + 4)^2 - 16 + (y - 3)^2 - 9 = 0
     \]
     Combine the constants:
     \[
     (x + 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 - 25 = 0
     \]
     Add 25 to both sides to isolate the squared terms:
     \[
     (x + 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 25
     \]
     Recognize that 25 is \(5^2\), so the radius is 5.
  
  Thus, the radius of the circle is \(5\).
