  To find the radius of the circle with the equation \( x^2 + 8x + y^2 - 6y = 0 \), we start by completing the square for both \( x \) and \( y \).
  1. Rewrite the equation \( x^2 + 8x + y^2 - 6y = 0 \) by completing the square:
     - For \( x \): \( x^2 + 8x \) can be rewritten as \( (x + 4)^2 - 16 \).
     - For \( y \): \( y^2 - 6y \) can be rewritten as \( (y - 3)^2 - 9 \).
  2. Substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
     \[
     (x + 4)^2 - 16 + (y - 3)^2 - 9 = 0
     \]
  3. Simplify the equation:
     \[
     (x + 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 - 25 = 0
     \]
  4. Add 25 to both sides to isolate the squared terms:
     \[
     (x + 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 25
     \]
  Thus, the radius of the circle is \( \sqrt{25} = 5 \).
