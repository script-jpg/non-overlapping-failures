  To find the radius of the circle with the equation \( x^2 + 8x + y^2 - 6y = 0 \), we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle, \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\), where \((h, k)\) is the center and \(r\) is the radius.
  1. Start with the given equation:
     \[
     x^2 + 8x + y^2 - 6y = 0
     \]
  2. Complete the square for the \(x\) and \(y\) terms:
     \[
     x^2 + 8x = (x + 4)^2 - 16
     \]
     \[
     y^2 - 6y = (y - 3)^2 - 9
     \]
  3. Substitute these completed squares back into the equation:
     \[
     (x + 4)^2 - 16 + (y - 3)^2 - 9 = 0
     \]
  4. Simplify the equation:
     \[
     (x + 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 - 25 = 0
     \]
     \[
     (x + 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 25
     \]
  5. This shows that the equation is in the form \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\) where \((h, k) = (-4, 3)\) and \(r = 5\).
  Thus, the radius of the circle is \(5\).
