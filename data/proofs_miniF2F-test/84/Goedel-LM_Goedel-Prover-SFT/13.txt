  To find the radius of the circle with the equation \( x^2 + 8x + y^2 - 6y = 0 \), we need to show that the equation can be rewritten in the form \( (x + 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 5^2 \). We start by completing the square for both \( x \) and \( y \) terms.
  1. For \( x \):
     \[
     x^2 + 8x = (x + 4)^2 - 16
     \]
  2. For \( y \):
     \[
     y^2 - 6y = (y - 3)^2 - 9
     \]
  Substituting these into the original equation, we get:
  \[
  (x + 4)^2 - 16 + (y - 3)^2 - 9 = 0
  \]
  Simplifying this, we obtain:
  \[
  (x + 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 - 25 = 0
  \]
  Thus, we have:
  \[
  (x + 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 25
  \]
  This shows that the radius of the circle is 5.
