  To find the radius of the circle with the equation \( x^2 + 8x + y^2 - 6y = 0 \), we need to complete the square for both \( x \) and \( y \).
  1. Start with the given equation:
     \[
     x^2 + 8x + y^2 - 6y = 0
     \]
  2. Complete the square for \( x \):
     \[
     x^2 + 8x = (x + 4)^2 - 16
     \]
  3. Complete the square for \( y \):
     \[
     y^2 - 6y = (y - 3)^2 - 9
     \]
  4. Substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
     \[
     (x + 4)^2 - 16 + (y - 3)^2 - 9 = 0
     \]
  5. Simplify the equation:
     \[
     (x + 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 - 25 = 0
     \]
  6. Rearrange to find the circle equation in standard form:
     \[
     (x + 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 25
     \]
  7. The radius of the circle is the square root of 25, which is 5.
