  To find the radius of the circle with the equation \( x^2 + 8x + y^2 - 6y = 0 \), we start by rewriting the equation in a more manageable form. We complete the square for both \( x \) and \( y \).
  First, we rewrite the equation:
  \[ x^2 + 8x + y^2 - 6y = 0 \]
  Next, we complete the square for \( x \):
  \[ x^2 + 8x = (x + 4)^2 - 16 \]
  Then, we complete the square for \( y \):
  \[ y^2 - 6y = (y - 3)^2 - 9 \]
  Substituting these completed squares back into the original equation, we get:
  \[ (x + 4)^2 - 16 + (y - 3)^2 - 9 = 0 \]
  Simplifying this, we have:
  \[ (x + 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 - 25 = 0 \]
  Thus, we obtain:
  \[ (x + 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 25 \]
  This shows that the radius of the circle is \( 5 \).
