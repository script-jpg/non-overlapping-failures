  To find the radius of the circle with the equation \( x^2 + 8x + y^2 - 6y = 0 \), we need to complete the square for both \( x \) and \( y \).
  1. For \( x \):
     \[
     x^2 + 8x = (x + 4)^2 - 16
     \]
  2. For \( y \):
     \[
     y^2 - 6y = (y - 3)^2 - 9
     \]
  Substituting these into the original equation, we get:
  \[
  (x + 4)^2 - 16 + (y - 3)^2 - 9 = 0
  \]
  Simplifying this, we have:
  \[
  (x + 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 - 25 = 0
  \]
  Thus:
  \[
  (x + 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 25
  \]
  This shows that the circle has a radius of 5.
