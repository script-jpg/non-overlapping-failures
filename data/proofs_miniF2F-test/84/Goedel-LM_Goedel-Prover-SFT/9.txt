  To find the radius of the circle given by the equation \( x^2 + 8x + y^2 - 6y = 0 \), we need to complete the square for both \( x \) and \( y \).
  1. Start with the equation \( x^2 + 8x + y^2 - 6y = 0 \).
  2. Complete the square for \( x \):
     \[
     x^2 + 8x = (x + 4)^2 - 16
     \]
  3. Complete the square for \( y \):
     \[
     y^2 - 6y = (y - 3)^2 - 9
     \]
  4. Substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
     \[
     (x + 4)^2 - 16 + (y - 3)^2 - 9 = 0
     \]
  5. Simplify the equation:
     \[
     (x + 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 - 25 = 0
     \]
  6. Isolate the squared terms:
     \[
     (x + 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 25
     \]
  7. Since \( 25 = 5^2 \), the radius of the circle is \( 5 \).
