-- We will find the radius of the circle given by the equation $x^2 + 8x + y^2 - 6y = 0$.

  -- The general form of a circle is: $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$ where $(h,k)$ is the center and $r$ is the radius.

  -- To convert the given equation to the general form, we complete the square for both $x$ and $y$ terms:

  have : x ^ 2 + 8 * x = (x + 4) ^ 2 - 4 ^ 2 := by ring
  have : y ^ 2 - 6 * y = (y - 3) ^ 2 - 3 ^ 2 := by ring

  rw [this, this] at h₀

  -- Now the equation becomes: $(x + 4)^2 - 16 + (y - 3)^2 - 9 = 0$ which simplifies to: $(x + 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 25$.

  have : (x + 4) ^ 2 - 4 ^ 2 + ((y - 3) ^ 2 - 3 ^ 2) = (x + 4) ^ 2 + (y - 3) ^ 2 - 5 ^ 2 := by ring
  rw [this] at h₀

  -- So the radius of the circle is 5.
