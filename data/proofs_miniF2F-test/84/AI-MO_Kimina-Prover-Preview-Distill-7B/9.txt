-- We will find the radius of the given circle and prove it is 5.

  -- The given equation is $x^2 + 8x + y^2 - 6y = 0$.

  -- To find the radius, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle: $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$.

  -- We complete the square for both x and y:

  -- For x: $x^2 + 8x$ becomes $(x + 4)^2 - 16$

  -- For y: $y^2 - 6y$ becomes $(y - 3)^2 - 9$

  -- So the equation becomes: $(x + 4)^2 - 16 + (y - 3)^2 - 9 = 0$

  -- Simplifying: $(x + 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 25 = 5^2$
