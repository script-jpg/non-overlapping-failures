-- We will complete the square for both $x$ and $y$ terms.

  -- For $x$ terms: $x^2 + 8x$, we add and subtract $(8/2)^2 = 16$.
  have : x ^ 2 + 8 * x = (x + 4) ^ 2 - 16 := by ring

  -- For $y$ terms: $y^2 - 6y$, we add and subtract $(-6/2)^2 = 9$.
  have : y ^ 2 - 6 * y = (y - 3) ^ 2 - 9 := by ring

  -- Substitute the completed squares into the equation.

  -- Now the equation becomes $(x + 4)^2 - 16 + (y - 3)^2 - 9 = 0$.
  -- Simplifying, we get $(x + 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 25 = 5^2$.
