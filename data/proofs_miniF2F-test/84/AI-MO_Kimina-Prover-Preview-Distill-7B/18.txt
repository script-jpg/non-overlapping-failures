-- We first try to find the radius of the circle given by $x^2 + 8x + y^2 - 6y = 0$. To do this, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle, $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$.

  -- To complete the square for the $x$ terms, we take $x^2 + 8x$ and add $(\frac{8}{2})^2 = 16$.
  have h₁ : x ^ 2 + 8 * x = (x + 4) ^ 2 - 16 := by ring

  -- To complete the square for the $y$ terms, we take $y^2 - 6y$ and add $(\frac{-6}{2})^2 = 9$.
  have h₂ : y ^ 2 - 6 * y = (y - 3) ^ 2 - 9 := by ring

  -- Substituting these into the original equation, we get:
  rw [h₁, h₂] at h₀

  -- Now our equation becomes: $(x + 4)^2 - 16 + (y - 3)^2 - 9 = 0$, which simplifies to: $(x + 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 25$.
