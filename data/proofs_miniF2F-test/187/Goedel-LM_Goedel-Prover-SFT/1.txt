  To determine the modulo 4 remainder of the sum \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12\), we first compute the sum using the formula for the sum of the first \(n\) integers, which is \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\). For \(n = 12\), this sum is \(\frac{12 \cdot 13}{2} = 78\). We then find the remainder of 78 when divided by 4. Since \(78 = 4 \cdot 19 + 2\), the remainder is 2.

  -- The sum of the first 12 integers is 78.
  -- We need to find the remainder of 78 when divided by 4.
  -- Since 78 = 4 * 19 + 2, the remainder is 2.
