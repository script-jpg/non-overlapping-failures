  To determine the modulo 4 remainder of the sum \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12\), we first calculate the sum of the first 12 natural numbers. The sum of the first \(n\) natural numbers is given by the formula \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\). For \(n = 12\), this sum is \(\frac{12 \cdot 13}{2} = 78\).
  Next, we find the remainder of 78 when divided by 4. We perform the division \(78 \div 4\) to find the quotient and the remainder. The quotient is 19, and the remainder is 2, since \(78 = 4 \cdot 19 + 2\).
  Thus, the modulo 4 remainder of the sum \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12\) is 2.

  -- Calculate the sum of the first 12 natural numbers: 1 + 2 + 3 +... + 12 = 78.
  -- The sum of the first 12 natural numbers is 78.
  -- Find the remainder of 78 when divided by 4.
  -- 78 ÷ 4 = 19 remainder 2, so the remainder is 2.
