  To determine the modulo 4 remainder of the sum \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12\), we first compute the sum of these numbers. The sum is \(78\). Next, we find the remainder of \(78\) when divided by \(4\). We perform the division: \(78 \div 4 = 19\) remainder \(2\). Therefore, \(78 \equiv 2 \pmod{4}\).
