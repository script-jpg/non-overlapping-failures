  To determine the modulo 4 remainder of the sum \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12\), we first calculate the sum of these numbers. The sum is \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 = 78\). Next, we find the remainder of 78 when divided by 4. We perform the division: \(78 \div 4 = 19\) remainder \(2\). Therefore, \(78 \equiv 2 \pmod{4}\). Thus, the modulo 4 remainder of the sum is 2.
