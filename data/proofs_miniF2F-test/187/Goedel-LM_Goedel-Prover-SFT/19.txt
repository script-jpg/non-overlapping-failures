  To determine the modulo 4 remainder of the sum \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12\), we first calculate the sum of these numbers. The sum is given by the formula for the sum of the first \(n\) natural numbers, which is \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\). For \(n = 12\), this sum is \(\frac{12 \cdot 13}{2} = 78\).
  Next, we need to find the remainder of 78 when divided by 4. We perform the division: \(78 \div 4 = 19\) with a remainder of 2. Therefore, \(78 \equiv 2 \pmod{4}\).
  Thus, the modulo 4 remainder of the sum \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12\) is 2.
