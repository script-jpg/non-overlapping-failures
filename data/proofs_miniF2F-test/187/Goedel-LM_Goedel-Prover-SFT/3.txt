  To determine the modulo 4 remainder of the sum \( 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 \), we first compute the sum of the sequence. The sum of the first 12 natural numbers is given by the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, which is \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \), where \( n = 12 \). Thus, the sum is \( \frac{12 \cdot 13}{2} = 78 \).
  Next, we need to find \( 78 \mod 4 \). We can simplify this by noting that \( 78 = 19 \cdot 4 + 2 \). Therefore, \( 78 \mod 4 = 2 \).
