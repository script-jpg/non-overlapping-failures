  To determine the modulo 4 remainder of the sum \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12\), we first compute the sum of the first 12 natural numbers. The sum of the first \(n\) natural numbers is given by the formula \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\). For \(n = 12\), this sum is:
  \[
  \frac{12 \cdot 13}{2} = 78
  \]
  Next, we need to find the remainder of 78 when divided by 4. We perform the division:
  \[
  78 \div 4 = 19 \text{ remainder } 2
  \]
  Thus, the remainder is 2. Therefore, the modulo 4 remainder of the sum \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12\) is 2.
