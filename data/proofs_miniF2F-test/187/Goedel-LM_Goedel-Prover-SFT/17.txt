  To determine the modulo 4 remainder of the sum \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12\), we first calculate the sum of the first 12 natural numbers. The sum of the first \(n\) natural numbers is given by the formula \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\). For \(n = 12\), this sum is \(\frac{12 \cdot 13}{2} = 78\). We then find the remainder of 78 when divided by 4. Since \(78 \div 4 = 19\) remainder 2, the remainder is 2.
