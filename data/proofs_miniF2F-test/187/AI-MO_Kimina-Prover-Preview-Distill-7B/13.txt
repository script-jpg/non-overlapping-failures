-- We compute the sum in 2 ways. The first is direct:
  have h₁ : ∑ k ∈ Finset.Icc 1 12, k = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 := by
    norm_num [Finset.sum_Icc_succ_top]

  -- The second is using the formula for an arithmetic series: $ \frac{n(n+1)}{2}.$ We will prove this as a lemma.
  have h₂ (n : ℕ) : ∑ k ∈ Finset.Icc 1 n, k = (n * (n + 1)) / 2 := by
    induction n with
    | zero =>
      simp
    | succ n ih =>
      rw [Finset.sum_Icc_succ_top (by linarith), ih]
      ring_nf
      omega

  -- We then apply the lemma to $ n = 12 $ and combine it with the first proof.
  have h₃ : ∑ k ∈ Finset.Icc 1 12, k = 78 := by
    specialize h₂ 12
    norm_num at h₂
    exact h₂
