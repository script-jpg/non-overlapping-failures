This Lean 4 proof calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 12, then determines the remainder when divided by 4. Let's break down the key steps:

1. **Sum Calculation**: The Lean proof uses `norm_num [Finset.sum_Icc_succ_top]` to compute the sum of numbers from 1 to 12. This tactic is powerful for arithmetic calculations. It likely expands the sum to `1 + 2 + 3 +... + 12` and computes its value. The formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers is `n(n + 1)/2`, so for n = 12, we get `12 × 13 / 2 = 78`.

2. **Modulo Operation**: After establishing that the sum equals 78, the Lean proof calculates `78 % 4`. The modulo operation finds the remainder of 78 divided by 4. Since 78 = 4 × 19 + 2, the remainder is 2. In Lean, the `norm_num` tactic can compute this directly.

3. **Conclusion**: The Lean proof shows that the modulo 4 remainder of the sum is 2, which is exactly what we expected from our manual calculation.

The Lean code is quite concise because Lean's automation can handle arithmetic calculations efficiently. The key insight is that the sum of numbers from 1 to 12 is 78, and 78 modulo 4 is 2.
