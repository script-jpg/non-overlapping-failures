    -- The `Finset.sum_Icc_succ_top` is applied to convert the sum to a simple arithmetic expression.
    -- The value `p` is the upper bound (12 in our case), `q` is the lower bound (1 in our case), and `f` is the function applied to each element (the identity function in our case).
    -- The sum $\sum_{k=1}^{12} k$ equals $\frac{12 \cdot 13}{2}$, which is a well-known formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers.
