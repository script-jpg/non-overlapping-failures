-- We want to compute the sum $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12$ modulo 4.
  -- First, let's calculate the sum directly by adding the numbers:
  have h1 : ∑ k in Finset.Icc 1 12, k = 78 := by
    calc
      ∑ k in Finset.Icc 1 12, k = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 := by rfl
      _ = 78 := by norm_num
  -- Now, we compute $78 \bmod 4$.
  calc
    (∑ k in Finset.Icc 1 12, k) % 4 = 78 % 4 := by rw [h1]
    _ = 2 := by norm_num
