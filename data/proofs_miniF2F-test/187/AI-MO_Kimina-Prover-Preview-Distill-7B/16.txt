The Lean 4 proof is remarkably concise because Lean has powerful automation for computational goals. The proof proceeds by:
1. Unfolding the definition of the sum of numbers from 1 to 12
2. Computing the sum explicitly
3. Calculating the remainder when divided by 4

The Lean proof uses `Finset.sum_Icc_succ_top` repeatedly to expand the sum into individual terms. This is Lean's way of handling finite set sums over intervals. After expanding all the terms, it uses `Finset.sum_range_succ` to compute the actual sum. Finally, `norm_num` is able to compute the arithmetic and verify that the remainder is indeed 2.

In more detail:
- The sum $1 + 2 + 3 + \dots + 12$ can be computed as $\frac{12 \cdot 13}{2} = 78$
- To find $78 \bmod 4$, we compute $78 \div 4 = 19$ with a remainder of $2$
- Therefore, $78 \bmod 4 = 2$

The Lean proof is elegant because it demonstrates how Lean can directly compute arithmetic facts that would typically require manual calculation in a less automated system. The proof is completely computational, with Lean's automation handling all the steps that we would do by hand.
