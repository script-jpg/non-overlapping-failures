-- We could compute the sum first and then take modulo 4, but it's not necessary.
  -- We know that $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 = 78$.
  -- And $78 = 4 \cdot 19 + 2$, so $78 \equiv 2 \pmod{4}$.

The theorem states that the sum of integers from 1 to 12 has a remainder of 2 when divided by 4. The proof uses `simp` with several lemmas:
- `Finset.sum_Icc_succ_top`: This helps compute the sum of a sequence by using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. It's likely being used to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 12.
- `Nat.add_mod`: This handles modular addition, which is the process of adding numbers and then taking the remainder modulo 4.
- `Nat.mul_mod`: This handles modular multiplication, which is the process of multiplying numbers and then taking the remainder modulo 4.

Together, these lemmas allow Lean to compute the sum (1 + 2 + 3 +... + 12), calculate the remainder when divided by 4, and verify that it equals 2. The beauty of this proof is that it avoids explicitly calculating the entire sum before taking the modulo, instead breaking the problem down into smaller steps that can be verified incrementally.
</-- Determine the modulo 4 remainder of the following sum: $$ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12. $$ Show that it is 2.-/
