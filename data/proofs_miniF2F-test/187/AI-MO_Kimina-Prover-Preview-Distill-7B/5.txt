  -- $1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + 12 = \frac{12 \cdot 13}{2} = 6 \cdot 13 = 78$.
  -- Alternatively, we can use `Finset.sum_Icc_succ_top` to calculate the sum directly.

  -- To compute $78 \bmod 4$, we can observe that $78 = 4 \cdot 19 + 2$, so the remainder is 2.
  -- Now, we can combine the above results to conclude that the modulo 4 remainder of the sum is 2.
