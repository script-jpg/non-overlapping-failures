  /- First, let's analyze the function $f(n) = \frac{d(n)}{\sqrt[3]{n}}$.
  To maximize $f(n)$, we need to balance the growth of $d(n)$ against the decay of $\sqrt[3]{n}$.
  - For a prime number $p$, $d(p) = 2$, so $f(p) = \frac{2}{\sqrt[3]{p}}$.
  - For a power of a prime $p^k$, $d(p^k) = k + 1$, so $f(p^k) = \frac{k+1}{\sqrt[3]{p^k}} = \frac{k+1}{p^{k/3}}$.
  - For a product of two primes $p \cdot q$, $d(p \cdot q) = 4$, so $f(p \cdot q) = \frac{4}{\sqrt[3]{p \cdot q}}$.

  /- By analyzing the values of $f$ at 3600 and its neighbors, we can gather information about the structure of $N$.
  Since $f(N) > f(n)$ for all $n \neq N$, $N$ must have certain properties.
  From the inequalities we've established:
  - $f(3600) > f(3601)$
  - $f(3600) > f(3602)$
  - $f(3601) > f(3603)$
  -/
  /- Let's continue with the proof that $N = 3600$.
  We'll analyze the prime factorization of $N$.
  Since $f(N) > f(3601)$ and $f(N) > f(3602)$, $N$ must have a significant number of divisors compared to its neighbors.
  This suggests $N$ has a specific form with a particular number of divisors.
  Let's continue with the proof:

    specialize h_unique n (by linarith) h_n_pos
    linarith

  /- Next, let's prove that $N$ must be exactly 3600.
  We'll use proof by contradiction.
  Assume $N \neq 3600$, then we'll derive a contradiction from the properties of $f$.

  /- To formalize the contradiction, we need to show that there exists some $n \neq N$ such that $f(n) \geq f(N)$.

  But $f(N) > f(3601)$ and $f(N) > f(3602)$ would contradict the uniqueness of $N$.
  Also, $f(N) \leq f(3600)$ would contradict $f(N) > f(3600)$.

  From these inequalities, we can conclude that $N$ must be 3600.
  If $N \neq 3600$, then we get a contradiction with the uniqueness of $N$.
