-- We start by analyzing the function \( f(n) = \frac{d(n)}{\sqrt[3]{n}} \), where \( d(n) \) is the number of divisors of \( n \).

  -- **Step 1: Understanding the function \( f(n) \)**

  -- The function \( f(n) \) combines the number of divisors with the cube root of \( n \). To find the maximum \( f(n) \), we need to find the right balance between these two factors.

  -- **Step 2: Analyzing the problem constraints**

  -- We are given that there is a unique positive integer \( N \) such that \( f(N) > f(n) \) for all \( n \neq N \). This means \( N \) is the " maximum " of \( f(n) \).

  -- **Step 3: Considering the approach**

  -- Given the constraint in the theorem statement, we need to prove that the sum of digits of \( N \) is 9.

  -- **Step 4: Proving the theorem**

  -- Since this is a uniqueness problem, we need to:
  -- 1. Show that \( N \) exists and satisfies the properties
  -- 2. Show that any other number cannot satisfy the properties

  -- Since the formal theorem statement already provides the existence of \( N \) and the property \( h₁ \), we can directly work with these assumptions.

  -- The above establish the positivity of the relevant expressions.
  -- Step 2: Consider the case where \( N \) is a power of a single prime

  -- To maximize \( f(n) \), we should consider how \( d(n) \) and \( \sqrt[3]{n} \) behave. For a prime power \( p^k \), we have:
  -- - \( d(p^k) = k + 1 \)
  -- - \( \sqrt[3]{p^k} = p^{k/3} \)

  -- Therefore, \( f(p^k) = \frac{k+1}{p^{k/3}} \).

  -- Step 3: Find the prime power that maximizes \( f(n) \)

  -- Let's analyze some prime powers:
  -- - For \( p = 2 \): \( f(2^6) = \frac{7}{8^{1/3}} = \frac{7}{2} = 3.5 \)
  -- - For \( p = 3 \): \( f(3^4) = \frac{5}{3^{4/3}} \approx \frac{5}{3.98} \approx 1.25 \)
  -- - For \( p = 5 \): \( f(5^3) = \frac{4}{5^{3/3}} = \frac{4}{5} = 0.8 \)

  -- It appears that \( 2^6 = 64 \) is a strong candidate. However, further analysis is needed for certain cases.

  -- Step 4: Consider the general case

  -- For a general \( N \) with prime factorization \( N = p_1^{k_1} p_2^{k_2} \cdots p_m^{k_m} \), we have:
  -- - \( d(N) = (k_1 + 1)(k_2 + 1) \cdots (k_m + 1) \)
  -- - \( \sqrt[3]{N} = p_1^{k_1/3} p_2^{k_2/3} \cdots p_m^{k_m/3} \)

  -- Therefore, \( f(N) = \frac{(k_1 + 1)(k_2 + 1) \cdots (k_m + 1)}{p_1^{k_1/3} p_2^{k_2/3} \cdots p_m^{k_m/3}} \).

  -- Step 5: Analyze the limit of \( f(n) \) as \( n \to \infty \)

  -- If \( n \to \infty \) with \( n \neq N \), we can show that \( f(n) \to 0 \). This is because eventually, the number of divisors \( d(n) \) will be overtaken by the cube root factor \( \sqrt[3]{n} \).

  -- Step 6: Establish the uniqueness of \( N \)

  -- The property that \( f(N) > f(n) \) for all \( n \neq N \) implies that \( N \) must be unique. If there were another number \( M \) with the same property, then \( f(M) > f(n) \) for all \( n \neq M \), which would contradict the uniqueness of \( N \).

  -- Step 7: Determine the value of \( N \)

  -- Based on our analysis of prime powers and the requirement that \( f(N) \) must be greater than \( f(n) \) for all \( n \neq N \), the unique solution is \( N = 2^6 = 64 \).
