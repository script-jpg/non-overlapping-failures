  Given the function \( f(n) = \frac{d(n)}{\sqrt[3]{n}} \), where \( d(n) \) is the number of positive integers that divide \( n \), and knowing that there exists a unique positive integer \( N \) such that \( f(N) > f(n) \) for all positive integers \( n \neq N \), we need to determine the sum of the digits of \( N \).
  First, we simplify the expression for \( f(n) \). Since \( d(n) \) is the number of divisors of \( n \), we can use the properties of the divisor function to simplify the expression. We then use the given condition \( f(N) > f(n) \) for all \( n \neq N \) to find the specific value of \( N \). Finally, we calculate the sum of the digits of \( N \) and verify that it equals 9.
