  To solve the problem, we need to find the unique positive integer \( N \) such that for all positive integers \( n \neq N \), \( f(N) > f(n) \), where \( f(n) = \frac{d(n)}{\sqrt[3]{n}} \) and \( d(n) \) denotes the number of positive integers that divide \( n \). We then need to determine the sum of the digits of \( N \).
  
  Given the properties of the divisor function \( d(n) \) and the function \( f(n) \), we can deduce that the unique \( N \) that satisfies the condition is 9. The sum of the digits of 9 is calculated as follows:
  \[ 9 = 9 \]
  This is a straightforward calculation.
