  Given the function \( d(n) \) which denotes the number of positive integers that divide \( n \), including 1 and \( n \), we have \( d(1) = 1 \), \( d(2) = 2 \), and \( d(12) = 6 \). This function is known as the divisor function. We define \( f(n) = \frac{d(n)}{\sqrt[3]{n}} \). There is a unique positive integer \( N \) such that \( f(N) > f(n) \) for all positive integers \( n \neq N \). We need to determine the sum of the digits of \( N \).
