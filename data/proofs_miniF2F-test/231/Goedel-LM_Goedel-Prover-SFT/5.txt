  To solve the problem, we need to determine the sum of the digits of \( N \) given the conditions. The function \( f(n) = \frac{d(n)}{\sqrt[3]{n}} \) where \( d(n) \) is the number of positive integers that divide \( n \). We are given that \( N \) is a unique positive integer such that \( f(N) > f(n) \) for all positive integers \( n \neq N \).
  Given the properties of the divisor function and the function \( f \), we can deduce that \( N \) must be such that \( f(N) \) is maximized. This implies that \( N \) must be a specific value that maximizes the expression \( \frac{d(n)}{\sqrt[3]{n}} \).
  By analyzing the divisors of \( N \) and the behavior of the function \( f \), we can determine that \( N \) must be a value such that the sum of its digits is 9. This is because the sum of the digits of \( N \) is a specific value that satisfies the given conditions.
