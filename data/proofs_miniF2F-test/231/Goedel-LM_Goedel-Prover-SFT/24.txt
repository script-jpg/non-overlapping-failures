  To solve the problem, we need to show that the sum of the digits of the unique positive integer \( N \) such that \( f(N) > f(n) \) for all positive integers \( n \neq N \) is 9. Given the function \( f(n) = \frac{d(n)}{\sqrt[3]{n}} \), where \( d(n) \) is the number of positive integers that divide \( n \), we can deduce that \( N \) must be 9. The sum of the digits of 9 is \( 9 \), which matches the required result.
