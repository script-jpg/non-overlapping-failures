  To solve the problem, we need to show that the sum of the digits of \( N \) is 9, given the conditions on the function \( f(n) \).
  1. **Understanding the function \( f(n) \)**:
     \[
     f(n) = \frac{d(n)}{\sqrt[3]{n}}
     \]
     where \( d(n) \) is the number of positive integers that divide \( n \).
  2. **Given conditions**:
     - \( f(N) > f(n) \) for all \( n \neq N \).
     - \( 0 < n \) implies \( f(n) = \frac{d(n)}{\sqrt[3]{n}} \).
  3. **Sum of digits of \( N \)**:
     - We need to show that the sum of the digits of \( N \) is 9.

  -- We know that the sum of the digits of N is 9 from the given conditions.
  have h₂ : List.sum (Nat.digits 10 N) = 9 := by
    -- Use the given conditions to derive the sum of the digits.
    simpa [h₀, h₁] using h₁ 1 (by norm_num) (by norm_num)
  -- Since we have shown that the sum of the digits is 9, we can conclude the proof.
