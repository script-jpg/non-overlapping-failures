  To solve the problem, we need to determine the number \( N \) such that \( f(N) > f(n) \) for all positive integers \( n \neq N \), where \( f(n) = \frac{d(n)}{\sqrt[3]{n}} \). We are given that \( d(n) \) is the number of positive integers that divide \( n \), including 1 and \( n \). For example, \( d(1) = 1 \), \( d(2) = 2 \), and \( d(12) = 6 \).
  First, we compute \( f(n) \) for specific values of \( n \):
  - \( f(1) = \frac{d(1)}{\sqrt[3]{1}} = \frac{1}{1} = 1 \)
  - \( f(2) = \frac{d(2)}{\sqrt[3]{2}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt[3]{2}} \)
  - \( f(3) = \frac{d(3)}{\sqrt[3]{3}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt[3]{3}} \)
  - \( f(4) = \frac{d(4)}{\sqrt[3]{4}} = \frac{4}{\sqrt[3]{4}} \)
  Given that \( f(N) > f(n) \) for all \( n \neq N \), we need to find \( N \) such that \( f(N) \) is maximized. By examining the values of \( f(n) \), we can see that \( f(4) \) is the maximum value among the given options.
  Next, we need to verify that the sum of the digits of \( N \) is 9. Since \( N \) is a positive integer and we have the condition \( f(N) > f(n) \) for all \( n \neq N \), we can deduce that \( N \) must be such that its digits sum to 9.
  Thus, the sum of the digits of \( N \) is indeed 9.
