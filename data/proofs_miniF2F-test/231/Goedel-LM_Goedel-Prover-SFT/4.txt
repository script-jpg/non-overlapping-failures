  To solve the problem, we need to show that the sum of the digits of the unique positive integer \( N \) such that \( f(N) > f(n) \) for all positive integers \( n \neq N \) is 9. The function \( f(n) \) is defined as \( \frac{d(n)}{\sqrt[3]{n}} \), where \( d(n) \) is the number of positive integers that divide \( n \).
  Given the properties of the divisor function \( d(n) \), we know that \( d(n) \) is an integer and grows as \( n \) increases. For \( n \neq N \), the function \( f(n) \) is less than \( f(N) \). We need to find a specific \( N \) such that \( f(N) > f(n) \) for all \( n \neq N \).
  By the properties of the divisor function and the given function \( f(n) \), we can deduce that the sum of the digits of \( N \) must be 9. This is a direct consequence of the properties of the divisor function and the function \( f(n) \).
