  Given the function \( f(n) = \frac{d(n)}{\sqrt[3]{n}} \), where \( d(n) \) denotes the number of positive integers that divide \( n \), we need to find a unique positive integer \( N \) such that \( f(N) > f(n) \) for all positive integers \( n \neq N \). We also need to determine the sum of the digits of \( N \).
  To solve this, we start by analyzing the given conditions and the function \( f(n) \). The function \( f(n) \) is defined as the ratio of the number of divisors of \( n \) to the cube root of \( n \). For large \( n \), the number of divisors of \( n \) grows approximately as the product of the exponents in its prime factorization, while the cube root of \( n \) grows approximately as \( n^{1/3} \).
  Given the uniqueness condition \( f(N) > f(n) \) for all \( n \neq N \), we can infer that \( N \) must be such that \( f(N) \) is maximized. This implies that the number of divisors of \( N \) must be significantly larger than the cube root of \( N \).
  To find such an \( N \), we consider the number of divisors of \( N \). For \( N = 12 \), the number of divisors is 6, and the cube root of 12 is \( 12^{1/3} \approx 2.08 \). Clearly, \( 6 > 2.08 \), so \( f(12) > f(n) \) for all \( n \neq 12 \).
  Finally, we check the sum of the digits of 12, which is \( 1 + 2 = 3 \).
