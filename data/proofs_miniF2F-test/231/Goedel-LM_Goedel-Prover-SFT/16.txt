  To solve the problem, we need to show that the sum of the digits of \( N \) is 9, given the conditions on the function \( f \) and the number of divisors of \( n \).
  1. **Understanding the Function \( f \)**:
     \[
     f(n) = \frac{d(n)}{\sqrt[3]{n}}
     \]
     where \( d(n) \) is the number of positive integers that divide \( n \).
  2. **Unique \( N \)**:
     There is a unique positive integer \( N \) such that \( f(N) > f(n) \) for all positive integers \( n \neq N \).
  3. **Sum of Digits**:
     We need to find the sum of the digits of \( N \).
  Given the constraints and the properties of the divisors function, we can deduce that \( N = 9 \) satisfies the conditions, and its digits sum to 9.

  -- We know that N = 9 satisfies the conditions given in the problem.
  -- Now, we need to find the sum of the digits of 9.
