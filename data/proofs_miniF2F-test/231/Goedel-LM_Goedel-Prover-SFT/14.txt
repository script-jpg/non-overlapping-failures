  Given the function \( f(n) = \frac{d(n)}{\sqrt[3]{n}} \), where \( d(n) \) is the number of positive integers that divide \( n \), and \( f(n) \) is defined for positive integers \( n \), we need to find the unique positive integer \( N \) such that \( f(N) > f(n) \) for all positive integers \( n \neq N \). We are also given the condition that the sum of the digits of \( N \) is 9.

  -- We need to show that the sum of the digits of N is 9.
