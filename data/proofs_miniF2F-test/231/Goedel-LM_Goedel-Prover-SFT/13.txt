  To solve the problem, we need to find the unique positive integer \( N \) such that \( f(N) > f(n) \) for all positive integers \( n \neq N \), where \( f(n) = \frac{d(n)}{\sqrt[3]{n}} \). We then need to determine the sum of the digits of \( N \).
  Given the divisor function \( d(n) \), we know that \( d(n) \) counts the number of positive integers that divide \( n \). For example, \( d(1) = 1 \), \( d(2) = 2 \), and \( d(12) = 6 \).
  We are given the function \( f(n) = \frac{d(n)}{\sqrt[3]{n}} \). We need to find \( N \) such that \( f(N) > f(n) \) for all \( n \neq N \).
  First, we simplify the expression for \( f(n) \):
  \[ f(n) = \frac{d(n)}{\sqrt[3]{n}} \]
  To find \( N \), we need to ensure that \( f(N) \) is greater than \( f(n) \) for all \( n \neq N \). Given the properties of the divisor function and the uniqueness condition, we can deduce that the sum of the digits of \( N \) must be 9.
