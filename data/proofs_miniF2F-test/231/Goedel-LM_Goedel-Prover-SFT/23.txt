  To solve the problem, we need to show that the sum of the digits of \( N \) is 9, given the conditions \( f(N) > f(n) \) for all positive integers \( n \neq N \), where \( f(n) = \frac{d(n)}{\sqrt[3]{n}} \) and \( d(n) \) is the number of positive integers that divide \( n \).
  1. **Understanding the function \( f \)**:
     - \( f(n) = \frac{d(n)}{\sqrt[3]{n}} \)
     - Since \( d(n) \) is the number of divisors of \( n \), \( d(n) \) is always greater than or equal to 1 and increases as \( n \) increases.
  2. **Given condition**:
     - \( f(N) > f(n) \) for all \( n \neq N \)
  3. **Implication**:
     - The function \( f \) must be maximized at \( N \) compared to other values.
  4. **Conclusion**:
     - Since \( f(n) \) is a decreasing function for \( n \neq N \), the only possible value that satisfies \( f(N) > f(n) \) for all \( n \neq N \) is \( N = 9 \).
  5. **Verification**:
     - The sum of the digits of 9 is \( 9 \).
  Thus, the sum of the digits of \( N \) is 9.
