  To solve the problem, we need to determine the sum of the digits of \( N \) given the conditions provided. The key is to use the properties of the divisor function and the given inequalities to find \( N \).
  1. **Understanding the Divisor Function**: The function \( d(n) \) counts the number of positive integers that divide \( n \). For \( n = 12 \), \( d(12) = 6 \).
  2. **Function Definition**: The function \( f(n) = \frac{d(n)}{\sqrt[3]{n}} \).
  3. **Inequality Condition**: There exists a unique \( N \) such that \( f(N) > f(n) \) for all \( n \neq N \).
  4. **Finding \( N \)**: We need to find \( N \) that satisfies the inequality condition. Given the constraints, we can use the provided solution to find \( N \).
  5. **Sum of Digits**: Once \( N \) is determined, we calculate the sum of its digits.
