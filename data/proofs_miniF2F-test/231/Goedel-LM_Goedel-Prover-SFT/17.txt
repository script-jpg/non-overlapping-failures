  Given the function \( f(n) = \frac{d(n)}{\sqrt[3]{n}} \), where \( d(n) \) denotes the number of positive integers that divide \( n \), we need to find a unique positive integer \( N \) such that \( f(N) > f(n) \) for all positive integers \( n \neq N \). We are also given that the sum of the digits of \( N \) is 9.
