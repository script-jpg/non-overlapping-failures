  To solve the problem, we need to show that the sum of the digits of \( N \) is 9, given the function \( f(n) = \frac{d(n)}{\sqrt[3]{n}} \) and the condition that \( f(N) > f(n) \) for all \( n \neq N \).
  1. **Definition of Divisor Function**: The divisor function \( d(n) \) counts the number of positive integers that divide \( n \), including 1 and \( n \).
  2. **Function Definition**: The function \( f(n) = \frac{d(n)}{\sqrt[3]{n}} \) is defined as the ratio of the divisor count to the cube root of \( n \).
  3. **Unique Maximum**: There exists a unique positive integer \( N \) such that \( f(N) > f(n) \) for all \( n \neq N \).
  4. **Digit Sum Calculation**: We need to show that the sum of the digits of \( N \) is 9.
