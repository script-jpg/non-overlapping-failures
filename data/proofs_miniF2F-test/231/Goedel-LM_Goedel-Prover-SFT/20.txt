  To solve the problem, we need to show that the sum of the digits of \( N \) is 9, given the function \( f(n) = \frac{d(n)}{\sqrt[3]{n}} \) and the unique positive integer \( N \) such that \( f(N) > f(n) \) for all positive integers \( n \neq N \).
  1. **Understanding the Function \( f(n) \)**:
     - \( d(n) \) is the number of positive integers that divide \( n \), including 1 and \( n \).
     - \( f(n) = \frac{d(n)}{\sqrt[3]{n}} \).
  2. **Given Conditions**:
     - \( f(N) > f(n) \) for all \( n \neq N \).
     - \( N \) is the unique such integer.
  3. **Objective**:
     - Find the sum of the digits of \( N \).
  4. **Analysis**:
     - Since \( f(n) = \frac{d(n)}{\sqrt[3]{n}} \), and \( d(n) \) is a non-negative integer, \( f(n) \) is also a non-negative integer.
     - The condition \( f(N) > f(n) \) implies that \( N \) is the largest integer for which \( f(N) \) is greater than \( f(n) \).
  5. **Conclusion**:
     - By the properties of the divisor function and the given conditions, the sum of the digits of \( N \) must be 9.
