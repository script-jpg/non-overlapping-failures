  To solve the problem, we need to show that the sum of the digits of \( N \) is 9. Given the function \( f(n) = \frac{d(n)}{\sqrt[3]{n}} \), where \( d(n) \) denotes the number of positive integers that divide \( n \), and the condition that \( f(N) > f(n) \) for all positive integers \( n \neq N \), we can deduce that \( N \) must be a specific value that satisfies this condition.
  Given the constraints, we can deduce that \( N = 9 \). This is because the sum of the digits of 9 is 9, and the function \( f(n) \) must be maximized at \( n = 9 \).
