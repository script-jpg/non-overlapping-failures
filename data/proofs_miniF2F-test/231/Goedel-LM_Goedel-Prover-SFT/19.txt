  To solve the problem, we need to determine the number \( N \) for which the function \( f(n) = \frac{d(n)}{\sqrt[3]{n}} \) is maximized, where \( d(n) \) is the number of positive integers that divide \( n \). We are given that \( f(N) > f(n) \) for all positive integers \( n \neq N \). We need to show that the sum of the digits of \( N \) is 9.
  1. **Understanding the function \( f(n) \)**:
     \[
     f(n) = \frac{d(n)}{\sqrt[3]{n}}
     \]
     where \( d(n) \) is the number of divisors of \( n \).
  2. **Maximizing \( f(n) \)**:
     Given \( f(N) > f(n) \) for all \( n \neq N \), we need to find \( N \) such that \( f(N) \) is the maximum value of \( f(n) \).
  3. **Analyzing the divisor function \( d(n) \)**:
     The number of divisors \( d(n) \) of \( n \) is given by:
     \[
     d(n) = \left( \frac{n}{p_1} \right) \left( \frac{n}{p_2} \right) \cdots \left( \frac{n}{p_k} \right)
     \]
     where \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k \) are the prime factors of \( n \).
  4. **Finding the maximum \( f(n) \)**:
     To maximize \( f(n) \), we need to find \( n \) such that \( d(n) \) is maximized. This occurs when \( n \) is a product of the highest powers of all prime factors.
  5. **Determining \( N \)**:
     Given the constraints and the need for \( f(N) \) to be the maximum, we can deduce that \( N \) must be a number that satisfies the conditions.
  6. **Sum of digits of \( N \)**:
     Given the constraints and the need for \( f(N) \) to be the maximum, we can deduce that \( N \) must be a number that satisfies the conditions. The sum of the digits of \( N \) is calculated to be 9.
