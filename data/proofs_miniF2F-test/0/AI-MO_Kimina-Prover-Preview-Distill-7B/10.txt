-- The volume of a cone is given by the formula $V = \frac{1}{3}Bh$, where $B$ is the area of the base and $h$ is the height.
  rw [h₁, h₂, h₃]
  -- The area of the base of a cone is 30 square units, and its height is 6.5 units.

  -- What is the number of cubic units in its volume? Show that it is 65.
  -- 6.5 = 13/2.
  -- (13/2) * 30 = 195.
  -- 195 * (1/3) = 65.
  -- Thus, the volume of the cone is 65 cubic units.
