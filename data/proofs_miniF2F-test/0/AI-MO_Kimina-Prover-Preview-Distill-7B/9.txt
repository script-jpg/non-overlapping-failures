In this proof, we're given that:
- The volume of a cone is $v = \frac{1}{3} \cdot B \cdot h$ (where $B$ is the base area, $h$ is the height)
- The base area $B = 30$ square units
- The height $h = 6.5$ units

First, we substitute the given values for $B$ and $h$ into the formula for $v$:
- $v = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 30 \cdot 6.5$
- $v = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 195$
- $v = 65$

The Lean proof follows these steps:
1. It establishes that $b \cdot h = 30 \cdot \frac{13}{2}$ by substituting the given values for $b$ and $h$.
2. It then substitutes $v = \frac{1}{3} \cdot (b \cdot h)$ and $b \cdot h = 30 \cdot \frac{13}{2}$ into the goal.
3. The `linarith` tactic is able to compute that $\frac{1}{3} \cdot 30 \cdot \frac{13}{2} = 65$.
4. Therefore, it proves that $v = 65$, which is the number of cubic units in the volume of the cone.

The key insight is that the volume of a cone is one-third the volume of a cylinder with the same base and height. The volume of a cylinder is $B \cdot h$, so the volume of a cone is $\frac{1}{3} \cdot B \cdot h$. This formula is derived from the idea that you can decompose a cylinder into three congruent pyramids, each with the same base and height as the cylinder.

/-- The volume of a cone is given by the formula $V = \frac{1}{3}Bh$, where $B$ is the area of the base and $h$ is the height. The area of the base of a cone is 30 square units, and its height is 6.5 units. What is the number of cubic units in its volume? Show that it is 65.-/
