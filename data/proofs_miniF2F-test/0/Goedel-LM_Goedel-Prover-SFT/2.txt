  To prove that the volume of a cone with base area \( B = 30 \) square units and height \( h = 6.5 \) units is \( 65 \) cubic units, we use the formula for the volume of a cone \( V = \frac{1}{3}Bh \).
  1. Substitute \( B = 30 \) and \( h = 6.5 \) into the volume formula.
  2. Calculate the product \( 30 \times 6.5 \).
  3. Multiply the result by \( \frac{1}{3} \) to get the volume.
