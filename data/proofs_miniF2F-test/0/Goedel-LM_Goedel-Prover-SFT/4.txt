  To find the volume \( V \) of a cone, we use the formula \( V = \frac{1}{3}Bh \), where \( B \) is the area of the base and \( h \) is the height. Given that the area of the base \( B \) is 30 square units and the height \( h \) is 6.5 units, we need to show that the volume \( V \) is 65 cubic units.
  1. Substitute the given values \( B = 30 \) and \( h = \frac{13}{2} \) into the volume formula.
  2. Simplify the expression step by step to verify that \( V = 65 \).
