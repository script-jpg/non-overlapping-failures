  To solve for the volume \( V \) of a cone using the formula \( V = \frac{1}{3} B h \), where \( B \) is the area of the base and \( h \) is the height, we proceed as follows:
  1. Substitute the given values for \( B \) and \( h \).
  2. Calculate the product \( B \times h \).
  3. Multiply the result by \( \frac{1}{3} \).
  4. Verify that the final volume matches the expected value.
  Given:
  - \( B = 30 \) square units
  - \( h = 6.5 \) units
  The volume \( V \) is calculated as:
  \[ V = \frac{1}{3} \times 30 \times 6.5 \]
  First, compute \( 30 \times 6.5 \):
  \[ 30 \times 6.5 = 195 \]
  Next, multiply by \( \frac{1}{3} \):
  \[ \frac{1}{3} \times 195 = 65 \]
  Thus, the volume \( V \) is indeed 65 cubic units.
