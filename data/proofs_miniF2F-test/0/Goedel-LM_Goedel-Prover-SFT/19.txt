  To solve for the volume \( V \) of a cone, we use the formula \( V = \frac{1}{3} B h \), where \( B \) is the area of the base and \( h \) is the height. Given that the area of the base \( B \) is 30 square units and the height \( h \) is 6.5 units, we need to find the volume in cubic units.
  First, substitute the given values into the volume formula:
  \[ V = \frac{1}{3} \times 30 \times 6.5 \]
  Next, perform the multiplication:
  \[ 30 \times 6.5 = 195 \]
  Then, divide by 3:
  \[ \frac{195}{3} = 65 \]
  Thus, the volume of the cone is 65 cubic units.
