  Given the volume \( V \) of a cone is given by the formula \( V = \frac{1}{3}Bh \), where \( B \) is the area of the base and \( h \) is the height. The area of the base \( B \) is 30 square units, and the height \( h \) is 6.5 units. We need to show that the volume \( V \) is 65 cubic units.
  First, substitute the given values into the volume formula:
  \[ V = \frac{1}{3} \times 30 \times 6.5 \]
  Next, perform the multiplication:
  \[ V = \frac{1}{3} \times 30 \times 6.5 = \frac{1}{3} \times 210 = 65 \]
  Thus, the volume \( V \) is indeed 65 cubic units.
