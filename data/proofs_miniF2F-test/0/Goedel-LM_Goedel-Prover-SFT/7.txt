  To solve for the volume \( V \) of a cone, we use the formula \( V = \frac{1}{3}Bh \), where \( B \) is the area of the base and \( h \) is the height. Given that the area of the base \( B \) is 30 square units and the height \( h \) is 6.5 units, we substitute these values into the formula.
  First, substitute \( B = 30 \) and \( h = \frac{13}{2} \) into the volume formula:
  \[ V = \frac{1}{3} \times 30 \times \frac{13}{2} \]
  Next, perform the multiplication:
  \[ V = \frac{1}{3} \times 30 \times \frac{13}{2} = \frac{1}{3} \times 30 \times 6.5 = \frac{1}{3} \times 205 = \frac{205}{3} \]
  Finally, simplify the fraction:
  \[ V = \frac{205}{3} = 65 \]
  Thus, the volume of the cone is 65 cubic units.
