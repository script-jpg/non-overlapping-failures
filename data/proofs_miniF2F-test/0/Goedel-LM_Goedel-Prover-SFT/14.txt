  To prove that the volume of a cone is 65 cubic units given the base area \( B = 30 \) square units and height \( h = 6.5 \) units, we proceed as follows:
  1. Substitute the given values \( B = 30 \) and \( h = 6.5 \) into the volume formula \( V = \frac{1}{3} B h \).
  2. Simplify the expression step by step.
  3. Verify that the resulting volume matches the expected value of 65 cubic units.
