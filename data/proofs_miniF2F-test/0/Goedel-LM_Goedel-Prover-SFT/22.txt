  To prove that the volume \( V \) of a cone is 65 cubic units given the base area \( B = 30 \) square units and height \( h = 6.5 \) units, we start by using the formula for the volume of a cone \( V = \frac{1}{3} B h \). Substituting the given values into this formula, we get:
  \[ V = \frac{1}{3} \times 30 \times 6.5 \]
  First, we simplify the multiplication:
  \[ V = \frac{1}{3} \times 210 \]
  Next, we perform the division:
  \[ V = \frac{210}{3} \]
  Finally, we compute the result:
  \[ V = 65 \]
  Thus, the volume of the cone is indeed 65 cubic units.
