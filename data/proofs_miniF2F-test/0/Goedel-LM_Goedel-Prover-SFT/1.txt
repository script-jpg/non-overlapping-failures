  To prove that the volume of a cone with base area 30 square units and height 6.5 units is 65 cubic units, we start by using the formula for the volume of a cone, which is given by \( V = \frac{1}{3}Bh \), where \( B \) is the area of the base and \( h \) is the height. Given the base area \( B = 30 \) square units and the height \( h = 6.5 \) units, we substitute these values into the volume formula.
  First, we substitute \( B = 30 \) and \( h = 6.5 \) into the volume formula:
  \[ V = \frac{1}{3} \times 30 \times 6.5 \]
  Next, we perform the multiplication:
  \[ 30 \times 6.5 = 195 \]
  Then, we multiply the result by \( \frac{1}{3} \):
  \[ \frac{1}{3} \times 195 = 65 \]
  Thus, the volume \( V \) of the cone is 65 cubic units.
