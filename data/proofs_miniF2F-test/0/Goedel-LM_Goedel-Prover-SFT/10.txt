  To prove that the volume of a cone with base area \( B = 30 \) square units and height \( h = \frac{13}{2} \) units is \( v = 65 \) cubic units, we start by using the formula for the volume of a cone \( V = \frac{1}{3}Bh \). Substituting the given values into this formula, we get:
  \[
  V = \frac{1}{3} \times 30 \times \frac{13}{2}
  \]
  First, we perform the multiplication:
  \[
  30 \times \frac{13}{2} = 30 \times 6.5 = 195
  \]
  Next, we divide by 3:
  \[
  \frac{195}{3} = 65
  \]
  Thus, the volume \( v \) is indeed \( 65 \) cubic units.
