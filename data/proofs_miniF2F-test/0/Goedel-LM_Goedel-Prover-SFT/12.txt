  To find the volume of a cone, we use the formula \( V = \frac{1}{3}Bh \), where \( B \) is the area of the base and \( h \) is the height. Given that the area of the base is 30 square units and the height is 6.5 units, we need to show that the volume is 65 cubic units.
  1. Substitute the given values \( B = 30 \) and \( h = 6.5 \) into the volume formula \( V = \frac{1}{3}Bh \).
  2. Calculate the volume using the substituted values:
     \[
     V = \frac{1}{3} \times 30 \times 6.5
     \]
  3. Perform the multiplication:
     \[
     V = \frac{1}{3} \times 210 = 65
     \]
  Thus, the volume of the cone is indeed 65 cubic units.
