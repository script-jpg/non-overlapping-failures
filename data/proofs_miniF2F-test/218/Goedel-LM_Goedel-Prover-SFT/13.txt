  To find the remainder when \(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + \dots + 2^{100}\) is divided by 7, we start by recognizing that the sum is a geometric series. The sum of a geometric series \(a + ar + ar^2 + \cdots + ar^n\) is given by \(a \frac{r^{n+1} - 1}{r - 1}\). In this case, \(a = 1\) and \(r = 2\). Thus, the sum is \(\frac{2^{101} - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^{101} - 1\).
  Next, we need to determine the remainder of \(2^{101} - 1\) when divided by 7. We can simplify this by noting that \(2^3 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}\). Therefore, \(2^{101} = (2^3)^{33} \cdot 2^2 \equiv 1^{33} \cdot 2^2 \equiv 2^2 \pmod{7}\).
  Calculating \(2^2 \pmod{7}\):
  \[ 2^2 = 4 \]
  Thus, \(2^{101} \equiv 4 \pmod{7}\).
  Now, we have:
  \[ 2^{101} - 1 \equiv 4 - 1 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \]
  Therefore, the remainder when \(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + \dots + 2^{100}\) is divided by 7 is 3.
