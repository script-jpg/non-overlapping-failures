  To find the remainder when \(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + \dots + 2^{100}\) is divided by 7, we first express the sum as a geometric series:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{100} 2^k = \frac{2^{101} - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^{101} - 1
  \]
  Next, we compute the remainder of \(2^{101} - 1\) when divided by 7. We simplify \(2^{101} \mod 7\) by noting that:
  \[
  2^3 \equiv 1 \mod 7 \implies 2^{101} = 2^{3 \cdot 33 + 2} = (2^3)^{33} \cdot 2^2 \equiv 1^{33} \cdot 2^2 \equiv 2^2 \mod 7
  \]
  Thus,
  \[
  2^{101} - 1 \equiv 2^2 - 1 \equiv 4 - 1 \equiv 3 \mod 7
  \]
  Therefore, the remainder when \(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + \dots + 2^{100}\) is divided by 7 is 3.
