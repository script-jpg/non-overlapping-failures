  To find the remainder when \(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + \dots + 2^{100}\) is divided by 7, we first recognize that this is a geometric series with the first term \(a = 1\) and common ratio \(r = 2\). The sum of the first \(n\) terms of a geometric series is given by the formula:
  \[
  S_n = a \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1}
  \]
  Substituting the values \(a = 1\), \(r = 2\), and \(n = 101\), we get:
  \[
  S_{101} = 1 \frac{2^{101} - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^{101} - 1
  \]
  Next, we need to find the remainder of \(2^{101} - 1\) when divided by 7. We can use modular arithmetic to simplify this calculation. We know that:
  \[
  2^3 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
  \]
  Thus, we can express \(2^{101}\) in terms of \(2^3\):
  \[
  2^{101} = 2^{3 \cdot 33 + 2} = (2^3)^{33} \cdot 2^2 \equiv 1^{33} \cdot 2^2 \equiv 2^2 \pmod{7}
  \]
  Since \(2^2 = 4\), we have:
  \[
  2^{101} \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
  \]
  Therefore, the remainder when \(2^{101} - 1\) is divided by 7 is:
  \[
  2^{101} - 1 \equiv 4 - 1 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}
  \]

  -- Simplify the expression using modular arithmetic to find the remainder.
  -- We know that 2^3 ≡ 1 (mod 7), so we can simplify 2^101 modulo 7.
  -- 2^101 = 2^(3*33 + 2) = (2^3)^33 * 2^2 ≡ 1^33 * 2^2 ≡ 2^2 (mod 7).
  -- Since 2^2 = 4, we have 2^101 ≡ 4 (mod 7).
  -- Therefore, the remainder when 2^101 - 1 is divided by 7 is 4 - 1 ≡ 3 (mod 7).
