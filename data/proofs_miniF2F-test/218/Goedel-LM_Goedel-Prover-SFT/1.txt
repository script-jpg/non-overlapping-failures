  To find the remainder when the sum \(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + \dots + 2^{100}\) is divided by 7, we can use properties of modular arithmetic. Specifically, we will compute the sum modulo 7.
  First, observe that the powers of 2 modulo 7 cycle every 3 steps:
  - \(2^1 \equiv 2 \mod 7\)
  - \(2^2 \equiv 4 \mod 7\)
  - \(2^3 \equiv 1 \mod 7\)
  - \(2^4 \equiv 2 \mod 7\)
  - \(2^5 \equiv 4 \mod 7\)
  - \(2^6 \equiv 1 \mod 7\)
  Thus, the sum \(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + \dots + 2^{100}\) modulo 7 can be simplified by considering the cycle of powers of 2 modulo 7.
  The sum of the first 100 powers of 2 modulo 7 can be grouped into sums of cycles:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{100} 2^k \equiv \sum_{k=0}^{100} (2^k \mod 7) \mod 7
  \]
  Since each cycle \(2^1 + 2^2 + 2^3 \equiv 2 + 4 + 1 \equiv 7 \equiv 0 \mod 7\), we only need to consider the last term of the cycle, which is \(2^3 \equiv 1 \mod 7\).
  Therefore, the sum of the first 100 powers of 2 modulo 7 is:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{100} 2^k \equiv 1 \mod 7
  \]
  Thus, the remainder when \(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + \dots + 2^{100}\) is divided by 7 is 3.

  -- Each cycle of powers of 2 modulo 7 sums to 0, and the last term of the cycle is 1.
  -- Therefore, the sum modulo 7 is 1, which is not equal to 3.
