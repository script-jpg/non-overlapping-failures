  To find the remainder when \(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + \dots + 2^{100}\) is divided by 7, we first recognize that this is a geometric series with the first term \(a = 1\) and common ratio \(r = 2\). The sum of the first \(n\) terms of a geometric series is given by \(S_n = a \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1}\). For \(n = 101\), the sum is \(S_{101} = 1 \cdot \frac{2^{101} - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^{101} - 1\). We then compute \(2^{101} \mod 7\) to find the remainder.

  -- Compute the sum of the geometric series 1 + 2 + 2^2 +... + 2^100
  -- The sum of the first 101 terms of the geometric series with first term 1 and common ratio 2 is 2^101 - 1
  -- We need to find the remainder of 2^101 - 1 when divided by 7
