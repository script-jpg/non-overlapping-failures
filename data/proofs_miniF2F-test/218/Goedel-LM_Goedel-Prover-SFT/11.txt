  To find the remainder when \(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + \dots + 2^{100}\) is divided by 7, we start by recognizing that this is a geometric series with the first term \(a = 1\) and common ratio \(r = 2\). The sum of the first \(n\) terms of a geometric series is given by:
  \[
  S_n = a \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1}
  \]
  For \(a = 1\), \(r = 2\), and \(n = 101\), we have:
  \[
  S_{101} = \frac{2^{101} - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^{101} - 1
  \]
  Next, we need to find the remainder of \(2^{101} - 1\) when divided by 7. We can use properties of modular arithmetic to simplify this calculation.

  -- Recognize that the sum is a geometric series with first term 1 and common ratio 2.
  -- The sum of the first 101 terms of such a series can be calculated using the formula for the sum of a geometric series.
  -- The sum of the series 1 + 2 + 2^2 +... + 2^100 is given by (2^101 - 1) / (2 - 1) = 2^101 - 1.
  -- We need to find the remainder of 2^101 - 1 when divided by 7.
