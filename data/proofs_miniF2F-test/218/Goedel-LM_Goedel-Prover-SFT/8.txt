  To find the remainder when \(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + \dots + 2^{100}\) is divided by 7, we start by recognizing that this is a geometric series with the first term \(a = 1\) and common ratio \(r = 2\). The sum of the first \(n\) terms of a geometric series is given by the formula:
  \[
  S_n = a \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1}
  \]
  For our series, \(a = 1\), \(r = 2\), and \(n = 101\). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:
  \[
  S_{101} = 1 \frac{2^{101} - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^{101} - 1
  \]
  Next, we need to find the remainder of \(2^{101} - 1\) when divided by 7. We can simplify this by observing the powers of 2 modulo 7:
  \[
  2^1 \equiv 2 \pmod{7}, \quad 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}, \quad 2^3 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
  \]
  Since \(2^3 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}\), we can use this to simplify \(2^{101}\):
  \[
  2^{101} = 2^{3 \cdot 33 + 2} = (2^3)^{33} \cdot 2^2 \equiv 1^{33} \cdot 4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
  \]
  Thus, \(2^{101} \equiv 4 \pmod{7}\). Therefore:
  \[
  2^{101} - 1 \equiv 4 - 1 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}
  \]
  Hence, the remainder when \(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + \dots + 2^{100}\) is divided by 7 is 3.
