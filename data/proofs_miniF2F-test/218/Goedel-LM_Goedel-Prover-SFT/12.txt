  To find the remainder when the sum \(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + \dots + 2^{100}\) is divided by 7, we first recognize that this is a geometric series with the first term \(a = 1\) and common ratio \(r = 2\). The sum of the first \(n\) terms of a geometric series is given by:
  \[ S_n = \frac{a(r^n - 1)}{r - 1} \]
  For \(n = 101\):
  \[ S_{101} = \frac{1(2^{101} - 1)}{2 - 1} = 2^{101} - 1 \]
  Next, we need to find the remainder of \(2^{101} - 1\) when divided by 7. We can simplify this by noting that:
  \[ 2^3 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
  Thus, we can reduce the exponent modulo 3:
  \[ 101 \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \]
  So,
  \[ 2^{101} \equiv 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]
  Therefore:
  \[ 2^{101} - 1 \equiv 4 - 1 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \]
  Hence, the remainder when \(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + \dots + 2^{100}\) is divided by 7 is 3.
