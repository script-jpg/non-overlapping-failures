  To find the remainder when \(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + \dots + 2^{100}\) is divided by 7, we start by recognizing that this is a geometric series with the first term \(a = 1\) and common ratio \(r = 2\). The sum of the first \(n\) terms of a geometric series is given by the formula:
  \[ S_n = a \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1} \]
  For our series, \(a = 1\), \(r = 2\), and \(n = 101\):
  \[ S_{101} = 1 \frac{2^{101} - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^{101} - 1 \]
  Next, we need to find the remainder of \(2^{101} - 1\) when divided by 7. We can use modular arithmetic to simplify this calculation:
  \[ 2^3 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
  Since \(2^3 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}\), we can express \(2^{101}\) as:
  \[ 2^{101} = 2^{3 \cdot 33 + 2} = (2^3)^{33} \cdot 2^2 \equiv 1^{33} \cdot 2^2 \equiv 2^2 \pmod{7} \]
  Calculating \(2^2\):
  \[ 2^2 = 4 \]
  Thus:
  \[ 2^{101} \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]
  Therefore:
  \[ 2^{101} - 1 \equiv 4 - 1 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \]
  Hence, the remainder when \(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + \dots + 2^{100}\) is divided by 7 is 3.

  -- Recognize that the sum is a geometric series with first term 1 and common ratio 2.
  -- The sum of the first 101 terms is given by (2^101 - 1) / 1.
  -- Use modular arithmetic to find the remainder when (2^101 - 1) is divided by 7.
