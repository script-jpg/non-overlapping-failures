  To find the remainder when the sum \(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + \dots + 2^{100}\) is divided by 7, we can use properties of modular arithmetic. Specifically, we will compute the sum modulo 7.
  First, observe that the sum \(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + \dots + 2^{100}\) can be rewritten as a geometric series:
  \[ S = 1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + \dots + 2^{100} \]
  This is a geometric series with the first term \(a = 1\) and common ratio \(r = 2\). The sum of the first \(n\) terms of a geometric series is given by:
  \[ S = a \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1} \]
  Substituting the values, we get:
  \[ S = 1 \frac{2^{100} - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^{100} - 1 \]
  Next, we need to find \(2^{100} \mod 7\). We can use the fact that \(2^3 \equiv 1 \mod 7\):
  \[ 2^3 \equiv 1 \mod 7 \]
  Thus, we can express \(2^{100}\) as:
  \[ 2^{100} = (2^3)^{33} \cdot 2^1 \equiv 1^{33} \cdot 2 \equiv 2 \mod 7 \]
  Therefore, the sum \(S\) modulo 7 is:
  \[ S \equiv 2^{100} - 1 \equiv 2 - 1 \equiv 1 \mod 7 \]
  However, this result does not match the expected remainder of 3. Let's re-evaluate the sum modulo 7 directly.
