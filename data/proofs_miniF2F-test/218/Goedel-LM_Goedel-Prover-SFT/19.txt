  To find the remainder when \(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + \dots + 2^{100}\) is divided by 7, we start by expressing the sum of the geometric series. The sum of the first \(n\) terms of a geometric series \(a + ar + ar^2 + \ldots + ar^{n-1}\) is given by \(a \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1}\). Here, \(a = 1\), \(r = 2\), and \(n = 101\). Thus, the sum is \(\frac{2^{101} - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^{101} - 1\).
  Next, we need to find the remainder of \(2^{101} - 1\) when divided by 7. We can simplify this by noting that \(2^3 = 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}\). Therefore, \(2^{101} = (2^3)^{33} \cdot 2^2 \equiv 1^{33} \cdot 2^2 \equiv 2^2 \pmod{7}\).
  Thus, \(2^{101} - 1 \equiv 2^2 - 1 \equiv 4 - 1 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}\).

  -- The sum of the series is 2^101 - 1.
  -- We need to find the remainder of 2^101 - 1 when divided by 7.
  -- Since 2^3 ≡ 1 (mod 7), we can simplify 2^101 modulo 7.
  -- 2^101 = (2^3)^33 * 2^2 ≡ 1^33 * 2^2 ≡ 2^2 (mod 7).
  -- Thus, 2^101 - 1 ≡ 2^2 - 1 ≡ 4 - 1 ≡ 3 (mod 7).
