  To find the remainder when \(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + \dots + 2^{100}\) is divided by 7, we start by recognizing that this is a geometric series. The sum of the first \(n\) terms of a geometric series \(a + ar + ar^2 + \ldots + ar^{n-1}\) is given by the formula:
  \[
  S_n = a \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1}
  \]
  In our case, \(a = 1\) and \(r = 2\). Therefore, the sum \(S_{101}\) of the first 101 terms is:
  \[
  S_{101} = 1 \cdot \frac{2^{101} - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^{101} - 1
  \]
  Next, we need to find the remainder when \(2^{101} - 1\) is divided by 7. We can use modular arithmetic to simplify the calculation. We start by noting that:
  \[
  2^3 \equiv 1 \mod 7
  \]
  This is because \(2^3 = 8 \equiv 1 \mod 7\). Therefore, we can express \(2^{101}\) in terms of \(2^3\):
  \[
  2^{101} = 2^{3 \cdot 33 + 2} = (2^3)^{33} \cdot 2^2 \equiv 1^{33} \cdot 4 \equiv 4 \mod 7
  \]
  Thus, we have:
  \[
  2^{101} \equiv 4 \mod 7
  \]
  Now, we need to find:
  \[
  2^{101} - 1 \equiv 4 - 1 \equiv 3 \mod 7
  \]
  Therefore, the remainder when \(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + \dots + 2^{100}\) is divided by 7 is 3.
