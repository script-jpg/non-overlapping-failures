  To find the remainder when \(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + \dots + 2^{100}\) is divided by 7, we start by expressing the sum in a more manageable form. The sum \(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + \dots + 2^{100}\) can be represented as a geometric series:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{100} 2^k
  \]
  This is a geometric series with the first term \(a = 1\) and common ratio \(r = 2\). The sum of the first \(n + 1\) terms of a geometric series is given by:
  \[
  S_{n+1} = \frac{a(r^{n+1} - 1)}{r - 1}
  \]
  For our series, \(a = 1\), \(r = 2\), and \(n = 100\):
  \[
  S_{101} = \frac{1(2^{101} - 1)}{2 - 1} = 2^{101} - 1
  \]
  Next, we need to find the remainder when \(2^{101} - 1\) is divided by 7. We can use modular arithmetic to simplify the calculation. We know that:
  \[
  2^3 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
  \]
  Thus, we can express \(2^{101}\) as:
  \[
  2^{101} = 2^{3 \cdot 33 + 2} = (2^3)^{33} \cdot 2^2 \equiv 1^{33} \cdot 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
  \]
  Therefore:
  \[
  2^{101} - 1 \equiv 4 - 1 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}
  \]
  Hence, the remainder when \(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + \dots + 2^{100}\) is divided by 7 is 3.

  /- After simplification, the sum is 2^101 - 1.
     We need to find the remainder when 2^101 - 1 is divided by 7.
     We know that 2^3 ≡ 1 (mod 7), so we can reduce the exponent modulo 3.
     Since 101 ≡ 2 (mod 3), we have 2^101 ≡ 2^2 ≡ 4 (mod 7).
     Therefore, 2^101 - 1 ≡ 4 - 1 ≡ 3 (mod 7).
