  To find the remainder when \(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + \dots + 2^{100}\) is divided by 7, we start by recognizing that the series is a geometric series. The sum of the first \(n\) terms of a geometric series \(a + ar + ar^2 + \ldots + ar^{n-1}\) is given by \(a \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1}\). In this case, \(a = 1\), \(r = 2\), and \(n = 101\).
  First, we calculate the sum of the series:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{100} 2^k = 1 \cdot \frac{2^{101} - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^{101} - 1
  \]
  Next, we need to find the remainder of \(2^{101} - 1\) when divided by 7. We can simplify this by noting that \(2^3 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}\). Therefore, we can reduce the exponent modulo 3:
  \[
  101 \equiv 2 \pmod{3}
  \]
  Thus,
  \[
  2^{101} \equiv 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
  \]
  Hence,
  \[
  2^{101} - 1 \equiv 4 - 1 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}
  \]
  Therefore, the remainder when \(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + \dots + 2^{100}\) is divided by 7 is 3.

  -- The sum of the series is 2^101 - 1.
  -- We need to find the remainder of 2^101 - 1 when divided by 7.
  -- Notice that 2^3 ≡ 1 (mod 7), so we can reduce the exponent modulo 3.
  -- 101 ≡ 2 (mod 3), so 2^101 ≡ 2^2 ≡ 4 (mod 7).
  -- Therefore, 2^101 - 1 ≡ 4 - 1 ≡ 3 (mod 7).
