  To find the remainder when \(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + \dots + 2^{100}\) is divided by 7, we first recognize that this is a geometric series with the first term \(a = 1\) and common ratio \(r = 2\). The sum of the first \(n\) terms of a geometric series is given by the formula:
  \[
  S_n = a \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1}
  \]
  For our series, \(a = 1\), \(r = 2\), and \(n = 101\):
  \[
  S_{101} = 1 \frac{2^{101} - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^{101} - 1
  \]
  Next, we need to find the remainder of \(2^{101} - 1\) when divided by 7. We can simplify this by noting that:
  \[
  2^3 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
  \]
  Thus, we can reduce the exponent modulo 3:
  \[
  101 \equiv 2 \pmod{3}
  \]
  Therefore, we have:
  \[
  2^{101} \equiv 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
  \]
  Hence, the remainder when \(2^{101} - 1\) is divided by 7 is:
  \[
  4 - 1 = 3
  \]
