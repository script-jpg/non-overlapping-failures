  To find the remainder when \(1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + \dots + 2^{100}\) is divided by 7, we first recognize that this is a geometric series. The sum of the first \(n\) terms of a geometric series \(a + ar + ar^2 + a r^3 + \ldots\) is given by \(\frac{a(r^n - 1)}{r - 1}\), where \(a\) is the first term and \(r\) is the common ratio. Here, \(a = 1\) and \(r = 2\), so the sum of the first 100 terms is \(\frac{1(2^{100} - 1)}{2 - 1} = 2^{100} - 1\).
  Next, we need to find the remainder of \(2^{100} - 1\) when divided by 7. We observe that \(2^3 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}\). Therefore, \(2^{100} = (2^3)^{33} \cdot 2 \equiv 1^{33} \cdot 2 \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\). Thus, the remainder of \(2^{100} - 1\) when divided by 7 is \(2 - 1 = 1\).
  However, this result does not match the expected remainder of 3. Let's re-evaluate the geometric series sum formula and the given solution. The correct sum of the series should be \(\frac{2^{101} - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^{101} - 1\). When we compute \(2^{101} \pmod{7}\), we find that \(2^{101} \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), leading to \(2^{101} - 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}\). This discrepancy suggests a need for further verification or correction.
