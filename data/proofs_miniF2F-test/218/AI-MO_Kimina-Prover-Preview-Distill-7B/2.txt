-- We have $\sum_{k=0}^{100} 2^k = 2^{101} - 1$. This is a geometric series with first term $a = 1$ and common ratio $r = 2$. The sum of the first $n+1$ terms of a geometric series is given by $\frac{r^{n+1} - a}{r - 1}$. In this case, $a = 1$, $r = 2$, and $n = 100$, so we have $\frac{2^{101} - 1}{2 - 1} = 2^{101} - 1$.
