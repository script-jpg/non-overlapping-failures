-- We start by importing the necessary libraries and setting up the theorem statement. We need to find the remainder of the sum $1 + 2 + 2^2 + \dots + 2^{100}$ when divided by 7 and show that it equals 3.

  -- The theorem statement is defined as computing the sum of powers of 2 from $2^0$ to $2^{100}$, which is represented in Lean as:
  -- `∑ k in Finset.range 101, 2 ^ k`

  -- We'll approach this by analyzing the pattern of remainders when powers of 2 are divided by 7.
  -- Let's calculate a few:
  -- $2^0 = 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}$
  -- $2^1 = 2 \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$
  -- $2^2 = 4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}$
  -- $2^3 = 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}$
  -- $2^4 = 16 \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$
  -- $2^5 = 32 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}$
  -- $2^6 = 64 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}$

  -- We observe a repeating pattern every 3 terms: $1, 2, 4, 1, 2, 4, 1, \dots$

  -- This means that for every complete group of 3 consecutive terms in our sum, the sum of remainders is $1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$

  -- Our sum goes from $2^0$ to $2^{100}$, which is a total of 101 terms:
  -- $101 = 3 \cdot 33 + 2$

  -- So we have 33 complete groups of 3 terms, and 2 remaining terms: $2^{99}$ and $2^{100}$
  -- The sum of the remainders of these last 2 terms is $1 + 2 = 3$

  -- Thus the remainder when our sum is divided by 7 is 3.

The Lean 4 proof is remarkably concise because Lean's computational engine can directly evaluate this arithmetic expression. The `native_decide` tactic is powerful enough to compute the sum of powers of 2 up to $2^{100}$ and then compute its remainder modulo 7, confirming our result of 3.

This demonstrates Lean's capability to handle computational arithmetic problems directly, without requiring an explicit proof of the pattern-based reasoning we outlined above. The Lean proof is more direct because it is computing the actual value rather than proving the pattern-based result. However, the mathematical reasoning about the repeating pattern of remainders modulo 7 is still valuable for understanding the problem.
