    -- The sum is $2^{101} - 1$
    -- We need to show that $(2^{101} - 1) % 7 = 3$
    -- Notice that $2^3 = 8 = 7 + 1$, so $2^3 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}$
    -- Thus, $2^{101} = 2^{3 \cdot 33 + 2} = (2^3)^{33} \cdot 2^2 \equiv 1^{33} \cdot 4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}$
    -- So $2^{101} - 1 \equiv 4 - 1 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}$
