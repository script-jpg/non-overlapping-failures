-- We start by importing the necessary libraries and setting up the theorem statement. We need Mathlib for the mathematical tools and Aesop for the automated reasoning. The `maxHeartbeats 0` option removes the limit on the number of steps Aesop can take to solve the problem.

  -- Now we have imported the necessary libraries, set the heartbeats to unlimited, and opened the relevant namespaces. We are ready to state the theorem.
