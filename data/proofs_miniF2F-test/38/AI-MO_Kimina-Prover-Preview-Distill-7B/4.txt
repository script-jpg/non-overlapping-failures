  We can also solve this problem using the `native_decide` tactic, which is powerful enough to evaluate arithmetic expressions directly.
  We first rewrite the sum using the `Finset.sum_Icc_succ_top` lemma, which allows us to break down the sum into more manageable parts.
  Then we compute each part using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence: $S = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)$, where $n$ is the number of terms, $a_1$ is the first term, and $a_n$ is the last term.
  For the first sum from 2010 to 3009:
  - $n = 3009 - 2010 + 1 = 1000$
  - $a_1 = 2010$
  - $a_n = 3009$
  - $S_1 = \frac{1000}{2} \cdot (2010 + 3009) = 500 \cdot 5019 = 2509995$
  For the second sum from 3010 to 4009:
  - $n = 4009 - 3010 + 1 = 1000$
  - $a_1 = 3010$
  - $a_n = 4009$
  - $S_2 = \frac{1000}{2} \cdot (3010 + 4009) = 500 \cdot 7019 = 3509995$
  For the third sum from 4010 to 4018:
  - $n = 4018 - 4010 + 1 = 9$
  - $a_1 = 4010$
  - $a_n = 4018$
  - $S_3 = \frac{9}{2} \cdot (4010 + 4018) = \frac{9}{2} \cdot 8028 = 9 \cdot 4014 = 36099$
  Finally, we add up the three sums: $S = S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 2509995 + 3509995 + 36099 = 6056089$
  Now we compute $6056089 \bmod 2009$:
  - Dividing 6056089 by 2009 gives a quotient of 3009 and a remainder of 0, since $6056089 = 2009 \cdot 3009 + 0$.
  Therefore, $6056089 \bmod 2009 = 0$, which is our final answer.
