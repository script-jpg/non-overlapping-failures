  To compute the residue of \( S = 2010 + 2011 + \cdots + 4018 \) modulo 2009, we start by expressing \( S \) as the sum of an arithmetic series. The series starts at 2010 and ends at 4018, with a common difference of 1. The number of terms in the series is calculated as \( 4018 - 2010 + 1 = 2009 \).
  The sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic series is given by:
  \[ S = \frac{n}{2} \times (a + l) \]
  where \( n \) is the number of terms, \( a \) is the first term, and \( l \) is the last term. Here, \( n = 2009 \), \( a = 2010 \), and \( l = 4018 \).
  Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
  \[ S = \frac{2009}{2} \times (2010 + 4018) = \frac{2009}{2} \times 6028 = 2009 \times 3014 \]
  Next, we need to find the residue of \( S \) modulo 2009. Since \( S = 2009 \times 3014 \), we can reduce the expression modulo 2009:
  \[ 2009 \times 3014 \equiv 0 \times 3014 \equiv 0 \pmod{2009} \]
  Thus, the residue of \( S \) modulo 2009 is 0.
