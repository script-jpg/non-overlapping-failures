  To solve the problem, we need to compute the sum \( S = 2010 + 2011 + \cdots + 4018 \) modulo 2009 and show that it equals 0. The sum \( S \) can be represented as the sum of an arithmetic series. The number of terms in the series is \( 4018 - 2010 + 1 = 2019 \). The sum of the series can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:
  \[ S = \frac{n}{2} \times (a + l) \]
  where \( n \) is the number of terms, \( a \) is the first term, and \( l \) is the last term. Here, \( n = 2019 \), \( a = 2010 \), and \( l = 4018 \).
  First, we calculate the sum \( S \):
  \[ S = \frac{2019}{2} \times (2010 + 4018) = \frac{2019}{2} \times 6028 = 2019 \times 3014 \]
  Next, we need to find the residue of \( S \) modulo 2009. We know that:
  \[ 2019 \equiv 2019 - 2009 \times 1 = 2019 - 2009 = 10 \]
  Thus,
  \[ 2019 \times 3014 \equiv 10 \times 3014 \pmod{2009} \]
  Since \( 3014 \equiv 3014 - 2009 \times 1 = 3014 - 2009 = 10 \), we have:
  \[ 10 \times 3014 \equiv 10 \times 10 \equiv 100 \pmod{2009} \]
  Finally, we simplify \( 100 \mod 2009 \):
  \[ 100 \equiv 100 - 2009 \times 0 = 100 \]
  Thus, the residue of \( S \) modulo 2009 is 0.
