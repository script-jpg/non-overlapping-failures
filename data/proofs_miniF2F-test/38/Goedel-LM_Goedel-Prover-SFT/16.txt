  Given \( S = 2010 + 2011 + \cdots + 4018 \), we need to compute the residue of \( S \) modulo 2009 and show that it is 0.
  First, observe that the sum \( S \) can be expressed as:
  \[ S = \sum_{k=2010}^{4018} k \]
  We can rewrite this sum as:
  \[ S = \sum_{k=0}^{2009} (k + 2010) \]
  This is equivalent to:
  \[ S = \sum_{k=0}^{2009} k + \sum_{k=0}^{2009} 2010 \]
  Since the second sum is simply \( 2010 \times 2010 \), we have:
  \[ S = \sum_{k=0}^{2009} k + 2010 \times 2010 \]
  The first sum is the sum of the first 2009 natural numbers, which is known to be:
  \[ \sum_{k=0}^{2009} k = \frac{2009 \times 2010}{2} \]
  Thus:
  \[ S = \frac{2009 \times 2010}{2} + 2010 \times 2010 \]
  We can factor out \( 2010 \) from the second term:
  \[ S = 2010 \left( \frac{2009}{2} + 2010 \right) \]
  Simplifying inside the parentheses:
  \[ \frac{2009}{2} + 2010 = \frac{2009 + 4020}{2} = \frac{6029}{2} = 3014.5 \]
  Since \( S \) must be an integer, we need to check if \( 3014.5 \) is an integer. This is not possible, so we need to re-evaluate our approach.
  Instead, we can directly compute the sum modulo 2009. Notice that:
  \[ S = \sum_{k=0}^{2009} k + 2010 \times 2010 \]
  Since \( 2010 \equiv 0 \pmod{2009} \), we have:
  \[ 2010 \times 2010 \equiv 0 \pmod{2009} \]
  Thus:
  \[ S \equiv \sum_{k=0}^{2009} k \pmod{2009} \]
  The sum \( \sum_{k=0}^{2009} k \) is the sum of the first 2009 natural numbers, which is:
  \[ \sum_{k=0}^{2009} k = \frac{2009 \times 2010}{2} \]
  Since \( \frac{2009 \times 2010}{2} \equiv 0 \pmod{2009} \), we have:
  \[ S \equiv 0 \pmod{2009} \]
