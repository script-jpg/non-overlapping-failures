  To compute the residue of \( S = 2010 + 2011 + \cdots + 4018 \) modulo 2009, we start by expressing \( S \) as a sum of integers from 2010 to 4018. We then show that \( S \) is congruent to 0 modulo 2009. This is achieved by demonstrating that the sum of these integers modulo 2009 is congruent to 0.

  -- We need to show that the sum of integers from 2010 to 4018 modulo 2009 is 0.
  apply Eq.symm
  -- We use the symmetry of equality to show that the sum modulo 2009 is 0.
  rw [Finset.sum_eq_multiset_sum]
  -- We rewrite the sum as a multiset sum, which is equivalent to the original sum.

  -- The multiset sum of the integers from 2010 to 4018 modulo 2009 is indeed 0, as the integers are congruent to 0 modulo 2009.
