  Given \( S = 2010 + 2011 + \cdots + 4018 \), we need to compute the residue of \( S \) modulo 2009 and show that it is 0.
  First, we express \( S \) as the sum of integers from 2010 to 4018. The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula for the sum of integers from \( a \) to \( b \):
  \[ S = \frac{(b - a + 1)(a + b)}{2} \]
  Here, \( a = 2010 \) and \( b = 4018 \). Substituting these values, we get:
  \[ S = \frac{(4018 - 2010 + 1)(2010 + 4018)}{2} \]
  Simplifying inside the parentheses:
  \[ S = \frac{(2009)(6028)}{2} \]
  Next, we calculate the product:
  \[ S = \frac{2009 \times 6028}{2} \]
  We then find the residue of \( S \) modulo 2009. Since \( 2009 \) is a factor of the numerator but not of the denominator, the residue is simply 0.

  -- The sum of integers from 2010 to 4018 can be calculated as a arithmetic series sum.
  -- The sum of the series is given by the formula for the sum of integers from a to b.
  -- Here, a = 2010, b = 4018.
  -- The sum of the series is (4018 - 2010 + 1)(2010 + 4018) / 2.
  -- Simplifying inside the parentheses, we get (2009)(6028) / 2.
  -- Since 2009 is a factor of the numerator but not of the denominator, the residue is 0.
