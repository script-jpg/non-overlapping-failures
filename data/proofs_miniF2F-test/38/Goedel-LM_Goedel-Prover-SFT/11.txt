  To show that the residue of the sum \( S = 2010 + 2011 + \cdots + 4018 \) modulo 2009 is 0, we start by expressing \( S \) as a sum of a known range of numbers. The sum \( S \) can be written as the sum of integers from 2010 to 4018. We then use the fact that the sum of an arithmetic series can be computed using the formula for the sum of an interval of numbers. Finally, we apply properties of modular arithmetic to show that the sum modulo 2009 is indeed 0.
