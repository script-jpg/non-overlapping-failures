  To show that the residue of \( S = 2010 + 2011 + \cdots + 4018 \) modulo 2009 is 0, we can use the properties of modular arithmetic. Specifically, we will compute the sum of the integers from 2010 to 4018 modulo 2009.
  1. **Sum of the Arithmetic Sequence**: The sum \( S \) can be expressed as the sum of the integers from 2010 to 4018.
  2. **Modular Arithmetic**: We need to find the residue of this sum modulo 2009.
  3. **Simplification**: By properties of modular arithmetic, we can simplify the sum modulo 2009.
  4. **Verification**: Finally, we verify that the residue is indeed 0 modulo 2009.
