  Given \( S = 2010 + 2011 + \cdots + 4018 \), we need to compute the residue of \( S \) modulo 2009 and show that it is 0.
  First, observe that \( S \) can be expressed as the sum of an arithmetic series:
  \[ S = \sum_{k=2010}^{4018} k \]
  This series can be rewritten using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:
  \[ S = \frac{(4018 - 2010 + 1) \cdot (2010 + 4018)}{2} \]
  Simplifying the expression inside the sum:
  \[ S = \frac{2009 \cdot 6028}{2} \]
  Since 2009 is a factor of the numerator, we can simplify the fraction:
  \[ S = 2009 \cdot 3014 \]
  Now, we need to find the residue of \( S \) modulo 2009. Notice that \( 2009 \equiv 0 \mod 2009 \), so:
  \[ S \equiv 2009 \cdot 3014 \mod 2009 \]
  Since \( 2009 \equiv 0 \mod 2009 \), we have:
  \[ S \equiv 0 \mod 2009 \]
  Thus, the residue of \( S \) modulo 2009 is 0.
