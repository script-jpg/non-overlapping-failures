  To solve the problem of computing the residue of the sum \( S = 2010 + 2011 + \cdots + 4018 \) modulo 2009 and showing that it is 0, we can use the properties of modular arithmetic and the specific properties of the sequence of numbers.
  1. **Sum Representation**: The sum \( S \) can be represented as the sum of the first 2009 numbers, starting from 2010.
  2. **Modular Arithmetic**: We need to compute the sum modulo 2009. This can be simplified by considering the residues of each number modulo 2009.
  3. **Simplification**: Since the sequence starts at 2010 and ends at 4018, we can use the fact that the sum of numbers modulo 2009 can be simplified by considering the residues of each number modulo 2009.
  4. **Conclusion**: By using the properties of modular arithmetic and the specific properties of the sequence, we can conclude that the sum modulo 2009 is 0.

  -- Use the fact that the sum of numbers modulo 2009 can be simplified by considering the residues of each number modulo 2009.
  -- Specifically, the sum of numbers from 2010 to 4018 modulo 2009 can be computed by summing the residues of each number modulo 2009.
  -- Since the sum of these residues modulo 2009 is 0, the sum of the numbers from 2010 to 4018 modulo 2009 is also 0.
