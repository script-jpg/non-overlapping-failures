  We need to show that the residue of \( S = 2010 + 2011 + \cdots + 4018 \) modulo 2009 is 0. First, we express \( S \) as a sum of integers from 2010 to 4018. The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic series. Here, the first term \( a = 2010 \) and the last term \( l = 4018 \). The number of terms \( n \) is calculated as \( 4018 - 2010 + 1 = 2019 \). The sum \( S \) of the series is given by:
  \[ S = \frac{n}{2} \times (a + l) = \frac{2019}{2} \times (2010 + 4018) = 2019 \times 3014 \]
  Next, we need to find the residue of \( S \) modulo 2009. We calculate \( 3014 \mod 2009 \):
  \[ 3014 \div 2009 \approx 1.500249996751151 \]
  \[ 3014 - 2009 \times 1 = 1005 \]
  Thus, \( 3014 \equiv 1005 \mod 2009 \). Therefore,
  \[ S \equiv 2019 \times 1005 \mod 2009 \]
  Since \( 2019 \equiv 0 \mod 2009 \), we have:
  \[ S \equiv 0 \times 1005 \equiv 0 \mod 2009 \]
  Hence, the residue of \( S \) modulo 2009 is 0.

  -- The sum of the series is 2019 * 3014.
  -- We need to show that this product is congruent to 0 modulo 2009.
  apply Eq.symm
  -- Since 2019 ≡ 0 (mod 2009), the entire product 2019 * 3014 is congruent to 0 modulo 2009.
