  To solve the problem of computing the residue of the sum \( S = 2010 + 2011 + \cdots + 4018 \) modulo 2009, we start by expressing \( S \) as a sum of integers from 2010 to 4018. We then use the properties of modular arithmetic to show that \( S \equiv 0 \pmod{2009} \).
  1. **Sum Representation**: The sum \( S \) can be written as:
     \[
     S = \sum_{k=2010}^{4018} k
     \]
  2. **Modular Arithmetic**: We need to find \( S \mod 2009 \). We can break down the sum into two parts:
     \[
     S = \sum_{k=2010}^{4018} k = \sum_{k=2010}^{2019} k + \sum_{k=2020}^{4018} k
     \]
  3. **Simplification**:
     - The first part, from 2010 to 2019, is a constant sum:
       \[
       \sum_{k=2010}^{2019} k = 10 \times 2010 = 20100
       \]
     - The second part, from 2020 to 4018, is a sum of integers:
       \[
       \sum_{k=2020}^{4018} k = \sum_{k=2020}^{2029} k + \sum_{k=2030}^{4018} k
       \]
  4. **Final Calculation**:
     - The sum of integers from 2020 to 2029 is:
       \[
       \sum_{k=2020}^{2029} k = 10 \times 2020 = 20200
       \]
     - The sum of integers from 2030 to 4018 is:
       \[
       \sum_{k=2030}^{4018} k = 2009 \times 2010 = 2010 \times 2010 = 4040100
       \]
  5. **Combining Results**:
     - The total sum \( S \) is:
       \[
       S = 20100 + 20200 + 4040100 = 4042210
       \]
     - Taking modulo 2009:
       \[
       4042210 \mod 2009 = 0
       \]
  Thus, the residue of \( S \) modulo 2009 is 0.
