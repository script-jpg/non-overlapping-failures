  To show that the residue of \( S = 2010 + 2011 + \cdots + 4018 \) modulo 2009 is 0, we start by expressing \( S \) as a sum of integers from 2010 to 4018. We then use properties of modular arithmetic to simplify the expression. Specifically, we recognize that the sum of these integers is congruent to 0 modulo 2009, which can be verified by considering the properties of the arithmetic series and the modulus operation.
