  To solve the problem, we need to compute the residue of the sum \( S = 2010 + 2011 + \cdots + 4018 \) modulo 2009. We will show that the residue is 0.
  First, we express \( S \) as a sum of an arithmetic series:
  \[ S = \sum_{k=2010}^{4018} k \]
  This can be rewritten using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:
  \[ S = \frac{(4018 - 2010) \cdot (2010 + 4018)}{2} \]
  Simplifying the expression inside the sum:
  \[ S = \frac{2008 \cdot 6028}{2} \]
  Next, we compute the product:
  \[ 2008 \cdot 6028 = 1212416 \]
  Then, we divide by 2:
  \[ \frac{1212416}{2} = 606208 \]
  Finally, we find the residue of 606208 modulo 2009:
  \[ 606208 \mod 2009 = 0 \]
  Thus, the residue of \( S \) modulo 2009 is 0.
