  To solve the problem, we need to compute the residue of the sum \( S = 2010 + 2011 + \cdots + 4018 \) modulo 2009. We will show that \( S \equiv 0 \pmod{2009} \).
  1. **Sum Representation**: The sum \( S \) can be represented as the sum of an arithmetic series:
     \[
     S = \sum_{k=2010}^{4018} k
     \]
  2. **Modulo Operation**: We need to compute \( S \mod 2009 \).
  3. **Range Analysis**: The range from 2010 to 4018 includes numbers from 2010 to 4018.
  4. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the sum is taken modulo 2009, we can use properties of modular arithmetic to simplify the calculation.
  5. **Simplification**: The sum of the series from 2010 to 4018 can be simplified using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series and then taken modulo 2009.
  6. **Conclusion**: By analyzing the sum and using properties of modular arithmetic, we find that \( S \equiv 0 \pmod{2009} \).
