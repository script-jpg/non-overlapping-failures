  To solve the problem, we need to compute the residue of the sum \( S = 2010 + 2011 + \cdots + 4018 \) modulo 2009. We will show that \( S \equiv 0 \pmod{2009} \).
  1. **Sum Representation**: The sum \( S \) can be represented as the sum of integers from 2010 to 4018.
  2. **Modulo Operation**: We need to compute the sum modulo 2009.
  3. **Range Analysis**: The integers from 2010 to 4018 can be grouped into sets of numbers that are congruent to 0 modulo 2009.
  4. **Simplification**: By analyzing the residues of each number in the range, we can show that the sum of these residues is congruent to 0 modulo 2009.
