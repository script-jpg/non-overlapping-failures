  To compute the residue of \( S \), where \( S = 2010 + 2011 + \cdots + 4018 \) modulo 2009, we can use the properties of modular arithmetic. Specifically, we will show that the sum \( S \) is congruent to 0 modulo 2009.
  First, observe that each number from 2010 to 4018 can be expressed as \( k = 2010 + n \) where \( n \) is a non-negative integer. The sum \( S \) can then be written as:
  \[ S = \sum_{k=2010}^{4018} k = \sum_{n=0}^{2009} (2010 + n) \]
  This sum can be split into two separate sums:
  \[ S = \sum_{n=0}^{2009} 2010 + \sum_{n=0}^{2009} n \]
  The first sum is straightforward:
  \[ \sum_{n=0}^{2009} 2010 = 2010 \times 2010 = 2010^2 \]
  The second sum is the sum of the first 2009 natural numbers:
  \[ \sum_{n=0}^{2009} n = \frac{2009 \times 2010}{2} = 1004 \times 2010 \]
  Combining these two sums, we get:
  \[ S = 2010^2 + 1004 \times 2010 \]
  We can factor out 2010 from the second term:
  \[ S = 2010(2010 + 1004) \]
  Since \( 2010 + 1004 = 3014 \), we have:
  \[ S = 2010 \times 3014 \]
  Now, we need to find the residue of \( S \) modulo 2009. Notice that:
  \[ 2010 \equiv 1 \pmod{2009} \]
  Thus:
  \[ 2010 \times 3014 \equiv 1 \times 3014 \equiv 3014 \pmod{2009} \]
  Since \( 3014 \equiv 0 \pmod{2009} \), we conclude that:
  \[ S \equiv 0 \pmod{2009} \]
