  To solve the problem, we need to compute the residue of the sum \( S = 2010 + 2011 + \cdots + 4018 \) modulo 2009 and show that it is 0. We start by expressing the sum \( S \) using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The sum \( S \) can be written as:
  \[ S = \sum_{k=2010}^{4018} k \]
  This sum can be simplified using the properties of arithmetic series. The first term \( a \) is 2010, the last term \( l \) is 4018, and the number of terms \( n \) is:
  \[ n = 4018 - 2010 + 1 = 2019 \]
  The sum \( S \) of an arithmetic series is given by:
  \[ S = \frac{n}{2} \times (a + l) \]
  Substituting the values, we get:
  \[ S = \frac{2019}{2} \times (2010 + 4018) = \frac{2019}{2} \times 6028 = 2019 \times 3014 \]
  Now, we need to compute the residue of \( S \) modulo 2009. We calculate \( 2019 \times 3014 \mod 2009 \):
  \[ 2019 \equiv 1 \mod 2009 \]
  \[ 3014 \equiv 14 \mod 2009 \]
  Thus,
  \[ 2019 \times 3014 \equiv 1 \times 14 \equiv 14 \mod 2009 \]
  However, this result does not match the expected residue of 0. Let's re-evaluate the steps to ensure correctness.
