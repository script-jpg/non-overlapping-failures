  We need to show that for the function \( f(x) = 4^x + 6^x + 9^x \), if \( m \) and \( n \) are positive integers with \( m \leq n \), then \( f(2^m) \) divides \( f(2^n) \).
  1. Substitute \( x = 2^m \) and \( x = 2^n \) into the function \( f \).
  2. Simplify the expressions \( f(2^m) \) and \( f(2^n) \).
  3. Recognize that \( 2^m \) and \( 2^n \) are powers of 2, and thus the expressions can be factored using properties of powers.
  4. Use the fact that \( 2^m \leq 2^n \) (since \( m \leq n \)) to argue that the terms involving powers of 2 will divide each other.
  5. Combine these observations to conclude that \( f(2^m) \) divides \( f(2^n) \).
