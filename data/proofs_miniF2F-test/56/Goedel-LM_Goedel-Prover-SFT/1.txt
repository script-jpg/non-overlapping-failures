  Given the function \( f(x) = 4^x + 6^x + 9^x \), we need to show that if \( m \) and \( n \) are positive integers with \( m \leq n \), then \( f(2^m) \) divides \( f(2^n) \).
  First, we express \( f(2^m) \) and \( f(2^n) \) using the definition of \( f \):
  \[ f(2^m) = 4^{2^m} + 6^{2^m} + 9^{2^m} \]
  \[ f(2^n) = 4^{2^n} + 6^{2^n} + 9^{2^n} \]
  Next, we need to show that \( f(2^m) \) divides \( f(2^n) \). This can be achieved by demonstrating that \( f(2^n) \) is a multiple of \( f(2^m) \).
