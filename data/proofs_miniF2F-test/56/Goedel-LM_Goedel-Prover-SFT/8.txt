  Given the function \( f(x) = 4^x + 6^x + 9^x \), we need to show that if \( m \) and \( n \) are positive integers with \( m \leq n \), then \( f(2^m) \) divides \( f(2^n) \).
  1. **Simplify the expressions**:
     - For \( m \) and \( n \), we need to show that \( f(2^m) \) divides \( f(2^n) \).
     - This can be rewritten as \( 4^{2^m} + 6^{2^m} + 9^{2^m} \) divides \( 4^{2^n} + 6^{2^n} + 9^{2^n} \).
  2. **Use properties of exponents**:
     - Since \( f \) is a sum of powers of 4, 6, and 9, we can use the fact that \( 4^{2^m} \), \( 6^{2^m} \), and \( 9^{2^m} \) are all powers of 4, 6, and 9 respectively.
     - The sum \( 4^{2^m} + 6^{2^m} + 9^{2^m} \) is a sum of powers of 4, 6, and 9.
  3. **Apply divisibility**:
     - We need to show that \( 4^{2^m} + 6^{2^m} + 9^{2^m} \) divides \( 4^{2^n} + 6^{2^n} + 9^{2^n} \).
     - This can be shown by demonstrating that the sum of the powers of 4, 6, and 9 in the denominator is greater than or equal to the sum in the numerator.
  4. **Use the fact that \( m \leq n \)**:
     - Since \( m \leq n \), the powers of 4, 6, and 9 in the denominator are at least as large as those in the numerator.
     - Therefore, the sum of the powers in the denominator is at least as large as the sum in the numerator, proving the divisibility.
