  Given the function \( f(x) = 4^x + 6^x + 9^x \), we need to show that if \( m \) and \( n \) are positive integers with \( m \leq n \), then \( f(2^m) \) divides \( f(2^n) \).
  1. Substitute \( x = 2^m \) and \( x = 2^n \) into the function \( f \).
  2. Simplify the expressions for \( f(2^m) \) and \( f(2^n) \).
  3. Recognize that the terms \( 6^x \) and \( 9^x \) are powers of 6 and 9, respectively, and thus do not affect the divisibility of \( f(2^m) \) by \( f(2^n) \).
  4. Since \( 6^x \) and \( 9^x \) are not present in the divisibility problem, we only need to consider \( 4^x \).
  5. The term \( 4^x \) is a power of 4, and thus it contributes to the divisibility of \( f(2^m) \) by \( f(2^n) \).
  6. Given the constraints \( m \leq n \), the term \( 4^{2^n} \) is a power of 4 that can be expressed as a multiple of \( 4^{2^m} \), ensuring that \( f(2^m) \) divides \( f(2^n) \).
