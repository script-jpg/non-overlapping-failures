  Given the function \( f(x) = 4^x + 6^x + 9^x \), we need to show that if \( m \) and \( n \) are positive integers with \( m \leq n \), then \( f(2^m) \) divides \( f(2^n) \).
  To prove this, we will use the fact that \( f(2^m) \) and \( f(2^n) \) can be expressed in terms of powers of 2. Specifically, we will show that \( f(2^m) \) divides \( f(2^n) \) by demonstrating that the coefficients of the powers of 2 in the expressions for \( f(2^m) \) and \( f(2^n) \) are such that \( f(2^m) \) is a factor of \( f(2^n) \).
