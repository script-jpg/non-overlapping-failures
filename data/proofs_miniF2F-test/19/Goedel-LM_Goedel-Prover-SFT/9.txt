  To prove that for the given values of \( x \) the inequality \( \frac{4x^2}{(1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2} < 2x + 9 \) holds, we need to establish the bounds for \( x \) that satisfy the inequality. The proof involves simplifying the inequality and using algebraic manipulations to find the range of \( x \) that satisfies the inequality.
  1. **Simplify the inequality**: We start by simplifying the inequality \( \frac{4x^2}{(1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2} < 2x + 9 \).
  2. **Establish bounds**: We need to find the range of \( x \) that satisfies the inequality. By analyzing the terms involved and using basic algebraic inequalities, we can determine the bounds.
