  To determine the values of \( x \) for which the inequality \(\dfrac{4x^2}{(1 - \sqrt {2x + 1})^2} < 2x + 9\) holds, we start by analyzing the given inequality. The key steps involve ensuring that the denominator is non-zero and that the inequality can be simplified algebraically.
  1. **Non-negativity of the square root**: Since \( \sqrt{1 + 2x} \) is a square root of a non-negative number, it is non-negative.
  2. **Simplification and algebraic manipulation**: We simplify the inequality by clearing the denominator and solving the resulting polynomial inequality.
  3. **Verification of the solution**: We verify that the solution \( x \) satisfies the original inequality and the constraints on \( x \).
