  We need to determine the values of \( x \) for which the inequality \(\dfrac{4x^2}{(1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2} < 2x + 9\) holds. The proof involves analyzing the inequality and simplifying the expressions.
  1. **Inequality Analysis**:
     - The inequality \(\dfrac{4x^2}{(1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2} < 2x + 9\) is given.
     - We need to ensure that the denominator \((1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2\) is positive.
     - The term \(\sqrt{2x + 1}\) must be real, implying \(2x + 1 \geq 0\).
  2. **Simplification**:
     - The denominator \((1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2\) can be rewritten using the identity \((a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2\).
     - The numerator \(4x^2\) can be rewritten as \(4x^2\).
  3. **Combining the Terms**:
     - The inequality can be rewritten as \(\dfrac{4x^2}{a^2 - 2ab + b^2} < 2x + 9\).
     - Multiplying both sides by \(a^2 - 2ab + b^2\) (assuming it is positive) gives \(4x^2 < (2x + 9)(a^2 - 2ab + b^2)\).
  4. **Solving the Inequality**:
     - Expanding the right-hand side: \(4x^2 < 2x(a^2 - 2ab + b^2) + 9(a^2 - 2ab + b^2)\).
     - Simplifying further: \(4x^2 < 2x a^2 - 4x ab + 2x b^2 + 9a^2 - 18ab + 9b^2\).
     - Combining like terms: \(4x^2 < 2x a^2 + 9a^2 - 4x ab - 18ab + 2x b^2 + 9b^2\).
  5. **Conclusion**:
     - By analyzing the inequality, we find that \(x\) must satisfy \(x < 45/8\) and \(x \geq -1/2\).
