  To prove that for the given values of \( x \), the inequality \( \frac{4x^2}{(1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2} < 2x + 9 \) holds, we need to show that \( x \) is within the interval \([-1/2, 45/8)\). This involves demonstrating that \( x \) is greater than or equal to \(-1/2\) and less than \( 45/8 \).
  1. **Lower Bound**: We need to show that \( x \geq -1/2 \).
  2. **Upper Bound**: We need to show that \( x < 45/8 \).
  Given the constraints \( 0 \leq 1 + 2x \) and \( (1 - \sqrt{1 + 2x})^2 \neq 0 \), we can use these to establish the bounds.
