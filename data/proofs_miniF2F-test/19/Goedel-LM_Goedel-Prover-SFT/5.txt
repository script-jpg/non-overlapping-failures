  To determine the values of \( x \) for which the inequality \( \frac{4x^2}{(1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2} < 2x + 9 \) holds, we need to ensure that the denominator \( (1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2 \) is non-zero. This implies that \( 1 - \sqrt{2x + 1} \neq 0 \), which simplifies to \( \sqrt{2x + 1} \neq 1 \). This condition further restricts \( x \) to \( 0 \leq 1 + 2x \).
  Given the inequality, we can rewrite it as:
  \[ \frac{4x^2}{(1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2} < 2x + 9 \]
  To solve this, we first clear the denominator by multiplying both sides by \( (1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2 \):
  \[ 4x^2 < (2x + 9)(1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2 \]
  Expanding the right-hand side:
  \[ 4x^2 < 2x + 9 - 2x \sqrt{2x + 1} - 9 \sqrt{2x + 1} + 9 \]
  Simplifying further:
  \[ 4x^2 < 2x + 9 - 2x \sqrt{2x + 1} - 9 \sqrt{2x + 1} + 9 \]
  Combining like terms:
  \[ 4x^2 < 2x + 9 - 2x \sqrt{2x + 1} - 9 \sqrt{2x + 1} + 9 \]
  Given the constraints \( 0 \leq 1 + 2x \) and \( \sqrt{2x + 1} \neq 1 \), we can deduce that \( x \) must satisfy:
  \[ - \frac{1}{2} \leq x < \frac{45}{8} \]
