  We need to determine the values of \( x \) for which the inequality \(\dfrac{4x^2}{(1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2} < 2x + 9\) holds. We are given the conditions \( 0 \leq 1 + 2x \), \( (1 - \sqrt{1 + 2x})^2 \neq 0 \), and \( \frac{4x^2}{(1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2} < 2x + 9 \).
  1. **Non-negativity Condition**: Since \( 0 \leq 1 + 2x \), we can infer that \( 0 \leq 2x + 1 \).
  2. **Non-zero Denominator**: The denominator \( (1 - \sqrt{1 + 2x})^2 \) is non-zero, implying \( 1 - \sqrt{1 + 2x} \neq 0 \).
  3. **Inequality Analysis**: The inequality \( \frac{4x^2}{(1 - \sqrt{1 + 2x})^2} < 2x + 9 \) must be analyzed to find the range of \( x \) that satisfies it.
  4. **Simplification and Solving**: By simplifying the inequality and solving for \( x \), we find that \( x \) must satisfy \( -\frac{1}{2} \leq x < \frac{45}{8} \).
