  To determine the values of \( x \) for which the inequality \(\dfrac{4x^2}{(1 - \sqrt {2x + 1})^2} < 2x + 9\) holds, we need to analyze the given conditions and the inequality itself. The key steps involve ensuring that the denominator is non-zero and then simplifying the inequality.
  1. **Non-zero Denominator Condition**: Given \( (1 - \sqrt {2x + 1})^2 \neq 0 \), we know that \( 1 - \sqrt {2x + 1} \neq 0 \), which implies \( \sqrt {2x + 1} \neq 1 \). Squaring both sides, we get \( 2x + 1 \neq 1 \), which simplifies to \( 2x \neq 0 \) or \( x \neq 0 \).
  2. **Inequality Analysis**: The inequality \(\dfrac{4x^2}{(1 - \sqrt {2x + 1})^2} < 2x + 9\) can be rewritten as \( 4x^2 < (2x + 9)(1 - \sqrt {2x + 1})^2 \). Expanding the right-hand side and simplifying, we get:
     \[
     4x^2 < (2x + 9)(1 - 2\sqrt {2x + 1} + (2x + 1))
     \]
     Simplifying further, we have:
     \[
     4x^2 < 2x + 9 - 4\sqrt {2x + 1} + 2x + 1
     \]
     Combining like terms, we get:
     \[
     4x^2 < 4x + 10 - 4\sqrt {2x + 1}
     \]
     Rearranging terms, we obtain:
     \[
     4x^2 - 4x - 10 < -4\sqrt {2x + 1}
     \]
     Since \( 4x^2 - 4x - 10 \) is a quadratic expression and \( -4\sqrt {2x + 1} \) is a linear term, we can analyze the quadratic expression to find the range of \( x \) that satisfies the inequality.
