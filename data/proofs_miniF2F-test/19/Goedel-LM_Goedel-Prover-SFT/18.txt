  To determine the values of \( x \) that satisfy the inequality \(\dfrac{4x^2}{(1 - \sqrt {2x + 1})^2} < 2x + 9\), we start by analyzing the inequality. We need to ensure that the denominator is positive and the numerator is within the specified range. The denominator is a square of a real number, so it is always non-negative. We then simplify and solve the inequality to find the range of \( x \) that satisfies the given conditions.
