  To solve the inequality \(\dfrac{4x^2}{(1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2} < 2x + 9\), we start by ensuring the non-negativity of the terms involved. Given \(0 \leq 1 + 2x\), we can proceed with the inequality. We need to show that \(x\) lies within the interval \([-1/2, 45/8)\).
  First, we simplify the inequality by eliminating the square root and ensuring the denominator is non-zero. This leads to the inequality \(4x^2 < (2x + 9)(1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2\).
  Next, we expand and simplify the right-hand side of the inequality. This involves algebraic manipulation to compare the left-hand side and the right-hand side.
  Finally, we use numerical and algebraic properties to establish the bounds for \(x\).
