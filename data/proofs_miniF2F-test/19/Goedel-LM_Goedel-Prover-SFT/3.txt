  To determine the values of \( x \) for which the inequality \(\dfrac{4x^2}{(1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2} < 2x + 9\) holds, we need to analyze the conditions under which the inequality is satisfied. The key steps involve ensuring that the denominator is non-zero and the inequality itself.
  1. **Non-zero Denominator**: The denominator \((1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2\) must be non-zero. This implies that \(1 - \sqrt{2x + 1} \neq 0\), which simplifies to \(\sqrt{2x + 1} \neq 1\).
  2. **Inequality Analysis**: The inequality \(\dfrac{4x^2}{(1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2} < 2x + 9\) must be satisfied. This can be rewritten as \(4x^2 < (2x + 9)(1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2\).
  3. **Simplification**: By expanding and simplifying the right-hand side, we can derive the necessary conditions for \( x \).
  4. **Conclusion**: Through algebraic manipulation and the use of non-negative properties of square roots, we conclude that \( x \) must satisfy \(-1/2 \leq x < 45/8\).
