  To determine the values of \( x \) for which the inequality \(\dfrac{4x^2}{(1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2} < 2x + 9\) holds, we start by analyzing the given inequality. We need to ensure that the denominator \((1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2\) is non-zero, which is given by \( h₁ \). We then proceed to prove that \( x \) must satisfy both \( -1/2 \leq x \) and \( x < 45/8 \).

    -- Using the properties of the square root and the given inequalities, we derive that x must be at least -1/2.
