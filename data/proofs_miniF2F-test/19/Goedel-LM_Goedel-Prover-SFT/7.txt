  To determine the values of \( x \) for which the inequality \(\dfrac{4x^2}{(1 - \sqrt {2x + 1})^2} < 2x + 9\) holds, we need to analyze the conditions under which the expression is defined and the inequality is satisfied.
  1. **Non-negativity of the Denominator**: The term \((1 - \sqrt {2x + 1})^2\) must be non-zero. This implies that \(1 - \sqrt {2x + 1} \neq 0\).
  2. **Non-negativity of the Square Root**: The square root \(\sqrt {2x + 1}\) must be non-negative, implying \(2x + 1 \geq 0\).
  3. **Inequality Analysis**: We need to solve the inequality \(\dfrac{4x^2}{(1 - \sqrt {2x + 1})^2} < 2x + 9\). This inequality can be rewritten as:
     \[
     4x^2 < (2x + 9)(1 - \sqrt {2x + 1})^2
     \]
     Expanding the right-hand side and simplifying, we get:
     \[
     4x^2 < 2x + 9 - 2x\sqrt {2x + 1} - 9\sqrt {2x + 1} + (2x + 9)(\sqrt {2x + 1})^2
     \]
     Simplifying further, we have:
     \[
     4x^2 < 2x + 9 - 2x\sqrt {2x + 1} - 9\sqrt {2x + 1} + 2x + 9
     \]
     Combining like terms, we get:
     \[
     4x^2 < 4x + 18 - 2x\sqrt {2x + 1} - 9\sqrt {2x + 1}
     \]
     Rearranging terms, we have:
     \[
     4x^2 - 4x - 18 + 2x\sqrt {2x + 1} + 9\sqrt {2x + 1} < 0
     \]
     This inequality must hold for \(x\) to be in the interval \([-1/2, 45/8)\).
