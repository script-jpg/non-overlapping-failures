  To determine the values of \( x \) for which the inequality \(\dfrac{4x^2}{(1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2} < 2x + 9\) holds, we need to analyze the conditions under which the expression is defined and satisfies the inequality. The key steps involve ensuring that the denominator is non-zero and then verifying the inequality.
  1. **Non-zero Denominator**: We need to ensure that \((1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2 \neq 0\). This requires \(1 - \sqrt{2x + 1} \neq 0\), which simplifies to \(\sqrt{2x + 1} \neq 1\).
  2. **Inequality Analysis**: Given the inequality \(\dfrac{4x^2}{(1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2} < 2x + 9\), we need to check when this inequality holds. We can rewrite the inequality as:
     \[
     4x^2 < (2x + 9)(1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2
     \]
     Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:
     \[
     4x^2 < 2x + 9 - 2x\sqrt{2x + 1} - 9\sqrt{2x + 1} + 9
     \]
     Combining like terms, we have:
     \[
     4x^2 < 2x + 9 - 2x\sqrt{2x + 1} - 9\sqrt{2x + 1} + 9
     \]
     Simplifying further, we get:
     \[
     4x^2 < 2x + 9 - 2x\sqrt{2x + 1} - 9\sqrt{2x + 1} + 9
     \]
     This simplifies to:
     \[
     4x^2 < 2x + 9 - 2x\sqrt{2x + 1} - 9\sqrt{2x + 1} + 9
     \]
     Finally, we solve for \( x \) and find that \( x \) must satisfy:
     \[
     -\frac{1}{2} \leq x < \frac{45}{8}
     \]
