  To determine the values of \( x \) that satisfy the inequality \(\dfrac{4x^2}{(1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2} < 2x + 9\), we start by analyzing the given conditions and the inequality itself. We know that the denominator \((1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2\) is non-zero, which implies that the square root term is non-negative. We then proceed to simplify and solve the inequality using algebraic manipulations and properties of real numbers.

  -- We need to prove two parts: -(1/2) ≤ x and x < 45/8.

  -- Part 1: Prove -(1/2) ≤ x.
  -- We use the fact that the square root of a non-negative number is non-negative.
  -- We also use the inequality and the non-negativity properties to derive the lower bound.

  -- Part 2: Prove x < 45/8.
  -- We use the fact that the square root of a non-negative number is non-negative.
  -- We also use the inequality and the non-negativity properties to derive the upper bound.
