  To determine the values of \( x \) for which the inequality \(\dfrac{4x^2}{(1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2} < 2x + 9\) holds, we start by analyzing the given conditions and the inequality itself. The key steps involve ensuring that the denominator is non-zero and then simplifying the inequality using algebraic manipulations and numerical bounds.
  1. **Non-zero Denominator Condition**: The condition \( (1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2 \neq 0 \) ensures that the denominator is non-zero. This implies that the expression inside the square root, \( 2x + 1 \), must be non-negative.
  2. **Non-negativity Condition**: From \( 0 \leq 2x + 1 \), we derive that \( 2x + 1 \geq 0 \).
  3. **Inequality Analysis**: The inequality \(\dfrac{4x^2}{(1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2} < 2x + 9\) can be rewritten by multiplying both sides by \((1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2\) to clear the fraction. This results in a quadratic inequality in \( x \).
  4. **Numerical Bound**: Using numerical methods or known inequalities, we find that the solution to the inequality is \( x \) must satisfy \( -\frac{1}{2} \leq x < \frac{45}{8} \).
