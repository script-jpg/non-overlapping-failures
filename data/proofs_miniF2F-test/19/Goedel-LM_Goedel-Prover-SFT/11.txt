  To determine the values of \( x \) for which the inequality \(\dfrac{4x^2}{(1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2} < 2x + 9\) holds, we start by analyzing the given inequality. We need to ensure that the denominator \((1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2\) is not zero, which is given by \( h₁ \). We then proceed to simplify the inequality using algebraic manipulations and numerical bounds.
  1. **Non-negativity of the square root**: We use the fact that the square root of a non-negative number is non-negative.
  2. **Simplification and numerical bounds**: We simplify the inequality using numerical methods and algebraic manipulations to find the range of \( x \) that satisfies the inequality.
