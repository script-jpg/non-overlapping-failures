  We need to determine the values of \( x \) that satisfy the inequality \(\dfrac{4x^2}{(1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2} < 2x + 9\). The proof involves simplifying the inequality and solving for \( x \).
  1. **Normalize the inequality**: We start by simplifying the given inequality using algebraic manipulations.
  2. **Establish bounds**: We use the properties of the square root and algebraic manipulations to derive the bounds for \( x \).
  3. **Verify the bounds**: We verify that the derived bounds satisfy the original inequality.
