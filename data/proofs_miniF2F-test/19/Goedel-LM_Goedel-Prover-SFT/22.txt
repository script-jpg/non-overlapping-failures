  To prove the inequality \(\dfrac{4x^2}{(1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2} < 2x + 9\) for \(x\) values that satisfy \(0 \leq 1 + 2x\), we need to show that \(x\) must lie within the interval \([-1/2, 45/8)\). This involves demonstrating that \(x\) is greater than or equal to \(-1/2\) and strictly less than \(45/8\).

  -- We need to prove two parts: -(1 / 2) ≤ x and x < 45 / 8.

  -- First, prove -(1 / 2) ≤ x.
  -- Use the fact that the square root of a non-negative number is non-negative.
  -- Apply the inequality derived from the given inequality using numerical simplification.

    -- If x < -(1 / 2), then the inequality 4x^2 / (1 - sqrt(2x + 1))^2 < 2x + 9 is violated.
    -- This is because the left-hand side becomes non-negative due to the numerator being non-negative and the denominator being non-negative.
    -- This leads to a contradiction with the given inequality.

  -- Second, prove x < 45 / 8.
