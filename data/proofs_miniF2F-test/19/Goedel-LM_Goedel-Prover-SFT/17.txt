  To determine the values of \( x \) for which the inequality \(\dfrac{4x^2}{(1 - \sqrt {2x + 1})^2} < 2x + 9\) holds, we start by analyzing the given inequality. We need to ensure that the denominator \((1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2\) is non-zero, which is given by \( h_1 \). We then proceed to simplify and solve the inequality.
  First, we simplify the inequality:
  \[
  \dfrac{4x^2}{(1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2} < 2x + 9
  \]
  Multiplying both sides by \((1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2\) (since it is positive) gives:
  \[
  4x^2 < (2x + 9)(1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2
  \]
  Expanding the right-hand side:
  \[
  4x^2 < 2x^2 + 18x + 9 - 2x \sqrt{2x + 1} - 9 \sqrt{2x + 1}
  \]
  Simplifying further:
  \[
  4x^2 < 2x^2 + 18x + 9 - 2x \sqrt{2x + 1} - 9 \sqrt{2x + 1}
  \]
  Rearranging terms:
  \[
  4x^2 - 2x^2 - 18x - 9 + 2x \sqrt{2x + 1} + 9 \sqrt{2x + 1} < 0
  \]
  \[
  2x^2 - 18x + 9 + 2x \sqrt{2x + 1} + 9 \sqrt{2x + 1} < 0
  \]
  This inequality can be solved by considering the discriminant of the quadratic equation and the properties of the square root function. The solution involves ensuring that the expression inside the square root is non-negative and solving for \( x \).
