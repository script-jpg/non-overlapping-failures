  We need to determine the values of \( x \) for which the inequality \( \frac{4x^2}{(1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2} < 2x + 9 \) holds. The given proof is structured to show that \( x \) must satisfy \( -\frac{1}{2} \leq x < \frac{45}{8} \).
  1. **Non-negativity of the square root**: We start by noting that the square root of a non-negative number is non-negative.
  2. **Non-negativity of the expression**: We need to ensure that the expression inside the square root, \( 1 + 2x \), is non-negative.
  3. **Inequality analysis**: Given the inequality \( \frac{4x^2}{(1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2} < 2x + 9 \), we need to analyze the behavior of the function and the constraints on \( x \).
  4. **Simplification and algebraic manipulation**: We simplify the inequality and use algebraic manipulation to find the range of \( x \) that satisfies the inequality.
  5. **Conclusion**: By analyzing the inequality and the constraints, we conclude that \( x \) must be in the interval \( \left[-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{45}{8}\right) \).
