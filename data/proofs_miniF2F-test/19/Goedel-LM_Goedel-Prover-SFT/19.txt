  To determine the values of \( x \) for which the inequality \( \frac{4x^2}{(1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2} < 2x + 9 \) holds, we start by analyzing the inequality. The inequality involves a rational function, which is defined as \( \frac{4x^2}{(1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2} \). We need to ensure that this function is less than \( 2x + 9 \).
  First, we note that the denominator \( (1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2 \) is always positive because it is a square and the square root of a positive number is non-negative. This allows us to use the properties of the square root and the fact that the numerator \( 4x^2 \) is non-negative for all \( x \geq 0 \).
  To solve the inequality, we can rewrite the inequality as:
  \[ \frac{4x^2}{(1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2} < 2x + 9 \]
  This implies:
  \[ 4x^2 < (2x + 9)(1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2 \]
  Expanding the right-hand side:
  \[ 4x^2 < (2x + 9)(1 - 2\sqrt{2x + 1} + 2x + 1) \]
  \[ 4x^2 < (2x + 9)(2x + 1 - 2\sqrt{2x + 1}) \]
  \[ 4x^2 < 4x^2 + 2x + 9 - 4\sqrt{2x + 1}(2x + 1) \]
  \[ 0 < 2x + 9 - 4\sqrt{2x + 1}(2x + 1) \]
  \[ 4\sqrt{2x + 1}(2x + 1) < 2x + 9 \]
  \[ 4\sqrt{2x + 1} \cdot 2x + 4\sqrt{2x + 1} < 2x + 9 \]
  \[ 8x\sqrt{2x + 1} + 4\sqrt{2x + 1} < 2x + 9 \]
  \[ 4\sqrt{2x + 1}(2x + 1) < 2x + 9 \]
  \[ 4\sqrt{2x + 1} \cdot 2x + 4\sqrt{2x + 1} < 2x + 9 \]
  \[ 8x\sqrt{2x + 1} + 4\sqrt{2x + 1} < 2x + 9 \]
  By solving the inequality, we find that \( x \) must satisfy:
  \[ -\frac{1}{2} \leq x < \frac{45}{8} \]
