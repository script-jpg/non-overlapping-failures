  To determine the values of \( x \) for which the inequality \(\dfrac{4x^2}{(1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2} < 2x + 9\) holds, we need to analyze the conditions under which the expression is defined and the inequality holds.
  1. **Non-negativity of the square root**: We start by noting that the square root \(\sqrt{2x + 1}\) is non-negative because \(2x + 1 \geq 0\).
  2. **Non-zero denominator**: The denominator \((1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2\) must be non-zero. This implies that \(1 - \sqrt{2x + 1} \neq 0\), which simplifies to \(\sqrt{2x + 1} \neq 1\).
  3. **Inequality analysis**: The inequality \(\dfrac{4x^2}{(1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2} < 2x + 9\) can be rewritten as \(4x^2 < (2x + 9)(1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2\).
  Given these conditions, we can derive the bounds for \( x \) by solving the inequality and ensuring that the denominator is non-zero.
