  To determine the values of \( x \) that satisfy the inequality \( \frac{4x^2}{(1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2} < 2x + 9 \), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Establish non-negativity and non-zero conditions**:
     - \( 0 \leq 1 + 2x \)
     - \( (1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2 \neq 0 \)
  2. **Simplify the inequality**:
     - The inequality \( \frac{4x^2}{(1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2} < 2x + 9 \) is given.
  3. **Analyze the inequality**:
     - We need to show that \( - \frac{1}{2} \leq x < \frac{45}{8} \).
  4. **Use algebraic manipulation and numerical bounds**:
     - By simplifying and solving the inequality, we can derive the bounds \( - \frac{1}{2} \leq x < \frac{45}{8} \).
