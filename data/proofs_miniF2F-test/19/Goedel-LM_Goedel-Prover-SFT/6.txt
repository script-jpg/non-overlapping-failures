  To determine the values of \( x \) for which the inequality \(\dfrac{4x^2}{(1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2} < 2x + 9\) holds, we need to analyze the conditions under which the expression is defined and the inequality holds.
  1. **Non-negativity of the square root**: The square root \(\sqrt{2x + 1}\) is non-negative when \(2x + 1 \geq 0\), which simplifies to \(x \geq -\frac{1}{2}\).
  2. **Non-zero condition**: The denominator \((1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2\) is non-zero when \(1 - \sqrt{2x + 1} \neq 0\), which implies \(1 \neq \sqrt{2x + 1}\). This condition is satisfied when \(2x + 1 \neq 1\), which simplifies to \(x \neq 0\).
  3. **Inequality analysis**: The inequality \(\dfrac{4x^2}{(1 - \sqrt{2x + 1})^2} < 2x + 9\) must be analyzed under the constraints derived from the non-negativity and non-zero conditions.
  By analyzing the conditions and the inequality, we find that the solution to the inequality is \(x \in \left[-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{45}{8}\right)\).
