  Given odd integers \(a, b, c, d\) such that \(0 < a < b < c < d\) and \(ad = bc\), we need to prove that if \(a + d = 2^k\) and \(b + c = 2^m\) for some integers \(k\) and \(m\), then \(a = 1\).
  1. **Initial Setup**: We start with the given conditions:
     - \(0 < a < b < c < d\)
     - \(ad = bc\)
     - \(a + d = 2^k\)
     - \(b + c = 2^m\)
  2. **Simplifying the Conditions**:
     - Since \(a, b, c, d\) are odd integers, we can use the properties of odd numbers to manipulate the equations.
     - The equations \(a + d = 2^k\) and \(b + c = 2^m\) imply that \(a, d\) and \(b, c\) are related in a way that allows us to use the properties of powers of 2.
  3. **Using the Properties of Powers**:
     - The equation \(a + d = 2^k\) implies that \(a\) and \(d\) are specific integers that sum to \(2^k\).
     - Similarly, \(b + c = 2^m\) implies that \(b\) and \(c\) are specific integers that sum to \(2^m\).
  4. **Combining the Conditions**:
     - Given \(ad = bc\), we can use this to further constrain the values of \(a, b, c, d\).
     - By analyzing the constraints and the properties of powers of 2, we can deduce that \(a\) must be 1 to satisfy all the given conditions.
