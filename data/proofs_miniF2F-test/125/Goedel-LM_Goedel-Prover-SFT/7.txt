  Given odd integers \(a, b, c, d\) such that \(0 < a < b < c < d\) and \(ad = bc\), we need to prove that if \(a + d = 2^k\) and \(b + c = 2^m\) for some integers \(k\) and \(m\), then \(a = 1\).
  1. From the given conditions, we know that \(a, b, c, d\) are odd integers.
  2. We are also given that \(0 < a < b < c < d\).
  3. The product \(ad = bc\) implies that the product of the smallest and largest numbers is equal to the product of the middle two numbers.
  4. Given \(a + d = 2^k\) and \(b + c = 2^m\), we can infer that the sum of the smallest and largest numbers is \(2^k\) and the sum of the middle two numbers is \(2^m\).
  5. Since \(a, b, c, d\) are odd integers and their product is \(2^k \cdot 2^m = 2^{k+m}\), we can deduce that the smallest number \(a\) must be 1 to satisfy the product condition.
