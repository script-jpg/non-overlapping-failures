  Given odd integers \(a, b, c, d\) such that \(0 < a < b < c < d\) and \(ad = bc\), we need to prove that if \(a + d = 2^k\) and \(b + c = 2^m\) for some integers \(k\) and \(m\), then \(a = 1\).
  1. **Normalization and Simplification**: We start by normalizing the given conditions using basic arithmetic operations.
  2. **Case Analysis**: We analyze the cases for \(a, b, c, d\) being odd and their relationships.
  3. **Algebraic Manipulation**: We use algebraic manipulation to simplify the expressions and derive the necessary conditions.
  4. **Verification**: Finally, we verify that the conditions lead to the conclusion that \(a = 1\).
