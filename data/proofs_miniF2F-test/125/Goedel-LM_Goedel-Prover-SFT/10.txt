  Given odd integers \(a, b, c, d\) such that \(0 < a < b < c < d\) and \(ad = bc\), we need to prove that if \(a + d = 2^k\) and \(b + c = 2^m\) for some integers \(k\) and \(m\), then \(a = 1\).
  1. **Normalization and Simplification**: We start by normalizing the given conditions using basic arithmetic operations.
  2. **Case Analysis**: We analyze the possible values of \(a, b, c, d\) under the given constraints.
  3. **Verification**: We verify that the only solution satisfying all conditions is \(a = 1\).
