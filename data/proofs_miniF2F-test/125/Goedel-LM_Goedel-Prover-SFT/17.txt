  Given odd integers \(a, b, c, d\) such that \(0 < a < b < c < d\) and \(ad = bc\), we need to prove that if \(a + d = 2^k\) and \(b + c = 2^m\) for some integers \(k\) and \(m\), then \(a = 1\).
  1. Since \(a, b, c, d\) are odd, we can express each of them as \(2k + 1\) for some integer \(k\).
  2. Given \(a + d = 2^k\), substituting \(a = 2k + 1\) and \(d = 2m + 1\), we get \(2k + 1 + 2m + 1 = 2^k\), which simplifies to \(2k + 2m + 2 = 2^k\).
  3. Given \(b + c = 2^m\), substituting \(b = 2m + 1\) and \(c = 2m + 1\), we get \(2m + 1 + 2m + 1 = 2^m\), which simplifies to \(4m + 2 = 2^m\).
  4. From \(4m + 2 = 2^m\), we can deduce that \(m\) must be 1 to satisfy the equation.
  5. Substituting \(m = 1\) into \(a + d = 2^k\), we get \(2k + 1 + 2m + 1 = 2^k\), which simplifies to \(2k + 4m + 2 = 2^k\).
  6. From \(2k + 4m + 2 = 2^k\), we can deduce that \(k\) must be 1 to satisfy the equation.
  7. Therefore, \(a = 2k + 1\) and \(d = 2m + 1\), and since \(m = 1\) and \(k = 1\), we have \(a = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3\) and \(d = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3\).
  8. Given the constraints \(0 < a < b < c < d\), the only possible value for \(a\) that satisfies all conditions is 1.
