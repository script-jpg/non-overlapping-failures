  Given odd integers \(a, b, c, d\) such that \(0 < a < b < c < d\) and \(ad = bc\), we need to prove that if \(a + d = 2^k\) and \(b + c = 2^m\) for some integers \(k\) and \(m\), then \(a = 1\).
  1. From the given conditions, we know that \(a, b, c, d\) are odd integers and satisfy \(0 < a < b < c < d\).
  2. We are also given that \(ad = bc\).
  3. We need to show that \(a + d = 2^k\) and \(b + c = 2^m\) for some integers \(k\) and \(m\).
  4. To prove that \(a = 1\), we can use the properties of the odd integers and the given equations.

  -- Extract the odd properties of a, b, c, and d from h₁
  rcases h₁ with ⟨h₁_a, h₁_b, h₁_c, h₁_d⟩
  -- Extract the properties of a, b, c, and d from h₀
  rcases h₀ with ⟨h₀_a, h₀_b, h₀_c, h₀_d⟩
  -- Use the properties of the odd integers and the given equations to prove that a = 1
  have h₆ : a = 1 := by
    -- Use the fact that a, b, c, d are odd and the given equations to derive a = 1
