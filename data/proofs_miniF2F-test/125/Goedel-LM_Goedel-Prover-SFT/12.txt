  Given odd integers \(a, b, c, d\) such that \(0 < a < b < c < d\) and \(ad = bc\), we need to prove that if \(a + d = 2^k\) and \(b + c = 2^m\) for some integers \(k\) and \(m\), then \(a = 1\).
  1. From the given conditions, we know that \(a, b, c, d\) are odd integers.
  2. Since \(a, b, c, d\) are odd, we can express each of them as \(a = 2n + 1\), \(b = 2n + 3\), \(c = 2n + 5\), and \(d = 2n + 7\) for some integer \(n\).
  3. Given \(a + d = 2^k\), we have:
     \[
     (2n + 1) + (2n + 7) = 2^k \implies 4n + 8 = 2^k \implies 4n = 2^k - 8
     \]
  4. Similarly, given \(b + c = 2^m\), we have:
     \[
     (2n + 3) + (2n + 5) = 2^m \implies 4n + 8 = 2^m \implies 4n = 2^m - 8
     \]
  5. From \(4n = 2^k - 8\) and \(4n = 2^m - 8\), we get:
     \[
     2^k - 8 = 2^m - 8 \implies 2^k = 2^m \implies k = m
     \]
  6. Therefore, \(k = m\).
  7. If \(k = m\), then:
     \[
     4n = 2^k - 8 = 2^m - 8 \implies 4n = 2^k - 8 = 2^m - 8 \implies n = 0
     \]
  8. Thus, \(a = 2n + 1 = 2 \cdot 0 + 1 = 1\).
