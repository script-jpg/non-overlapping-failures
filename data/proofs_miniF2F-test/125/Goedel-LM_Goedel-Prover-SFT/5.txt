  Given odd integers \(a, b, c, d\) such that \(0 < a < b < c < d\) and \(ad = bc\), we need to prove that if \(a + d = 2^k\) and \(b + c = 2^m\) for some integers \(k\) and \(m\), then \(a = 1\).
  1. **Normalization and Simplification**: We start by normalizing the given conditions using basic arithmetic operations.
  2. **Case Analysis**: We analyze the cases for \(a, b, c, d\) being odd or even, and use the properties of odd and even numbers to derive the necessary conditions.
  3. **Using Properties of Odd and Even Numbers**: We use the properties of odd and even numbers, specifically that the product of an odd number and an even number is even, and the sum of an odd number and an even number is odd.
  4. **Conclusion**: By applying the properties of odd and even numbers and the given conditions, we conclude that \(a = 1\).
