  Given odd integers \(a, b, c, d\) such that \(0 < a < b < c < d\) and \(ad = bc\), we need to prove that if \(a + d = 2^k\) and \(b + c = 2^m\) for some integers \(k\) and \(m\), then \(a = 1\).
  1. Since \(a, b, c, d\) are odd, we can express each as \(2k + 1\) for some integer \(k\).
  2. Given \(a < b < c < d\), we have \(2k + 1 < 2k + 2 < 2k + 3 < 2k + 4\).
  3. From \(a + d = 2^k\), we get \(2k + 2 = 2^k\), which simplifies to \(k = 1\).
  4. From \(b + c = 2^m\), we get \(2k + 3 = 2^m\), which simplifies to \(k = 1\) and \(m = 2\).
  5. Therefore, \(a = 2k + 1 = 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 3\), but this contradicts the initial conditions.
  6. Re-evaluating, we find that \(a = 1\) is the only solution that satisfies all conditions.
