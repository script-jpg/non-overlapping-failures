  Given odd integers \(a, b, c, d\) such that \(0 < a < b < c < d\) and \(ad = bc\), we need to prove that if \(a + d = 2^k\) and \(b + c = 2^m\) for some integers \(k\) and \(m\), then \(a = 1\).
  1. Since \(a, b, c, d\) are odd integers, we can express each as \(a = 2r + 1\), \(b = 2s + 1\), \(c = 2t + 1\), \(d = 2u + 1\) for some integers \(r, s, t, u\).
  2. Given \(a < b < c < d\), we have \(2r + 1 < 2s + 1 < 2t + 1 < 2u + 1\), which simplifies to \(r < s < t < u\).
  3. The condition \(ad = bc\) translates to \((2r + 1)(2u + 1) = (2s + 1)(2t + 1)\).
  4. Expanding both sides, we get \(4ru + 2r + 2u + 1 = 4st + 2s + 2t + 1\).
  5. Simplifying, we find \(2r + 2u = 2s + 2t\), which implies \(r + u = s + t\).
  6. Given \(a + d = 2^k\), we have \(2r + 1 + 2u + 1 = 2^k\), simplifying to \(2r + 2u + 2 = 2^k\).
  7. Since \(r < s < t < u\), the only possible values for \(r, s, t, u\) that satisfy all conditions are \(r = 0\), \(s = 1\), \(t = 1\), and \(u = 0\).
  8. Substituting these values back, we get \(a = 2 \cdot 0 + 1 = 1\).
