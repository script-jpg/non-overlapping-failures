  Given odd integers \(a, b, c, d\) such that \(0 < a < b < c < d\) and \(ad = bc\), we need to prove that if \(a + d = 2^k\) and \(b + c = 2^m\) for some integers \(k\) and \(m\), then \(a = 1\).
  1. From the given conditions, we know that \(a, b, c, d\) are odd integers and \(a < b < c < d\).
  2. We are also given that \(a + d = 2^k\) and \(b + c = 2^m\).
  3. Since \(a\) and \(d\) are odd, \(a + d\) is even.
  4. Similarly, since \(b\) and \(c\) are odd, \(b + c\) is even.
  5. Given \(a + d = 2^k\) and \(b + c = 2^m\), we can infer that \(2^k\) and \(2^m\) must be even.
  6. The only way for \(2^k\) and \(2^m\) to be even is if \(k\) and \(m\) are odd.
  7. However, since \(k\) and \(m\) are integers, \(2^k\) and \(2^m\) cannot be odd, leading to a contradiction.
  8. Therefore, the only possible value for \(a\) that satisfies the given conditions is \(a = 1\).
