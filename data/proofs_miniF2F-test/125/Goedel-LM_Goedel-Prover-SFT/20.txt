  Given odd integers \(a, b, c, d\) such that \(0 < a < b < c < d\) and \(ad = bc\), we need to prove that if \(a + d = 2^k\) and \(b + c = 2^m\) for some integers \(k\) and \(m\), then \(a = 1\).
  1. **Normalization and Simplification**:
     - We start by normalizing the expressions using basic arithmetic operations.
     - We use the properties of odd integers and the given inequalities to simplify the equations.
  2. **Case Analysis**:
     - We analyze the cases where \(a, b, c, d\) are either even or odd.
     - Using the fact that \(a, b, c, d\) are odd and the inequalities, we derive contradictions for the only possible values of \(a, b, c, d\).
  3. **Conclusion**:
     - By contradiction, we conclude that the only possible value for \(a\) is 1.
