  Given odd integers \(a, b, c, d\) such that \(0 < a < b < c < d\) and \(ad = bc\), we need to prove that if \(a + d = 2^k\) and \(b + c = 2^m\) for some integers \(k\) and \(m\), then \(a = 1\).
  1. From the given conditions, we know that \(a, b, c, d\) are odd and satisfy the inequalities \(0 < a < b < c < d\).
  2. The equation \(ad = bc\) implies a relationship between the products of \(a, b, c, d\).
  3. Given \(a + d = 2^k\), we can express \(d\) in terms of \(a\) and \(k\).
  4. Similarly, given \(b + c = 2^m\), we can express \(c\) in terms of \(b\) and \(m\).
  5. Using the inequalities and the fact that \(a, b, c, d\) are odd, we can deduce that \(a\) must be 1 to satisfy all conditions.
