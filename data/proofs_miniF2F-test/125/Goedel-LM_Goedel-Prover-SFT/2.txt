  Given odd integers \(a, b, c, d\) such that \(0 < a < b < c < d\) and \(ad = bc\), we need to prove that if \(a + d = 2^k\) and \(b + c = 2^m\) for some integers \(k\) and \(m\), then \(a = 1\).
  1. Since \(a, b, c, d\) are odd and positive, we can use the properties of odd numbers and the given inequalities to derive the necessary equalities.
  2. Given \(a < b < c < d\), we can infer that \(a\) must be less than \(b\) and \(c\) must be greater than \(d\).
  3. The product \(ad = bc\) implies that \(a\) and \(d\) must be factors of \(b\) and \(c\).
  4. Given the constraints \(a < b < c < d\), we can deduce that \(a\) must be 1 to satisfy the inequalities and the equality \(ad = bc\).
