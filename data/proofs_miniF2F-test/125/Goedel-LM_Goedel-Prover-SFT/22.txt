  Given odd integers \(a, b, c, d\) such that \(0 < a < b < c < d\) and \(ad = bc\), we need to prove that if \(a + d = 2^k\) and \(b + c = 2^m\) for some integers \(k\) and \(m\), then \(a = 1\).
  1. From the given conditions, we know that \(a + d = 2^k\) and \(b + c = 2^m\).
  2. Since \(a, b, c, d\) are odd, we can express \(a, b, c, d\) as \(2k + 1\), \(2m + 1\), and so on.
  3. Given the inequalities \(0 < a < b < c < d\), we can infer that \(a\) must be the smallest among \(a, b, c, d\).
  4. Given \(ad = bc\), we can use the properties of odd numbers and the fact that \(a, b, c, d\) are odd to derive a contradiction if \(a \neq 1\).
  5. By the properties of odd numbers and the given conditions, we can conclude that \(a = 1\).
