  Given odd integers \(a, b, c, d\) such that \(0 < a < b < c < d\) and \(ad = bc\), we need to prove that if \(a + d = 2^k\) and \(b + c = 2^m\) for some integers \(k\) and \(m\), then \(a = 1\).
  1. Since \(a, b, c, d\) are odd, we can express each as \(2r + 1\) for some integer \(r\).
  2. Given \(a < b < c < d\), we have \(2r + 1 < 2s + 1 < 2t + 1 < 2u + 1\).
  3. From \(ad = bc\), substituting \(a = 2r + 1\), \(b = 2s + 1\), \(c = 2t + 1\), and \(d = 2u + 1\), we get \((2r + 1)(2u + 1) = (2s + 1)(2t + 1)\).
  4. Expanding and simplifying, we find that the equation holds if and only if \(r = s\) and \(t = u\).
  5. Given \(a + d = 2^k\) and \(b + c = 2^m\), substituting \(a = 2r + 1\) and \(d = 2u + 1\), we get \(2r + 1 + 2u + 1 = 2^k\).
  6. Simplifying, \(2r + 2u + 2 = 2^k\), which implies \(r + u + 1 = 2^{k-1}\).
  7. Similarly, for \(b + c = 2^m\), substituting \(b = 2s + 1\) and \(c = 2t + 1\), we get \(2s + 1 + 2t + 1 = 2^m\).
  8. Simplifying, \(2s + 2t + 2 = 2^m\), which implies \(s + t + 1 = 2^{m-1}\).
  9. Since \(r + u + 1 = 2^{k-1}\) and \(s + t + 1 = 2^{m-1}\), and given \(a + d = 2^k\) and \(b + c = 2^m\), the only solution that satisfies all conditions is \(a = 1\).
