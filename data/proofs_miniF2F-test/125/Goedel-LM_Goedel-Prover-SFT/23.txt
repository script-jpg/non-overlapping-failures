  Given odd integers \(a, b, c, d\) such that \(0 < a < b < c < d\) and \(ad = bc\), we need to prove that if \(a + d = 2^k\) and \(b + c = 2^m\) for some integers \(k\) and \(m\), then \(a = 1\).
  1. From the given conditions, we know:
     - \(0 < a < b < c < d\)
     - \(ad = bc\)
     - \(a + d = 2^k\)
     - \(b + c = 2^m\)
  2. Since \(a, b, c, d\) are odd, we can express each of them as \(2n + 1\) for some integer \(n\).
  3. Using the condition \(ad = bc\), we substitute \(a = 2n + 1\) and \(d = 2m + 1\) into the equation:
     \[
     (2n + 1)(2m + 1) = (2n + 1)(2m + 1)
     \]
  4. Simplifying the equation, we get:
     \[
     4nm + 2n + 2m + 1 = 4nm + 2n + 2m + 1
     \]
  5. This simplifies to:
     \[
     0 = 0
     \]
  6. Since \(a + d = 2^k\), we substitute \(a = 2n + 1\) and \(d = 2m + 1\):
     \[
     (2n + 1) + (2m + 1) = 2^k
     \]
  7. Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     2n + 2m + 2 = 2^k
     \]
  8. Since \(b + c = 2^m\), we substitute \(b = 2n + 1\) and \(c = 2m + 1\):
     \[
     (2n + 1) + (2m + 1) = 2^m
     \]
  9. Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     2n + 2m + 2 = 2^m
     \]
  10. Combining the equations, we find that \(n = 0\) and \(m = 0\), leading to \(a = 1\).
