  Given odd integers \(a, b, c, d\) such that \(0 < a < b < c < d\) and \(ad = bc\), we need to prove that if \(a + d = 2^k\) and \(b + c = 2^m\) for some integers \(k\) and \(m\), then \(a = 1\).
  1. **Normalization and Simplification**: We start by normalizing the given equations using basic arithmetic operations.
  2. **Case Analysis**: We analyze the possible values of \(a, b, c, d\) given the constraints. Since \(a, b, c, d\) are odd integers and their products and sums are given, we can use these to derive the value of \(a\).
  3. **Verification**: Finally, we verify that the derived value of \(a\) satisfies all the given conditions.
