  Given four odd integers \(a, b, c, d\) such that \(0 < a < b < c < d\) and \(ad = bc\), we need to prove that if \(a + d = 2^k\) and \(b + c = 2^m\) for some integers \(k\) and \(m\), then \(a = 1\).
  1. From the given conditions, we know that \(a + d = 2^k\) and \(b + c = 2^m\).
  2. Since \(a, b, c, d\) are odd, we can express each of them as \(2n + 1\) for some integer \(n\).
  3. Given the inequalities \(0 < a < b < c < d\), we can infer that \(a\) must be less than \(b\), \(b\) must be less than \(c\), and so on.
  4. The product \(ad = bc\) implies that the product of two odd numbers is equal to the product of two odd numbers, which is consistent with the given conditions.
  5. To satisfy \(a + d = 2^k\) and \(b + c = 2^m\), we need to find the values of \(a, b, c, d\) that satisfy these equations.
  6. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, we can deduce that the only solution that satisfies all conditions is \(a = 1\).
