  Given odd integers \(a, b, c, d\) such that \(0 < a < b < c < d\) and \(ad = bc\), we need to prove that if \(a + d = 2^k\) and \(b + c = 2^m\) for some integers \(k\) and \(m\), then \(a = 1\).
  1. From the given conditions, we know that \(a, b, c, d\) are odd integers and satisfy the inequalities \(0 < a < b < c < d\).
  2. The product \(ad = bc\) implies that the product of the two largest numbers is equal to the product of the two smallest numbers.
  3. The sum \(a + d = 2^k\) and \(b + c = 2^m\) imply that the sum of the two smallest numbers is a power of 2 and the sum of the two largest numbers is also a power of 2.
  4. Given the inequalities \(0 < a < b < c < d\), the only possible value for \(a\) that satisfies \(a + d = 2^k\) and \(b + c = 2^m\) is \(a = 1\).
