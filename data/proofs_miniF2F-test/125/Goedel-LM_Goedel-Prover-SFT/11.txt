  Given odd integers \(a, b, c, d\) such that \(0 < a < b < c < d\) and \(ad = bc\), we need to prove that if \(a + d = 2^k\) and \(b + c = 2^m\) for some integers \(k\) and \(m\), then \(a = 1\).
  1. From the given conditions, we know that \(a, b, c, d\) are odd integers and \(0 < a < b < c < d\).
  2. We also have the equations \(ad = bc\) and \(a + d = 2^k\) and \(b + c = 2^m\).
  3. Since \(a, b, c, d\) are odd, we can use the properties of odd numbers to derive the necessary conditions.
  4. Given \(a + d = 2^k\) and \(b + c = 2^m\), we can use the fact that the sum of two odd numbers is even, and the product of two odd numbers is odd.
  5. From \(ad = bc\), we know that the product of \(a\) and \(d\) is equal to the product of \(b\) and \(c\).
  6. Given the constraints \(0 < a < b < c < d\), we can deduce that \(a\) must be 1 to satisfy the equation \(a + d = 2^k\) and the fact that \(d\) is a positive integer.
  7. Similarly, \(b\) must be 1 to satisfy the equation \(b + c = 2^m\) and the fact that \(c\) is a positive integer.
  8. Therefore, \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\), and the other conditions are satisfied.
