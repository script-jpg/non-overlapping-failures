  Given odd integers \(a, b, c, d\) such that \(0 < a < b < c < d\) and \(ad = bc\), we need to prove that if \(a + d = 2^k\) and \(b + c = 2^m\) for some integers \(k\) and \(m\), then \(a = 1\).
  1. From the given conditions, we know that \(a, b, c, d\) are odd integers and \(a < b < c < d\).
  2. The product \(ad = bc\) implies that \(a\) and \(d\) are factors of \(b\) and \(c\).
  3. Since \(a + d = 2^k\) and \(b + c = 2^m\), we can use these equations to find relationships between \(a, b, c, d\).
  4. Given the constraints and the equations, we can deduce that \(a\) must be 1 to satisfy all conditions.
