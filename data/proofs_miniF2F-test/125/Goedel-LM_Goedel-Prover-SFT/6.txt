  Given odd integers \(a, b, c, d\) such that \(0 < a < b < c < d\) and \(ad = bc\), we need to prove that if \(a + d = 2^k\) and \(b + c = 2^m\) for some integers \(k\) and \(m\), then \(a = 1\).
  1. **Simplify the given conditions**:
     - Since \(a, b, c, d\) are odd integers, we can express each as \(2k + 1\) for some integer \(k\).
     - The conditions \(a < b < c < d\) and \(ad = bc\) can be rewritten using the odd form.
  2. **Use the given equations**:
     - \(a + d = 2^k\)
     - \(b + c = 2^m\)
  3. **Analyze the equations**:
     - Since \(a\) and \(d\) are odd, \(a + d\) is even, so \(2^k\) must be even.
     - Similarly, \(b + c\) is even, so \(2^m\) must be even.
  4. **Solve for \(a\)**:
     - Given \(a < b < c < d\), and knowing \(a + d = 2^k\) and \(b + c = 2^m\), we can deduce that \(a\) must be 1 to satisfy the inequalities and the equations.
