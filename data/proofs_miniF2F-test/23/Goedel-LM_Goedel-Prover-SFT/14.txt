  To solve the problem, we need to find the relationship between the number of ligs, lags, and lugs on planet Larky. Given the following conditions:
  1. 7 ligs = 4 lags
  2. 9 lags = 20 lugs
  We need to determine how many ligs are equivalent to 80 lugs. We start by expressing the number of ligs in terms of the number of lags and then convert that into lugs.
  First, we use the given equations:
  - \( 9b = 20c \) (9 lags = 20 lugs)
  - \( 7a = 4b \) (7 ligs = 4 lags)
  From these equations, we can solve for \( b \) in terms of \( c \) and then substitute back to find \( a \) in terms of \( c \).
  From \( 9b = 20c \), we get:
  \[ b = \frac{20c}{9} \]
  Substituting \( b \) into \( 7a = 4b \):
  \[ 7a = 4 \left( \frac{20c}{9} \right) \]
  \[ 7a = \frac{80c}{9} \]
  \[ a = \frac{80c}{63} \]
  Now, we need to verify that 63 ligs are equivalent to 80 lugs:
  \[ 63a = 80c \]
  Substituting \( a = \frac{80c}{63} \):
  \[ 63 \left( \frac{80c}{63} \right) = 80c \]
  \[ 63a = 80c \]
  Thus, we have shown that 63 ligs are equivalent to 80 lugs.

  -- We start by solving the system of equations to express a and b in terms of c.
  have h₃ : 63 * a = 80 * c := by
    -- From 9b = 20c, we get b = 20c / 9.
    -- Substituting b into 7a = 4b, we get a = 80c / 63.
    -- Now, we verify that 63a = 80c.
