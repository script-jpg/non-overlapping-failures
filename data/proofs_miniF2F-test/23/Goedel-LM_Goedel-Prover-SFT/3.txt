  Given the relationships on planet Larky:
  1. 7 ligs = 4 lags
  2. 9 lags = 20 lugs
  We need to find how many ligs are equivalent to 80 lugs.
  First, we express the relationships in terms of equations:
  - \( 7a = 4b \)
  - \( 9b = 20c \)
  From these equations, we can derive:
  - \( a = \frac{4b}{7} \)
  - \( b = \frac{20c}{9} \)
  Substituting \( b \) in terms of \( c \) into the expression for \( a \):
  - \( a = \frac{4 \left( \frac{20c}{9} \right)}{7} = \frac{80c}{63} \)
  Thus, to find how many ligs are equivalent to 80 lugs, we multiply both sides by 63:
  - \( 63a = 80c \)
  This shows that 63 ligs are equivalent to 80 lugs.
