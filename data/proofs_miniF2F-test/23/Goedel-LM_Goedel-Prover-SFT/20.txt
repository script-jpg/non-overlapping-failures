  Given the relationships:
  1. \( 9 \text{ lags} = 20 \text{ lugs} \)
  2. \( 7 \text{ ligs} = 4 \text{ lags} \)
  We need to show that \( 63 \text{ ligs} = 80 \text{ lugs} \).
  First, we express the relationships in terms of equations:
  - \( 9b = 20c \)
  - \( 7a = 4b \)
  Next, we manipulate these equations to find a relationship between \( a \) and \( c \).
  From \( 7a = 4b \), we can express \( b \) in terms of \( a \):
  \[ b = \frac{7a}{4} \]
  Substitute \( b \) into the first equation:
  \[ 9 \left( \frac{7a}{4} \right) = 20c \]
  \[ \frac{63a}{4} = 20c \]
  \[ 63a = 80c \]
  Thus, we have shown that \( 63 \text{ ligs} = 80 \text{ lugs} \).
