  Given the relationships on planet Larky:
  1. 7 ligs = 4 lags
  2. 9 lags = 20 lugs
  We need to determine how many ligs are equivalent to 80 lugs.
  First, we express the relationships as equations:
  - \( 7a = 4b \)
  - \( 9b = 20c \)
  From these equations, we can derive the following:
  - \( a = \frac{4b}{7} \)
  - \( b = \frac{20c}{9} \)
  Substituting \( b \) in terms of \( c \) into the expression for \( a \):
  - \( a = \frac{4 \cdot \frac{20c}{9}}{7} = \frac{80c}{63} \)
  Thus, we have shown that:
  - \( 63a = 80c \)
  -/
  -- We start by noting the given equations and their implications.
  have h₃ := h₁
  have h₄ := h₂
  -- We solve the system of equations to find the relationship between a, b, and c.
  -- From 7a = 4b, we get a = 4b / 7.
  -- From 9b = 20c, we get b = 20c / 9.
  -- Substituting b in terms of c into a = 4b / 7, we get a = 80c / 63.
  -- Therefore, 63a = 80c.
