  Given the relationships between ligs, lags, and lugs:
  1. 7 ligs = 4 lags
  2. 9 lags = 20 lugs
  We need to determine how many ligs are equivalent to 80 lugs.
  First, we use the second relationship to express lugs in terms of lags:
  \[ 1 \text{ lag} = \frac{9}{20} \text{ lugs} \]
  Next, we substitute this expression into the first relationship to find the relationship between ligs and lugs:
  \[ 1 \text{ jig} = \frac{9}{20} \text{ lugs} \]
  To find the number of ligs equivalent to 80 lugs, we multiply both sides of the equation by 80 and simplify:
  \[ 80 \text{ lugs} = 80 \times \frac{9}{20} \text{ lugs} \]
  Simplifying the right-hand side:
  \[ 80 \times \frac{9}{20} = 80 \times \frac{9}{20} = 80 \times \frac{9}{20} = 36 \text{ lugs} \]
  Thus, 63 ligs are equivalent to 80 lugs.

  -- Substitute the expression for lugs into the first relationship to find the relationship between ligs and lugs.
  have h₄ : 1 * a = 4 * b / 7 := by linarith
  -- Multiply both sides of the equation by 80 and simplify to find the number of ligs equivalent to 80 lugs.
  have h₅ : 63 * a = 80 * c := by linarith
  -- Finally, we conclude that 63 ligs are equivalent to 80 lugs.
