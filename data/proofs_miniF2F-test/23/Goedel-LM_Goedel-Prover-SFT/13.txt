  Given the relationships on planet Larky:
  1. 7 ligs = 4 lags
  2. 9 lags = 20 lugs
  We need to show that 63 ligs are equivalent to 80 lugs.
  First, we express the relationships in terms of equations:
  \[ 9b = 20c \]
  \[ 7a = 4b \]
  From the first equation, we can express \(b\) in terms of \(c\):
  \[ b = \frac{20c}{9} \]
  Substituting \(b\) into the second equation:
  \[ 7a = 4 \left(\frac{20c}{9}\right) \]
  \[ 7a = \frac{80c}{9} \]
  Solving for \(a\):
  \[ a = \frac{80c}{63} \]
  Now, we need to verify that 63 ligs are equivalent to 80 lugs:
  \[ 63a = 80c \]
  Substituting \(a = \frac{80c}{63}\):
  \[ 63 \left(\frac{80c}{63}\right) = 80c \]
  \[ 80c = 80c \]
  Thus, the equivalence holds.

  have h₄ : 63 * a = 80 * c := by
    -- From the given relationships, we derive the following:
    -- 9b = 20c => b = (20c) / 9
    -- 7a = 4b => a = (4b) / 7
    -- Substituting b = (20c) / 9 into a = (4b) / 7, we get:
    -- a = (4 * (20c) / 9) / 7 = (80c) / 63
    -- Now, we need to verify that 63a = 80c:
    -- 63a = 63 * ((80c) / 63) = 80c
