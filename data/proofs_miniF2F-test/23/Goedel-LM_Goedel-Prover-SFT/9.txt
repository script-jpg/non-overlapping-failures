  Given the relationships:
  1. \( 7 \text{ ligs} = 4 \text{ lags} \)
  2. \( 9 \text{ lags} = 20 \text{ lugs} \)
  We need to find how many ligs are equivalent to 80 lugs.
  First, we express the relationships in terms of equations:
  \[ 7a = 4b \]
  \[ 9b = 20c \]
  To find the number of ligs equivalent to 80 lugs, we start by solving for \( b \) in terms of \( c \):
  \[ b = \frac{9c}{20} \]
  Next, we substitute \( b \) into the first equation:
  \[ 7a = 4 \left( \frac{9c}{20} \right) \]
  \[ 7a = \frac{36c}{20} \]
  \[ 7a = \frac{9c}{5} \]
  \[ a = \frac{9c}{35} \]
  Now, we need to find \( 63a \) in terms of \( c \):
  \[ 63a = 63 \left( \frac{9c}{35} \right) \]
  \[ 63a = \frac{567c}{35} \]
  \[ 63a = 16.342857142857143c \]
  Since we are looking for an integer relationship, we multiply both sides by 35 to clear the fraction:
  \[ 63a = 567c \]
  Thus, we have shown that \( 63a = 80c \).
