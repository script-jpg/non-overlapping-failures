  To solve the problem, we need to find the relationship between the quantities \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) given the following conditions:
  1. \( 7a = 4b \)
  2. \( 9b = 20c \)
  We need to show that \( 63a = 80c \).
  First, we use the given equations to express \( b \) and \( c \) in terms of \( a \):
  From \( 7a = 4b \), we get \( b = \frac{7a}{4} \).
  From \( 9b = 20c \), we get \( c = \frac{9b}{20} \).
  Substituting \( b = \frac{7a}{4} \) into the equation for \( c \):
  \[ c = \frac{9 \left( \frac{7a}{4} \right)}{20} = \frac{63a}{80} \]
  Now, we need to verify that \( 63a = 80c \):
  \[ 63a = 80 \left( \frac{63a}{80} \right) = 63a \]
  Thus, the relationship holds true.

  -- We start by using the given equations to express b and c in terms of a.
  have h₀' := h₀.2.2 -- Extract the positivity condition for c.
  have h₁' := h₀.2.1 -- Extract the positivity condition for b.
  have h₂' := h₀.1 -- Extract the positivity condition for a.
  have h₃ := h₁ -- Use the second given equation.
  have h₄ := h₂ -- Use the first given equation.
  -- We use the `linarith` tactic to solve the system of linear equations.
  -- This tactic will handle the substitution and simplification automatically.
