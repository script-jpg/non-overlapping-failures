  Given the equations:
  1. \( 7a = 4b \)
  2. \( 9b = 20c \)
  We need to find the relationship between \( a \) and \( c \) in the equation \( 63a = 80c \).
  First, solve the first equation for \( b \):
  \[ b = \frac{7a}{4} \]
  Next, substitute \( b \) into the second equation:
  \[ 9 \left( \frac{7a}{4} \right) = 20c \]
  Simplify the equation:
  \[ \frac{63a}{4} = 20c \]
  Multiply both sides by 4 to clear the fraction:
  \[ 63a = 80c \]
  Thus, we have shown that \( 63a = 80c \).

  -- Solve the first equation for b
  have b_eq : b = 7 * a / 4 := by linarith
  -- Substitute b into the second equation
  have eq : 9 * (7 * a / 4) = 20 * c := by linarith
  -- Simplify the equation to show the relationship between a and c
