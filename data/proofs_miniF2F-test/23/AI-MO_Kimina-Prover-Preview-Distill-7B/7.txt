-- The basic strategy is to first show that 105 ligs = 160 lugs, and then scale up by the appropriate factor.

  -- First, we need to show that 105 ligs = 160 lugs. This is a matter of combining the given ratios.

  have : 105 * a = 160 * c := by

    -- We know that 9 lags = 20 lugs, so multiplying both sides by 100/9 gives 100 lags = 2000/9 lugs.

    have : 100 * b = 2000 * c / 9 := by linarith

    -- We also know 7 ligs = 4 lags, so multiplying both sides by 25 gives 175 ligs = 100 lags.

    have : 175 * a = 100 * b := by linarith

    -- Composing the two relations gives 175 * a = 2000 * c / 9, which is the same as 105 * a = 160 * c.

    linarith

  -- Now we scale up: since 105 ligs = 160 lugs, multiplying both sides by 8/5 gives 84 ligs = 80 lugs.
