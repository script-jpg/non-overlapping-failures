# Solving the Ligs, Lags, and Lugs Problem in Lean 4

Let me analyze this problem step by step. We have conversion rates between three units: ligs, lags, and lugs. We need to find how many ligs are equivalent to 80 lugs.

First, let's establish the conversion rates from the problem statement:
- 7 ligs = 4 lags
- 9 lags = 20 lugs

We need to find how many ligs = 80 lugs.

Let's start by finding the relationship between ligs and lugs. We'll first convert lugs to lags using the second conversion rate, then to ligs using the first.

From 9 lags = 20 lugs, we get:
1 lug = 9/20 lags

So 80 lugs = 80 * (9/20) lags = 36 lags

Now, from 7 ligs = 4 lags, we get:
1 lag = 7/4 ligs

So 36 lags = 36 * (7/4) ligs = 63 ligs

Therefore, 80 lugs = 63 ligs.

Now, let's translate this to Lean 4 code:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

```

We need to import the necessary libraries and set up the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_398 (a b c : ℝ) (h₀ : 0 < a ∧ 0 < b ∧ 0 < c) (h₁ : 9 * b = 20 * c)
    (h₂ : 7 * a = 4 * b) : 63 * a = 80 * c := by
```

Here, we've defined the relationships:
- a represents the number of ligs
- b represents the number of lags
- c represents the number of lugs

From h₁: 9 * b = 20 * c, we have the conversion between lags and lugs
From h₂: 7 * a = 4 * b, we have the conversion between ligs and lags

Our goal is to prove that 63 * a = 80 * c, which means 63 ligs = 80 lugs

Let's solve this algebraically:
From h₁: 9b = 20c, we get b = (20/9)c
From h₂: 7a = 4b, we get a = (4/7)b = (4/7)(20/9)c = (80/63)c

So a = (80/63)c, which means 63a = 80c

Now, let's complete the Lean proof:

```tactics
field_simp at *
linarith
```

The Lean proof is remarkably concise! The `field_simp` tactic handles any field operations, and `linarith` solves linear arithmetic problems. These tactics together automatically solve systems of linear equations and inequalities, which is exactly what we have here.

So our complete Lean 4 solution is:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

theorem mathd_algebra_398 (a b c : ℝ) (h₀ : 0 < a ∧ 0 < b ∧ 0 < c) (h₁ : 9 * b = 20 * c)
    (h₂ : 7 * a = 4 * b) : 63 * a = 80 * c := by

And that's it! The Lean proof automatically solves the system of linear equations and proves that 63 * a = 80 * c, which means 63 ligs = 80 lugs.
