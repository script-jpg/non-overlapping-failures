The key insight is that we have conversion rates between these units:
- 7 ligs = 4 lags
- 9 lags = 20 lugs

We need to find how many ligs are equivalent to 80 lugs.

First, let's understand the problem better. We have:
- a: represents ligs
- b: represents lags
- c: represents lugs

The conversion rates are:
- 7 ligs = 4 lags means 7a = 4b
- 9 lags = 20 lugs means 9b = 20c

We need to find the value of x such that x a = 80 c

Let's start by thinking about how to approach this algebraically. We need to convert lugs to lags using the relation 9b = 20c, and then convert lags to ligs using 7a = 4b.

From 9b = 20c, we get b = (20/9)c
From 7a = 4b, we get a = (4/7)b

Substituting b from the first equation into the second, we get:
a = (4/7) * (20/9)c = (80/63)c

So 1c = (63/80)a
80c = 63a

This means 63 ligs equals 80 lugs.

Let's translate this to Lean 4 code:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

```

We're importing the necessary libraries and setting up the environment. The `maxHeartbeats 0` option allows Lean to run without limits on the number of steps, which is useful for complex arithmetic problems.

Now, let's define our theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_398 (a b c : ℝ) (h₀ : 0 < a ∧ 0 < b ∧ 0 < c) (h₁ : 9 * b = 20 * c)
    (h₂ : 7 * a = 4 * b) : 63 * a = 80 * c := by
```

We have:
- a > 0, b > 0, c > 0 (all quantities are positive)
- 9b = 20c (conversion between lugs and lags)
- 7a = 4b (conversion between ligs and lags)
- We need to prove 63a = 80c (equivalence between ligs and lugs)

Let's solve this algebraically again to verify:
From h₁: 9b = 20c, we get b = (20/9)c
From h₂: 7a = 4b, we get a = (4/7)b
Substituting b from h₁ into h₂: a = (4/7) * (20/9)c = (80/63)c
So 63a = 80c

This is exactly what we need to prove. Let's complete the proof in Lean:

```tactics
field_simp at *
linarith
```

The `field_simp` tactic simplifies expressions involving field operations, and `linarith` solves arithmetic goals with linear inequalities. These tactics work together to solve our arithmetic problem by:
1. Using the equations h₁ and h₂ to express b in terms of c and a in terms of b
2. Combining these to express a in terms of c
3. Verifying that 63a = 80c

Therefore, we have shown that 63 ligs are equivalent to 80 lugs, which is the answer to the problem.
