-- First, let's understand the problem: We have three units - ligs, lags, and lugs - with conversion relations:
  -- 7 ligs = 4 lags
  -- 9 lags = 20 lugs
  -- We need to find how many ligs are equivalent to 80 lugs.

  -- Let's start by setting up the basic structure of our proof:

  -- We have three real numbers representing the units: a (ligs), b (lags), c (lugs)
  -- We have positivity assumptions: all units are positive
  -- We have two conversion relations
  -- We need to prove that 63 ligs equals 80 lugs

  have h₃ : 63 * a = 80 * c := by
    linarith

  -- The key insight here is that we can use the conversion relations to set up a linear arithmetic problem.
  -- From 9 lags = 20 lugs, we get b = 20/9 * c
  -- From 7 ligs = 4 lags, we get a = 4/7 * b
  -- Substituting b from the second equation into the first: a = 4/7 * (20/9 * c) = 80/63 * c
  -- To find how many ligs equals 80 lugs: a * x = 80 * c, x = 80 * c / a = 80 * c / (80/63 * c) = 63
  -- Hence, 63 ligs equals 80 lugs.

  -- The `linarith` tactic is powerful enough to solve these kinds of linear arithmetic goals directly,
  -- as it can handle the algebraic manipulations needed to prove the equality.
