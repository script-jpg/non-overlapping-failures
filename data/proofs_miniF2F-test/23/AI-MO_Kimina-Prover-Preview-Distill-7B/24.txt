-- First, let's understand the problem: We have three units of currency on planet Larky - ligs, lags, and lugs.
  -- The exchange rates are given as:
  -- 7 ligs = 4 lags
  -- 9 lags = 20 lugs
  -- We need to find how many ligs are equivalent to 80 lugs.

  -- Let's start formalizing this in Lean 4. We need to import the appropriate libraries:

  import Mathlib
  import Aesop

  /-- On planet Larky, 7 ligs = 4 lags, and 9 lags = 20 lugs. How many ligs are equivalent to 80 lugs? Show that it is 63.-/
  theorem mathd_algebra_398 (a b c : ℝ) (h₀ : 0 < a ∧ 0 < b ∧ 0 < c) (h₁ : 9 * b = 20 * c)
      (h₂ : 7 * a = 4 * b) : 63 * a = 80 * c := by
  -- From the given, we have:
  -- 7 ligs = 4 lags, so 1 lig = 4/7 lag
  -- 9 lags = 20 lugs, so 1 lag = 20/9 lugs
  -- Therefore, 1 lig = 4/7 * 20/9 lugs = 80/63 lugs
  -- So 1 lug = 63/80 ligs
  -- Thus, 80 lugs = 63 ligs
