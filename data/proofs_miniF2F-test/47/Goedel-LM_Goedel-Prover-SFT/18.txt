  To show that for any real number \( a \), \( a(2 - a) \leq 1 \), we start by rewriting the expression \( a(2 - a) \) as \( 2a - a^2 \). We then use the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative to establish that \( (a - 1)^2 \geq 0 \). Expanding \( (a - 1)^2 \) gives \( a^2 - 2a + 1 \), which is non-negative. By rearranging this inequality, we can derive that \( 2a - a^2 \leq 1 \), completing the proof.

  -- Rewrite the expression a * (2 - a) as 2a - a^2
  have h₀ : a * (2 - a) = 2 * a - a ^ 2 := by ring
  rw [h₀]
  -- Use the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative
  have h₁ : (a - 1) ^ 2 ≥ 0 := by apply sq_nonneg
  -- Expand (a - 1)^2 to get a^2 - 2a + 1, which is non-negative
  have h₂ : (a - 1) ^ 2 = a ^ 2 - 2 * a + 1 := by ring
  rw [h₂] at h₁
  -- Rearrange the inequality to show 2a - a^2 ≤ 1
