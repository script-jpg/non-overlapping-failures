  To show that for any real number \( a \), \( a(2 - a) \leq 1 \), we can use the following steps:
  1. Consider the expression \( a(2 - a) \).
  2. Expand this expression to get \( 2a - a^2 \).
  3. Recognize that \( 2a - a^2 \) can be rewritten as \( a(2 - a) \).
  4. To prove \( a(2 - a) \leq 1 \), we need to show that \( 2a - a^2 \leq 1 \).
  5. This inequality can be verified by considering the non-negativity of the square of \( a - 1 \).
  6. Specifically, we know that \( (a - 1)^2 \geq 0 \) for any real number \( a \).
  7. Expanding \( (a - 1)^2 \) gives \( a^2 - 2a + 1 \), which is non-negative.
  8. Therefore, \( a^2 - 2a + 1 \geq 0 \), which implies \( 2a - a^2 \leq 1 \).
