  To show that for any real number \( a \), \( a(2 - a) \leq 1 \), we can use the following steps:
  1. Consider the expression \( a(2 - a) \).
  2. Rewrite it as \( 2a - a^2 \).
  3. Recognize that \( 2a - a^2 \) is a quadratic function in terms of \( a \).
  4. The maximum value of a quadratic function \( ax^2 + bx + c \) occurs at \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \).
  5. For \( 2a - a^2 \), the vertex of the parabola is at \( a = 1 \).
  6. Substitute \( a = 1 \) into the expression to get \( 2 \cdot 1 - 1^2 = 2 - 1 = 1 \).
  7. Since the quadratic function opens downwards (as the coefficient of \( a^2 \) is negative), the maximum value is at the vertex, and the value at the vertex is 1.
  8. Therefore, \( 2a - a^2 \leq 1 \) for all \( a \).

  -- Use the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative to establish the inequality.
  have : ∀ x : ℝ, x ^ 2 ≥ 0 := fun x => sq_nonneg x
  -- Apply this fact to the expression (a - 1).
  have h₁ : (a - 1) ^ 2 ≥ 0 := this (a - 1)
  -- Use linear arithmetic to conclude the proof.
