  To show that for any real number \( a \), \( a(2 - a) \leq 1 \), we start by rewriting the inequality in a more manageable form. We can express \( a(2 - a) \) as \( 2a - a^2 \). This expression can be rearranged to \( -a^2 + 2a \). We need to prove that \( -a^2 + 2a \leq 1 \).
  To do this, we can use the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative. Specifically, we consider the expression \( (a - 1)^2 \), which is non-negative for any real number \( a \). Expanding \( (a - 1)^2 \) gives \( a^2 - 2a + 1 \). Since \( (a - 1)^2 \geq 0 \), we have \( a^2 - 2a + 1 \geq 0 \). Adding 1 to both sides of this inequality yields \( a^2 - 2a + 2 \geq 1 \). Rearranging this inequality gives \( 2a - a^2 \leq 1 \), which is equivalent to \( a(2 - a) \leq 1 \).

  -- We use the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative.
  -- Specifically, we consider the expression (a - 1)^2, which is non-negative for any real number a.
  -- Expanding (a - 1)^2 gives a^2 - 2a + 1. Since (a - 1)^2 ≥ 0, we have a^2 - 2a + 1 ≥ 0.
  -- Adding 1 to both sides of this inequality yields a^2 - 2a + 2 ≥ 1.
  -- Rearranging this inequality gives 2a - a^2 ≤ 1, which is equivalent to a(2 - a) ≤ 1.
