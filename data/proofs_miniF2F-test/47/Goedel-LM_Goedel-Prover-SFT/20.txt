  To show that for any real number \( a \), \( a(2 - a) \leq 1 \), we start by considering the expression \( a(2 - a) \). We aim to prove that this expression is always less than or equal to 1. To do this, we can use the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative. Specifically, we will use the non-negativity of \( (a - 1)^2 \).
  First, we rewrite the inequality \( a(2 - a) \leq 1 \) in a form that allows us to use the non-negativity of the square. We can express this as:
  \[ a(2 - a) - 1 \leq 0 \]
  Next, we simplify the left-hand side:
  \[ a(2 - a) - 1 = 2a - a^2 - 1 \]
  We can rewrite this as:
  \[ 2a - a^2 - 1 = -(a^2 - 2a + 1) = -(a - 1)^2 \]
  Since the square of any real number is non-negative, \( (a - 1)^2 \geq 0 \). Therefore, \( -(a - 1)^2 \leq 0 \), which implies:
  \[ 2a - a^2 - 1 \leq 0 \]
  Thus, we have shown that \( a(2 - a) \leq 1 \).
