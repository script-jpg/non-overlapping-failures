  To show that for any real number \( a \), \( a(2-a) \leq 1 \), we can use the following steps:
  1. Consider the expression \( a(2-a) \).
  2. We can rewrite this expression as \( 2a - a^2 \).
  3. To prove \( 2a - a^2 \leq 1 \), we can rearrange the inequality to \( a^2 - 2a + 1 \geq 0 \).
  4. Notice that \( a^2 - 2a + 1 \) is a perfect square, specifically \( (a - 1)^2 \).
  5. Since the square of any real number is non-negative, \( (a - 1)^2 \geq 0 \).
  6. Therefore, \( a^2 - 2a + 1 \geq 0 \), which implies \( 2a - a^2 \leq 1 \).
  Thus, we have shown that \( a(2-a) \leq 1 \) for any real number \( a \).

  -- We use the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative.
  have h : ∀ x : ℝ, x ^ 2 ≥ 0 := fun x => by nlinarith
  -- Specifically, we consider the expression (a - 1)^2, which is non-negative.
  have h₁ : (a - 1) ^ 2 ≥ 0 := h (a - 1)
  -- Expanding (a - 1)^2 gives a^2 - 2a + 1, which is non-negative.
  have h₂ : a ^ 2 - 2 * a + 1 ≥ 0 := by linarith
  -- From a^2 - 2a + 1 ≥ 0, we can deduce 2a - a^2 ≤ 1.
  have h₃ : 2 * a - a ^ 2 ≤ 1 := by linarith
  -- Therefore, a(2-a) ≤ 1.
