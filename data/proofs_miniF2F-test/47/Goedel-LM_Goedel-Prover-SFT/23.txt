  To show that for any real number \( a \), \( a(2 - a) \leq 1 \), we start by rewriting the expression \( a(2 - a) \) as \( 2a - a^2 \). We then use the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative to establish the inequality. Specifically, we consider the expression \( (a - 1)^2 \), which is non-negative, and use it to derive the desired inequality.
