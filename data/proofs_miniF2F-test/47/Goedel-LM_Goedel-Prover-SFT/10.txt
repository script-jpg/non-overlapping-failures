  To show that for any real number \( a \), \( a(2 - a) \leq 1 \), we can use the following steps:
  1. Consider the expression \( a(2 - a) \).
  2. We can rewrite this expression as \( 2a - a^2 \).
  3. To prove \( 2a - a^2 \leq 1 \), we can use the fact that \( (a - 1)^2 \geq 0 \) for any real number \( a \).
  4. Expanding \( (a - 1)^2 \) gives \( a^2 - 2a + 1 \), which is always non-negative.
  5. Rearranging the inequality \( a^2 - 2a + 1 \geq 0 \) gives \( a^2 - 2a + 1 \geq 0 \).
  6. Adding \( 2a - 1 \) to both sides, we get \( a^2 + 1 \geq 2a \).
  7. Since \( a^2 + 1 \geq 2a \), we can conclude that \( 2a - a^2 \leq 1 \).

  -- We need to show that a * (2 - a) ≤ 1.
  have h₀ : a * (2 - a) ≤ 1 := by
    -- Use the fact that (a - 1)^2 is non-negative for any real number a.
    have h₀ : (a - 1) ^ 2 ≥ 0 := by
      -- This is always true since the square of any real number is non-negative.

    -- Using the non-negativity of (a - 1)^2, we can derive the desired inequality.

  -- The derived inequality is exactly what we need to prove.
