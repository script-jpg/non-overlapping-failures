  To show that for any real number \( a \), \( a(2 - a) \leq 1 \), we start by rewriting the inequality in a form that allows us to use algebraic manipulations. Specifically, we need to show that \( a(2 - a) - 1 \leq 0 \). This can be further simplified to \( 2a - a^2 - 1 \leq 0 \). Recognizing that \( 2a - a^2 \) is a quadratic expression, we can complete the square to express it as \( -(a - 1)^2 \). Since the square of any real number is non-negative, \( -(a - 1)^2 \leq 0 \), which implies \( 2a - a^2 - 1 \leq 0 \). Therefore, \( a(2 - a) \leq 1 \).
