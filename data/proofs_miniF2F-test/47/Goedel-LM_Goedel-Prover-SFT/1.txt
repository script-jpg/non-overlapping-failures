  To show that for any real number \( a \), \( a(2 - a) \leq 1 \), we start by rewriting the expression \( a(2 - a) \) as \( 2a - a^2 \). We then can express this as a square of a linear term, specifically \( (a - 1)^2 \). Since the square of any real number is non-negative, it follows that \( (a - 1)^2 \geq 0 \). Therefore, \( 2a - a^2 \leq 1 \).
