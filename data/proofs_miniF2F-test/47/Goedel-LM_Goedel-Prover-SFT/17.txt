  To show that for any real number \( a \), \( a(2 - a) \leq 1 \), we start by rewriting the inequality \( a(2 - a) \leq 1 \) in a form that allows us to use algebraic manipulations and known inequalities. Specifically, we can express this as \( (a - 1)^2 \geq 0 \). This inequality is always true because the square of any real number is non-negative. By expanding and simplifying the expression \( (a - 1)^2 \), we can see that it is indeed equivalent to \( a(2 - a) \).

  -- Rewrite the inequality in a form that allows us to use algebraic manipulations.
  -- Specifically, we can express this as (a - 1)^2 ≥ 0.
  have h : a * (2 - a) ≤ 1 := by
    -- We know that the square of any real number is non-negative.
    have h₀ : (a - 1) ^ 2 ≥ 0 := by apply sq_nonneg
    -- Expanding (a - 1)^2 gives a^2 - 2a + 1, which is equivalent to a(2 - a).
    have h₁ : (a - 1) ^ 2 = a * (2 - a) := by ring
    -- Using the above equivalence, we can rewrite the inequality.
    rw [h₁] at h₀
    -- Since (a - 1)^2 ≥ 0 is always true, we have a(2 - a) ≤ 1.

  -- The final result follows from the above steps.
