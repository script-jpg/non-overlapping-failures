  To show that for any real number \( a \), \( a(2 - a) \leq 1 \), we can use the following steps:
  1. Consider the expression \( a(2 - a) \).
  2. Expand and simplify the expression to \( 2a - a^2 \).
  3. Recognize that \( 2a - a^2 \) can be rewritten as \( -(a - 1)^2 \).
  4. Since the square of any real number is non-negative, \( -(a - 1)^2 \leq 0 \).
  5. Therefore, \( 2a - a^2 \leq 0 \), which implies \( a(2 - a) \leq 1 \).

  -- We start by noting that the square of any real number is non-negative.
  have h₀ : (a - 1) * (a - 1) ≥ 0 := by nlinarith
  -- We use the non-negativity of the square of (a - 1) to show that -(a - 1)^2 ≤ 0.
  have h₁ : -(a - 1) * (a - 1) ≤ 0 := by linarith
  -- From the non-negativity of -(a - 1)^2, we deduce that a(2 - a) ≤ 1.
  have h₂ : a * (2 - a) ≤ 1 := by linarith
  -- Finally, we conclude the proof by stating the exact inequality.
