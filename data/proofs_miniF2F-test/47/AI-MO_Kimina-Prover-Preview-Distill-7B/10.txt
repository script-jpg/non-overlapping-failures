-- $a(2-a) = -(a-1)^2 + 1 \leq 1$

  have : a * (2 - a) = -(a - 1)^2 + 1 := by ring

  rw [this]

 have : 0 ≤ (a - 1)^2 := by exact sq_nonneg (a - 1)

```

This completes the formal proof. The key insight is that $a(2-a)$ can be rewritten as $-(a-1)^2 + 1$, and since $(a-1)^2 \geq 0$ for all real $a$, it follows that $-(a-1)^2 \leq 0$, so $-(a-1)^2 + 1 \leq 1$.
