-- Transform the expression into a completed square form to identify its maximum value.

  have h : a * (2 - a) = -(a - 1)^2 + 1 := by ring

  -- Since the square of any real number is non-negative, $(a-1)^2 \geq 0$.

  have h1 : 0 ≤ (a - 1)^2 := sq_nonneg (a - 1)

  -- Therefore, $-(a-1)^2 \leq 0$, which implies $-(a-1)^2 + 1 \leq 1$.
