-- some auxilary inequality. Notice that square of any real number is nonnegative.

  have h : 0 ≤ (a - 1) ^ 2 := by

    exact sq_nonneg (a - 1)

  -- expand `h`, we get $a^2 - 2a + 1 \geq 0$.

  have h1 : a ^ 2 - 2 * a + 1 ≥ 0 := by

    linarith [h]

  -- rearrange the inequality, we get $a(2-a) \leq 1$.

  linarith [h1]
