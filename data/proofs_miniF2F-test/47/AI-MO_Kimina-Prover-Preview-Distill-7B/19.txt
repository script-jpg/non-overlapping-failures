This completes the proof that for any real number $a$, $a(2-a) \leq 1$.
The key insight is to transform the inequality into a form involving a square, which is always non-negative. By expanding and simplifying, we showed that $a(2-a) \leq 1$ is equivalent to $(a-1)^2 \geq 0$, which is true for all real numbers $a$ since squares are non-negative.
