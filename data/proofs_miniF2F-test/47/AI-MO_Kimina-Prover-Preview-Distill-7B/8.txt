This completes the proof that for any real number $a$, $a(2-a)\leq 1$.

The key insight is to rewrite $a(2-a)$ as $(a-1)^2 - 1$ and then use the fact that $(a-1)^2 \geq 0$ for any real number $a$. This is because the square of any real number is non-negative. Therefore, $(a-1)^2 - 1 \leq (a-1)^2$ and since $(a-1)^2 \geq 0$, we have $(a-1)^2 - 1 \leq (a-1)^2 \leq 1$.

The final answer is $ \boxed{1} $, which is the maximum value that $a(2-a)$ can approach but never exceed for any real $a$.
