  To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given equation \( x^2 + 18x + 30 = 2 \sqrt{x^2 + 18x + 45} \). We need to find the product of the real roots of this equation.
  1. **Square both sides to eliminate the square root**:
     \[
     (x^2 + 18x + 30)^2 = (2 \sqrt{x^2 + 18x + 45})^2
     \]
     Simplifying the right-hand side:
     \[
     4 (x^2 + 18x + 45) = 4x^2 + 72x + 180
     \]
     Thus, the equation becomes:
     \[
     (x^2 + 18x + 30)^2 = 4x^2 + 72x + 180
     \]
  2. **Expand and simplify the left-hand side**:
     \[
     x^4 + 36x^3 + 108x^2 + 90x + 900 = 4x^2 + 72x + 180
     \]
     Rearranging terms:
     \[
     x^4 + 36x^3 + 104x^2 + 24x + 720 = 0
     \]
  3. **Solve the polynomial equation**:
     We solve the polynomial equation \( x^4 + 36x^3 + 104x^2 + 24x + 720 = 0 \) to find the roots. Given that the roots are real and distinct, we use the fact that the product of the roots of a polynomial \( ax^n + bx^{n-1} + \ldots + k = 0 \) is given by \( \frac{-b}{a} \).
  4. **Calculate the product of the roots**:
     For the polynomial \( x^4 + 36x^3 + 104x^2 + 24x + 720 = 0 \), the product of the roots is:
     \[
     \frac{-24}{1} = -24
     \]
  However, this result does not match the expected product of 20. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the steps or the given conditions.
