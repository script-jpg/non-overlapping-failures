  To find the product of the real roots of the equation \( x^2 + 18x + 30 = 2 \sqrt{x^2 + 18x + 45} \), we start by simplifying the equation. We first square both sides to eliminate the square root, then solve the resulting equation for \( x \). The steps involve algebraic manipulation and simplification. After simplifying, we find that the product of the roots is 20.
