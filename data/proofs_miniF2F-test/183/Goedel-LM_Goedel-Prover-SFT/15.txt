  To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given equation \( x^2 + 18x + 30 = 2 \sqrt{x^2 + 18x + 45} \). We need to find the product of the real roots of this equation.
  1. **Equation Analysis**: The equation \( x^2 + 18x + 30 = 2 \sqrt{x^2 + 18x + 45} \) implies a relationship between the left-hand side and the right-hand side.
  2. **Root Finding**: The roots of the equation can be found by solving the equation and checking the conditions for the roots.
  3. **Product Calculation**: The product of the roots of the equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \) is given by \( \frac{c}{a} \).
  Given the specific equation \( x^2 + 18x + 30 = 2 \sqrt{x^2 + 18x + 45} \), we can derive the product of the roots by substituting and simplifying.
