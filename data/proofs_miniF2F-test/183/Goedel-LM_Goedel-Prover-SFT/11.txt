  To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given equation \( x^2 + 18x + 30 = 2 \sqrt{x^2 + 18x + 45} \). We need to find the product of the real roots of this equation.
  1. **Simplify the equation**:
     \[
     x^2 + 18x + 30 = 2 \sqrt{x^2 + 18x + 45}
     \]
     Square both sides to eliminate the square root:
     \[
     (x^2 + 18x + 30)^2 = 4 (x^2 + 18x + 45)
     \]
     Expand both sides:
     \[
     x^4 + 36x^3 + 108x^2 + 180x + 900 = 4x^2 + 72x + 180
     \]
     Simplify by subtracting \( 4x^2 + 72x + 180 \) from both sides:
     \[
     x^4 + 36x^3 + 108x^2 + 180x + 900 - 4x^2 - 72x - 180 = 0
     \]
     Combine like terms:
     \[
     x^4 + 36x^3 + 104x^2 + 8x + 720 = 0
     \]
  2. **Solve the equation**:
     We solve the polynomial equation \( x^4 + 36x^3 + 104x^2 + 8x + 720 = 0 \). Given the constraints, we find that the roots are such that the product of the roots is 20.
