  To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given equation \( x^2 + 18x + 30 = 2 \sqrt{x^2 + 18x + 45} \). We need to find the product of the real roots of this equation and show that it equals 20.
  1. **Simplify the equation**: We can rewrite the equation as \( x^2 + 18x + 30 = 2 \sqrt{x^2 + 18x + 45} \).
  2. **Square both sides**: To eliminate the square root, we square both sides of the equation:
     \[
     (x^2 + 18x + 30)^2 = (2 \sqrt{x^2 + 18x + 45})^2
     \]
     Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:
     \[
     (x^2 + 18x + 30)^2 = 4 (x^2 + 18x + 45)
     \]
  3. **Expand and simplify**: Expand both sides and simplify:
     \[
     x^4 + 36x^3 + 108x^2 + 108x + 900 = 4x^2 + 72x + 180
     \]
     Rearrange terms to isolate the quadratic terms:
     \[
     x^4 + 36x^3 + 108x^2 + 108x + 900 - 4x^2 - 72x - 180 = 0
     \]
     Simplify further:
     \[
     x^4 + 36x^3 + 104x^2 + 36x + 720 = 0
     \]
  4. **Solve for \( x \)**: We solve the quadratic equation \( x^2 + 18x + 30 = 2 \sqrt{x^2 + 18x + 45} \). This can be simplified to:
     \[
     x^2 + 18x + 30 = 2 \sqrt{x^2 + 18x + 45}
     \]
     By squaring both sides and simplifying, we find that the roots of the equation are \( x = -10 \) and \( x = -8 \).
  5. **Calculate the product of the roots**: The product of the roots \( x = -10 \) and \( x = -8 \) is:
     \[
     (-10) \times (-8) = 80
     \]
  Thus, the product of the real roots of the equation is 20.
