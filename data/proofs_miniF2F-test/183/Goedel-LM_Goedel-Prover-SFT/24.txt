  To solve the given equation \( x^2 + 18x + 30 = 2 \sqrt{x^2 + 18x + 45} \), we first simplify the equation by considering the square root and the properties of real numbers. We then solve for the roots of the equation and find their product.
  1. Start by isolating the square root term on one side of the equation.
  2. Square both sides to eliminate the square root.
  3. Simplify the resulting equation to find the roots.
  4. Use the properties of real numbers and algebraic manipulations to show that the product of the roots is 20.
