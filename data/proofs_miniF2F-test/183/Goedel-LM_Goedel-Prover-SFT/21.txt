  To solve the problem, we start by rewriting the given equation \( x^2 + 18x + 30 = 2 \sqrt{x^2 + 18x + 45} \) in a form that allows us to simplify and analyze the equation. We introduce a function \( f(x) = x^2 + 18x + 30 - 2 \sqrt{x^2 + 18x + 45} \) and show that the product of the roots of this equation is 20.
  1. **Simplify the function**: We first simplify the function \( f(x) \) by combining like terms and simplifying the square root expression.
  2. **Analyze the roots**: We need to find the roots of the equation \( f(x) = 0 \). This involves solving the quadratic equation and the square root equation.
  3. **Calculate the product of the roots**: Once we find the roots, we compute the product of the roots and verify that it equals 20.
