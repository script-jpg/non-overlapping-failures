  To solve the given equation \( x^2 + 18x + 30 = 2 \sqrt{x^2 + 18x + 45} \), we start by rewriting it in a more manageable form. We introduce the function \( f(x) = x^2 + 18x + 30 - 2 \sqrt{x^2 + 18x + 45} \). We need to find the product of the roots of the equation \( f(x) = 0 \).
  1. **Simplify the function**: We need to show that the product of the roots of the equation \( f(x) = 0 \) is 20.
  2. **Analyze the roots**: Given the complexity of the function \( f(x) \), we can infer that the roots are likely to be complex or involve square roots.
  3. **Use numerical methods**: Given the constraints and the nature of the equation, we can use numerical methods or algebraic manipulations to find the roots.
  4. **Calculate the product**: Once the roots are identified, we calculate their product.
