  To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given equation:
  \[ f(x) = x^2 + 18x + 30 - 2 \sqrt{x^2 + 18x + 45} \]
  We need to find the product of the real roots of the equation \( f(x) = 0 \). We are given that the product of the roots is 20.
  1. **Substitute the function into the equation**:
     \[ x^2 + 18x + 30 - 2 \sqrt{x^2 + 18x + 45} = 0 \]
  2. **Simplify the equation**:
     \[ x^2 + 18x + 30 = 2 \sqrt{x^2 + 18x + 45} \]
  3. **Square both sides to eliminate the square root**:
     \[ (x^2 + 18x + 30)^2 = 4 (x^2 + 18x + 45) \]
  4. **Expand and simplify**:
     \[ x^4 + 36x^3 + 72x^2 + 324x + 900 = 4x^2 + 72x + 180 \]
     \[ x^4 + 36x^3 + 68x^2 + 252x + 900 = 0 \]
  5. **Solve the polynomial equation**:
     Given the roots are real and the product of the roots is 20, we can use the fact that the sum of the roots of a polynomial \( ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e = 0 \) is \( -\frac{b}{a} \).
  6. **Calculate the product of the roots**:
     The product of the roots is given by \( \frac{e}{a} \). For the polynomial \( x^4 + 36x^3 + 68x^2 + 252x + 900 = 0 \), the product of the roots is:
     \[ \frac{900}{1} = 900 \]
  7. **Verify the product**:
     Given the roots are real and the product of the roots is 20, we need to verify that the product of the roots is indeed 20.
