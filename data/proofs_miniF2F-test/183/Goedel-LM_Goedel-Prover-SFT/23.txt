  To solve the given equation \( x^2 + 18x + 30 = 2 \sqrt{x^2 + 18x + 45} \), we start by isolating the square root term. We square both sides to eliminate the square root, resulting in:
  \[ (x^2 + 18x + 30)^2 = 4(x^2 + 18x + 45) \]
  Expanding both sides, we get:
  \[ x^4 + 36x^3 + 1296x^2 + 2250x + 9000 = 4x^2 + 72x + 180 \]
  Rearranging terms, we have:
  \[ x^4 + 36x^3 + 1296x^2 + 2250x + 9000 - 4x^2 - 72x - 180 = 0 \]
  Simplifying further, we get:
  \[ x^4 + 36x^3 + 1252x^2 + 1978x + 8910 = 0 \]
  To find the product of the real roots of this polynomial, we use the fact that the product of the roots of the polynomial \( ax^n + bx^{n-1} + \ldots + k \) is given by \( \frac{k}{a} \). For our polynomial, the product of the roots is:
  \[ \frac{8910}{1} = 8910 \]
  However, this result does not match the expected product of 20. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate our steps or assumptions.
