  To solve the equation \( x^2 + 18x + 30 = 2 \sqrt{x^2 + 18x + 45} \), we first square both sides to eliminate the square root:
  \[
  (x^2 + 18x + 30)^2 = 4 (x^2 + 18x + 45)
  \]
  Expanding both sides, we get:
  \[
  x^4 + 36x^3 + 108x^2 + 162x + 900 = 4x^2 + 72x + 180
  \]
  Rearranging terms, we obtain:
  \[
  x^4 + 36x^3 + 108x^2 + 162x + 900 - 4x^2 - 72x - 180 = 0
  \]
  Simplifying further:
  \[
  x^4 + 36x^3 + 104x^2 + 90x + 720 = 0
  \]
  We solve this polynomial equation using the method of successive substitutions or by inspection. Given the structure of the equation, we can infer that the roots are such that the product of the roots is 20.
