  To solve the problem, we need to find the product of the real roots of the equation \( x^2 + 18x + 30 = 2 \sqrt{x^2 + 18x + 45} \). We start by simplifying the equation and identifying the roots.
  1. **Simplify the equation**:
     \[
     x^2 + 18x + 30 = 2 \sqrt{x^2 + 18x + 45}
     \]
     Square both sides to eliminate the square root:
     \[
     (x^2 + 18x + 30)^2 = 4 (x^2 + 18x + 45)
     \]
     Expand both sides:
     \[
     x^4 + 36x^3 + 72x^2 + 54x + 900 = 4x^2 + 72x + 180
     \]
     Rearrange terms to form a polynomial equation:
     \[
     x^4 + 36x^3 + 72x^2 + 54x + 900 - 4x^2 - 72x - 180 = 0
     \]
     Simplify:
     \[
     x^4 + 36x^3 + 68x^2 - 12x + 720 = 0
     \]
  2. **Identify the roots**:
     The polynomial \( x^4 + 36x^3 + 68x^2 - 12x + 720 \) is a fourth-degree polynomial. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, we can infer that the roots are real and the product of the roots can be determined by the coefficients and the nature of the polynomial.
  3. **Calculate the product of the roots**:
     For a polynomial \( ax^n + bx^{n-1} + \ldots + k \), the product of the roots is given by \( \frac{k}{a} \). In this case, the coefficient \( k \) is 720 and the leading coefficient \( a \) is 1. Therefore, the product of the roots is:
     \[
     \frac{720}{1} = 720
     \]
  Thus, the product of the real roots of the given equation is \( 20 \).
