  To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given equation \( f(x) = x^2 + 18x + 30 - 2 \sqrt{x^2 + 18x + 45} \). We need to find the roots of this equation and then compute the product of these roots.
  1. **Simplify the equation**: We need to solve \( x^2 + 18x + 30 - 2 \sqrt{x^2 + 18x + 45} = 0 \).
  2. **Isolate the square root term**: The equation can be rewritten as \( x^2 + 18x + 30 = 2 \sqrt{x^2 + 18x + 45} \).
  3. **Square both sides to eliminate the square root**:
     \[
     (x^2 + 18x + 30)^2 = (2 \sqrt{x^2 + 18x + 45})^2
     \]
     Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:
     \[
     (x^2 + 18x + 30)^2 = 4 (x^2 + 18x + 45)
     \]
  4. **Expand and simplify**:
     \[
     x^4 + 36x^3 + 648x^2 + 1620x + 900 = 4x^2 + 72x + 180
     \]
     Rearrange to form a polynomial equation:
     \[
     x^4 + 36x^3 + 606x^2 + 1620x + 900 = 0
     \]
  5. **Solve the polynomial equation**: We need to find the roots of this polynomial. By inspection or using the Rational Root Theorem, we find that \( x = -3 \) and \( x = -5 \) are roots.
  6. **Verify the roots**: Substitute \( x = -3 \) and \( x = -5 \) back into the original equation to ensure they satisfy the equation.
  7. **Compute the product of the roots**: The product of the roots \( -3 \) and \( -5 \) is:
     \[
     (-3) \times (-5) = 15
     \]
  Thus, the product of the real roots of the equation is \( 15 \).
