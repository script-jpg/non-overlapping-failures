  To solve the equation \( x^2 + 18x + 30 = 2 \sqrt{x^2 + 18x + 45} \), we start by simplifying the equation. First, we square both sides to eliminate the square root:
  \[
  (x^2 + 18x + 30)^2 = (2 \sqrt{x^2 + 18x + 45})^2
  \]
  This simplifies to:
  \[
  x^4 + 36x^3 + 810x^2 + 36x + 900 = 4(x^2 + 18x + 45)
  \]
  Next, we expand and simplify the right-hand side:
  \[
  x^4 + 36x^3 + 810x^2 + 36x + 900 = 4x^2 + 72x + 180
  \]
  Rearranging terms, we get:
  \[
  x^4 + 36x^3 + 810x^2 + 36x + 900 - 4x^2 - 72x - 180 = 0
  \]
  Simplifying further:
  \[
  x^4 + 36x^3 + 770x^2 - 36x + 720 = 0
  \]
  We solve this polynomial equation by finding the roots. Given the structure of the problem, we know that the roots are symmetrically distributed around \( x = -9 \). By solving the polynomial, we find that the roots are \( x = -9, -1, -2, -3, -4 \). The product of these roots is:
  \[
  (-9) \times (-1) \times (-2) \times (-3) \times (-4) = 20
  \]
