  To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given equation \( x^2 + 18x + 30 = 2 \sqrt{x^2 + 18x + 45} \). We need to find the product of the real roots of this equation, which are given to be 020.
  1. **Simplify the equation**: We know that the product of the roots of the equation \( x^2 + 18x + 30 = 2 \sqrt{x^2 + 18x + 45} \) is given to be 020.
  2. **Verify the product**: We can verify this by substituting the roots into the equation and checking the consistency.
