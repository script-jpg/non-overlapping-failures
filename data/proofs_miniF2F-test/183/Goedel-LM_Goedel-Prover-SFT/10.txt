  To solve the problem, we need to find the product of the real roots of the equation \( x^2 + 18x + 30 = 2 \sqrt{x^2 + 18x + 45} \). We start by simplifying the equation and then solving for the roots.
  1. **Simplify the equation**:
     \[
     x^2 + 18x + 30 = 2 \sqrt{x^2 + 18x + 45}
     \]
     Square both sides to eliminate the square root:
     \[
     (x^2 + 18x + 30)^2 = (2 \sqrt{x^2 + 18x + 45})^2
     \]
     Simplify the right-hand side:
     \[
     (x^2 + 18x + 30)^2 = 4 (x^2 + 18x + 45)
     \]
     Expand both sides:
     \[
     x^4 + 36x^3 + 180x^2 + 360x + 900 = 4x^2 + 72x + 180
     \]
     Rearrange to form a polynomial equation:
     \[
     x^4 + 36x^3 + 180x^2 + 360x + 900 - 4x^2 - 72x - 180 = 0
     \]
     Simplify:
     \[
     x^4 + 36x^3 + 176x^2 + 288x + 720 = 0
     \]
  2. **Solve the polynomial equation**:
     We need to find the roots of the polynomial \( x^4 + 36x^3 + 176x^2 + 288x + 720 \). Given that the roots are real and the problem states that the product of the roots is 20, we can use this information to verify the solution.
