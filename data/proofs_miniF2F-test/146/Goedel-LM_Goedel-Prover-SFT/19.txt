  To determine the remainder of 1529 when divided by 6, we can use the property of modular arithmetic. Specifically, we need to compute \( 1529 \mod 6 \). This can be done by finding the quotient and the remainder of 1529 divided by 6.
  1. Compute the division of 1529 by 6:
     \[
     1529 \div 6 = 254 \text{ remainder } 5
     \]
     This is because:
     \[
     1529 = 254 \times 6 + 5
     \]
  2. Therefore, the remainder when 1529 is divided by 6 is 5.
