  To determine the remainder of 1529 when divided by 6, we can use the property of modular arithmetic. Specifically, we need to find \( 1529 \mod 6 \). By performing the division, we can see that:
  \[ 1529 \div 6 = 254 \text{ remainder } 5 \]
  This is because \( 1529 = 6 \times 254 + 5 \). Therefore, the remainder when 1529 is divided by 6 is 5.
  -/
  -- Use the `norm_num` tactic to compute the remainder of 1529 divided by 6.
