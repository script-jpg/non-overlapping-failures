  To determine the remainder of 1529 when divided by 6, we can use the property of modular arithmetic. Specifically, we need to show that \( 1529 \mod 6 = 5 \). This can be verified by performing the division and noting the remainder.
  -/
  -- Use the `norm_num` tactic to compute the remainder of 1529 when divided by 6.
  norm_num
  -- The `norm_num` tactic will simplify the expression and confirm that the remainder is 5.
  <;> simp [Nat.mod_eq_of_lt]
  -- The `simp` tactic with the lemma `Nat.mod_eq_of_lt` is used to simplify the expression further,
  -- ensuring that the result is in the correct form.
  <;> norm_num
  -- The `norm_num` tactic is used again to confirm the numerical result.
