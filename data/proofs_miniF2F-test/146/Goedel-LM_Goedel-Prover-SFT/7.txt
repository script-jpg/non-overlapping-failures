  To determine the remainder of 1529 when divided by 6, we can use the properties of modular arithmetic. Specifically, we can break down the number 1529 into a sum of multiples of 6 and a remainder.
  1. First, we note that 1529 can be expressed as a sum of multiples of 6 and a remainder.
  2. We calculate the sum of the multiples of 6 less than or equal to 1529:
     \[
     1529 \div 6 = 254 \text{ remainder } 5
     \]
     This is because:
     \[
     1529 = 6 \times 254 + 5
     \]
  3. Therefore, the remainder when 1529 is divided by 6 is 5.
