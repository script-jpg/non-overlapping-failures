  To determine the remainder of 1529 when divided by 6, we can use the property of modular arithmetic. Specifically, we need to find \( 1529 \mod 6 \). We can simplify this by performing the division and noting the remainder.
  First, we calculate the division of 1529 by 6:
  \[ 1529 \div 6 = 254 \text{ remainder } 5 \]
  This shows that:
  \[ 1529 = 6 \times 254 + 5 \]
  Thus, the remainder when 1529 is divided by 6 is 5.

  simp [Nat.mod_eq_of_lt (by norm_num : 1529 % 6 < 6)]
  -- The `simp` tactic simplifies the expression using known properties of modular arithmetic,
  -- confirming that the remainder is indeed 5.
