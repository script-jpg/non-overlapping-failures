  To determine the remainder of 1529 when divided by 6, we can use the property of modular arithmetic. Specifically, we need to find \( 1529 \mod 6 \). We can break down 1529 into a sum of multiples of 6 and a remainder. 
  First, we note that:
  \[ 1529 = 6 \times 254 + 5 \]
  This shows that when 1529 is divided by 6, the quotient is 254 and the remainder is 5. Therefore, we have:
  \[ 1529 \mod 6 = 5 \]

  -- Use the simplification tactic to directly compute the remainder of 1529 divided by 6.
  simp [Nat.mod_eq_of_lt, show 1529 < 6 * 255 by norm_num, show 1529 % 6 = 5 by norm_num]
  -- The `simp` tactic simplifies the expression using known properties of modular arithmetic and numerical computations.
  -- `Nat.mod_eq_of_lt` is used to assert that the remainder is less than the divisor, which is true since 1529 < 6 * 255.
  -- `norm_num` is used to perform numerical verification, ensuring that the calculations are correct.
