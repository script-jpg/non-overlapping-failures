  To determine the remainder of 1529 when divided by 6, we can use the property of modular arithmetic. Specifically, we need to show that \( 1529 \mod 6 = 5 \). This can be achieved by performing the division and finding the remainder.
  1. First, we perform the division of 1529 by 6. The quotient is 254 because \( 1529 \div 6 = 254 \) with a remainder.
  2. The remainder when 1529 is divided by 6 is 5. This is because \( 1529 = 6 \times 254 + 5 \).
  Thus, we have shown that \( 1529 \mod 6 = 5 \).
