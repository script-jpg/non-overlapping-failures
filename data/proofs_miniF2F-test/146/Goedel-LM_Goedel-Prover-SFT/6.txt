  To determine the remainder of 1529 when divided by 6, we can use modular arithmetic. Specifically, we need to show that \( 1529 \mod 6 = 5 \). This can be achieved by performing the division and noting the remainder.
  1. First, we compute the division of 1529 by 6.
  2. We find that the quotient is 254 and the remainder is 5.
  3. Therefore, \( 1529 = 6 \times 254 + 5 \).
  4. This confirms that the remainder is indeed 5.
