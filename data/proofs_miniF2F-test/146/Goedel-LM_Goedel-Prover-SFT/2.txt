  To determine the remainder of 1529 when divided by 6, we can use the property of modular arithmetic. Specifically, we need to compute \( 1529 \mod 6 \). We can simplify this by performing the division and finding the remainder.
  First, we perform the division of 1529 by 6:
  \[ 1529 \div 6 = 254 \text{ remainder } 5 \]
  This is because:
  \[ 1529 = 6 \times 254 + 5 \]
  Thus, the remainder when 1529 is divided by 6 is 5. Therefore, we have:
  \[ 1529 \mod 6 = 5 \]
