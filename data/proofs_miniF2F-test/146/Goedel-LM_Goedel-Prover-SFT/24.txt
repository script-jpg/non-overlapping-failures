  To determine the remainder of 1529 when divided by 6, we can use the property of modular arithmetic. Specifically, we need to show that \( 1529 \mod 6 = 5 \). This can be achieved by directly computing the remainder of 1529 divided by 6.

  -- Use the `norm_num` tactic to compute the remainder of 1529 divided by 6.
  norm_num
  -- The `norm_num` tactic will simplify the expression and directly compute the remainder, which is 5.
  -- Since the remainder is already computed and known to be 5, we can use `rfl` to confirm this.
