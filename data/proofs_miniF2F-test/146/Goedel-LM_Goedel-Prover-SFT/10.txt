  To determine the remainder of 1529 when divided by 6, we can use the property of modular arithmetic. Specifically, we need to find \( 1529 \mod 6 \). By performing the division, we find that:
  \[ 1529 \div 6 = 254 \text{ remainder } 5 \]
  Thus, the remainder when 1529 is divided by 6 is 5.

  simp [Nat.mod_eq_of_lt, show 1529 < 6 * 255 + 5 from by norm_num]
  -- The `norm_num` tactic will verify that 1529 is indeed less than 6 * 255 + 5,
  -- ensuring the correctness of the remainder calculation.
