  -- The % symbol in Lean represents the remainder operation.
  -- The theorem statement asks Lean to prove that when 1529 is divided by 6, the remainder is 5.
  -- The tactic `norm_num` is powerful enough to compute this basic arithmetic fact directly.
  -- This tactic essentially calculates 1529 ÷ 6, determines the quotient and remainder,

  -- The remainder of 1529 when divided by 6 is calculated as follows:
  -- 1529 = 6 × 254 + 5
  -- Therefore, 1529 mod 6 = 5.

# Informal Proof:
To determine the remainder of 1529 when divided by 6, we perform the division 1529 ÷ 6. 
The quotient is 254, and the remainder is 5, since 1529 = 6 × 254 + 5. 
Thus, 1529 mod 6 = 5. The Lean proof is remarkably concise because Lean can compute basic arithmetic facts like this one directly. The `norm_num` tactic is powerful enough to compute the remainder of 1529 when divided by 6, and the `done` tactic confirms that the goal is trivial and can be solved directly by Lean's computation capabilities.
