This is a straightforward number theory problem asking for the remainder when 1529 is divided by 6. The answer is 5, which is verified by the `norm_num` tactic in Lean 4. The calculation is based on the fact that 1529 divided by 6 gives a quotient of 254 and a remainder of 5, since 6 * 254 = 1524 and 1529 - 1524 = 5. The Lean proof is minimal because Lean's computational engine can directly compute this arithmetic expression.

In more detail, the division algorithm states that for any integer a and positive integer b, there exist unique integers q (quotient) and r (remainder) such that a = bq + r and 0 ≤ r < b. In this case, a = 1529 and b = 6. The Lean system is able to compute that 1529 = 6 * 254 + 5, where 0 ≤ 5 < 6, thus confirming that the remainder is indeed 5.

The Lean 4 proof demonstrates how even simple arithmetic facts can be formally verified in a proof assistant. While this particular problem is quite basic, it serves as a foundation for more complex mathematical reasoning. In Lean, the `norm_num` tactic is powerful for solving arithmetic goals, as it can compute expressions involving natural numbers, integers, rational numbers, and more. This tactic is particularly useful for goals involving concrete numerical values, as it can evaluate them directly to determine truth.

In summary, the Lean 4 proof of the remainder of 1529 when divided by 6 is remarkably concise because the calculation is direct and Lean's computational engine can handle it efficiently. The proof confirms that 1529 ≡ 5 (mod 6), which is the answer to the problem.
