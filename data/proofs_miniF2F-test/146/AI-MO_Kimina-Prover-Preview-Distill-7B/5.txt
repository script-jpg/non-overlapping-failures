```

The proof uses `Nat.mod_eq_of_lt` to rewrite the goal as `1529 = 6 * 254 + 5` and then uses `norm_num` to verify that this equation is true. The `linarith` tactic is used to prove that `6 * 254 < 1529`, which is true because `6 * 254 = 1524` and `1524 < 1529`.

The key insight is that when we divide 1529 by 6, we get a quotient of 254 and a remainder of 5. This means that 1529 = 6 * 254 + 5, and the remainder is 5. The Lean proof confirms this calculation by using the appropriate definitions and tactics to verify the equality.
