The `norm_num` tactic is powerful for arithmetic goals. It automatically computes the value of expressions involving concrete numbers and can solve goals involving linear arithmetic. In this case, it calculates 1529 mod 6 and verifies that it equals 5.

To understand why 1529 mod 6 equals 5, we can perform the division: 1529 divided by 6 is 254 with a remainder of 5, because 6 * 254 = 1524, and 1529 - 1524 = 5.

The complete proof is remarkably concise because Lean's automation is powerful for concrete arithmetic calculations. The `norm_num` tactic handles all the computation that we would otherwise need to do by hand, such as breaking down the division algorithm or computing the remainder directly.

In more detail, the division algorithm states that for any integers a and b (with b > 0), there exist unique integers q and r such that a = bq + r and 0 ≤ r < b. In our case, a = 1529, b = 6, q = 254, and r = 5. The `norm_num` tactic verifies that 1529 = 6 * 254 + 5 and that 0 ≤ 5 < 6, confirming that the remainder is indeed 5.
