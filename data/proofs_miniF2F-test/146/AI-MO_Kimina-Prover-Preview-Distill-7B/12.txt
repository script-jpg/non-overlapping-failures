The Lean proof is remarkably concise because Lean's computational engine is powerful enough to evaluate arithmetic expressions directly. When Lean encounters a goal that is purely computational, like proving that 1529 % 6 = 5, it can compute the value of 1529 modulo 6 directly. 

In Lean, the modulo operation is represented by the % symbol, which is the same as the mathematical modulo notation. Lean's computational engine will evaluate 1529 divided by 6, find the quotient is 254 with a remainder of 5, and thus conclude that 1529 % 6 = 5. This is exactly the mathematical reasoning we would use to solve this problem by hand.

Therefore, the complete Lean proof is just:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat

theorem mathd_numbertheory_551 : 1529 % 6 = 5 := by
  norm_num
```

The Lean proof is complete! The `norm_num` tactic is powerful enough to compute the value of 1529 modulo 6 directly, confirming that the remainder is indeed 5.
