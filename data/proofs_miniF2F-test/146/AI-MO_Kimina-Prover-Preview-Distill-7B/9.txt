-- Calculate the remainder of 1529 when divided by 6
  norm_num
```

The `norm_num` tactic is powerful enough to compute arithmetic expressions and verify equalities involving concrete numbers. In this case, it will compute that 1529 divided by 6 gives a quotient of 254 and a remainder of 5, thus proving that 1529 ≡ 5 (mod 6).

To understand why 1529 ≡ 5 (mod 6), we can also perform the division manually:
- 1529 ÷ 6 = 254 with remainder 5
- 254 × 6 = 1524
- 1529 - 1524 = 5

Therefore, 1529 ≡ 5 (mod 6), as 5 is the remainder when 1529 is divided by 6.
