-- 1529 = 6 * 254 + 5
  norm_num
```

The proof is straightforward: we need to show that 1529 divided by 6 leaves a remainder of 5. This can be directly verified by arithmetic division. 

When dividing 1529 by 6:
- 6 * 254 = 1524
- 1529 - 1524 = 5

So indeed, 1529 = 6 * 254 + 5, which means the remainder is 5.

In Lean 4, we can prove this using the `norm_num` tactic, which is powerful enough to compute arithmetic goals involving concrete numbers. The `norm_num` tactic will compute 1529 % 6 directly and verify that it equals 5.

Therefore, the complete formal proof is:

theorem mathd_numbertheory_551 : 1529 % 6 = 5 := by 
  norm_num
```

This theorem statement asserts that 1529 modulo 6 equals 5, and the proof is completed by the `norm_num` tactic, which calculates the modulus operation directly. The Lean system will compute 1529 divided by 6, find the quotient 254 and remainder 5, and verify that indeed 1529 % 6 = 5.
