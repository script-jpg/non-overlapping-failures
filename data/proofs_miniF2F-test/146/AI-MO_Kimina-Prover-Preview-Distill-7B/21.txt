-- Determine the remainder of 1529 (mod 6). Show that it is 5.
  norm_num
```

The Lean proof is remarkably concise because the problem is a straightforward computation. The `norm_num` tactic is powerful enough to compute the modulus operation directly. 

To verify manually: 
1529 divided by 6 is 254 with a remainder of 5, because 6 × 254 = 1524, and 1529 - 1524 = 5. Therefore, 1529 ≡ 5 (mod 6).

The Lean 4 proof is:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

These imports and settings provide the necessary mathematical library components and ensure that Lean can work with natural numbers and basic arithmetic operations.

Now, we can state the theorem:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_551 : 1529 % 6 = 5 := by
```

The theorem statement directly expresses the problem as the equality of the modulus operation to 5.

To complete the proof, we simply need to compute the modulus:

```tactics
norm_num
```

The `norm_num` tactic is sufficient to compute the modulus of 1529 with respect to 6. Lean's computational engine can evaluate this arithmetic expression directly, confirming that 1529 % 6 = 5.

Therefore, the complete Lean 4 proof is:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat

theorem mathd_numbertheory_551 : 1529 % 6 = 5 := by
  norm_num
```

This proof is complete and demonstrates how Lean can be used to verify simple arithmetic facts through computational verification.
