This Lean 4 code proves that the remainder of 1529 when divided by 6 is 5. The `norm_num` tactic is powerful for arithmetic goals. It computes the value of 1529 mod 6 directly. 

To understand why 1529 ≡ 5 (mod 6), we can perform the division: 
1529 ÷ 6 = 254 with remainder 5. 
Thus, 1529 = 6 * 254 + 5, 
which means 1529 ≡ 5 (mod 6).

The Lean proof is concise because the calculation is straightforward arithmetic. The `norm_num` tactic is able to compute the modulus operation directly, verifying that 1529 % 6 = 5. This is a great example of how Lean can handle simple arithmetic facts that would typically be taken as given in a more complex proof. In a formal Lean 4 proof, even simple arithmetic statements like this one need to be explicitly verified by the proof system, which is why we see the `norm_num` tactic being used to solve the goal.
