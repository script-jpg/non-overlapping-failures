-- 1529 divided by 6 is 130 with a remainder of 5.
  calc 1529 % 6 = 5 % 6 := by rfl
           _ = 5 := by simp

```

This proof is straightforward since Lean has built-in computation capabilities for arithmetic operations like modulo. The `calc` block allows us to show the computation steps explicitly:

1. `1529 % 6 = 5 % 6` by reflexivity (`rfl`), which means Lean verifies that both sides are definitionally equal
2. `5 % 6 = 5` using simplification (`simp`), which handles basic arithmetic facts

The key insight is that when computing `1529 % 6`, Lean can calculate the remainder directly. Since 1529 = 6 × 230 + 5, the remainder is 5. Lean's computational engine can perform this calculation automatically, which is why we can prove the equality so concisely.

In a more complex number theory problem, we might need to use properties of modular arithmetic or number theory theorems. For example, if we needed to prove something like Fermat's Little Theorem, we would use the appropriate number theory framework in Lean. But for this basic modulo calculation, Lean's computational capabilities handle it directly.
