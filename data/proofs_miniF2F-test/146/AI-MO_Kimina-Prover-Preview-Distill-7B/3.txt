-- The tactic `norm_num` automatically calculates the value of `1529 % 6` and proves it equals 5.

The `norm_num` tactic is powerful for solving arithmetic goals. It automatically computes the modulus operation and verifies that the result is indeed 5. This tactic is sufficient to prove the goal directly because the modulus operation is well-defined and can be evaluated computationally.

To understand why 1529 mod 6 = 5, we can perform the division: 1529 ÷ 6 = 254 with a remainder of 5. This means 1529 = 6 × 254 + 5, where 5 is the remainder. The remainder is always less than the divisor (6 in this case), so 5 is indeed the correct remainder.

The Lean proof is remarkably concise because the problem is a straightforward computational one. The `norm_num` tactic handles all the work that we would otherwise need to prove step by step using more primitive tactics. This demonstrates how Lean's automation can efficiently verify simple arithmetic facts that would be tedious to prove manually.
