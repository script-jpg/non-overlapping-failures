-- We use `norm_num`, which is a powerful tactic for solving arithmetic goals.

```

The `norm_num` tactic is particularly useful for goals involving concrete arithmetic computations. It automatically calculates that 1529 divided by 6 gives a quotient of 254 and a remainder of 5, thus proving that 1529 ≡ 5 (mod 6).

To understand why the remainder is 5, we can perform the division: 1529 ÷ 6 = 254 with remainder 5. This means 1529 = 6 × 254 + 5. The remainder 5 is the value that satisfies the condition 0 ≤ r < 6, where r is the remainder of 1529 when divided by 6.

Therefore, the remainder of 1529 when divided by 6 is indeed 5, which is our final answer.
