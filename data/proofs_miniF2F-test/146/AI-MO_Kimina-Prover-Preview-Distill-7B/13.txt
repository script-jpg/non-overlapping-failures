# Finding the Remainder of 1529 when Divided by 6

To determine the remainder of 1529 when divided by 6, we can perform a direct division. 

First, let's think about what we're trying to prove mathematically. We want to show that when 1529 is divided by 6, the remainder is 5. This can be expressed as:

1529 ≡ 5 (mod 6)

To verify this, we can check if 1529 = 6 * k + 5 for some integer k. Let's compute:

1529 ÷ 6 = 254.8333...

So, 1529 = 6 * 254 + r, where r is the remainder.

Calculating 6 * 254 = 1524

Therefore, r = 1529 - 1524 = 5

Thus, the remainder is indeed 5. Now let's translate this to Lean 4:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

We've imported the necessary libraries and opened namespaces. Now let's define the theorem:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_551 : 1529 % 6 = 5 := by
```

We have our theorem statement, which asserts that 1529 mod 6 equals 5. To prove this, we need to show that when 1529 is divided by 6, the remainder is 5.

To proceed with the proof, we can use Lean's computational capabilities. The modulo operation is computable, and Lean can verify this equality directly:

```tactics
norm_num
```

The `norm_num` tactic is powerful for solving arithmetic goals. It computes the value of arithmetic expressions and can verify equalities between concrete numbers. In this case, it computes 1529 % 6 and checks that it equals 5.

Let's reflect on why this is correct: 
1529 divided by 6 gives a quotient of 254 and a remainder of 5, because 1529 = 6 * 254 + 5. 
Therefore, 1529 mod 6 = 5.

The `norm_num` tactic handles this computation automatically, proving our theorem without requiring further steps.

So our complete proof is:

1. We imported the necessary libraries
2. Defined the theorem statement
3. Used `norm_num` to compute and verify that 1529 % 6 = 5

This is an example of a direct computational proof in Lean, where Lean's automation can verify arithmetic facts that would be tedious to prove by hand in a fully formal system.
