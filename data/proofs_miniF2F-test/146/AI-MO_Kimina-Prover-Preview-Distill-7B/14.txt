This formal proof confirms that the remainder when 1529 is divided by 6 is indeed 5, which is the final answer. The key insight was to express 1529 in the form of 6 * quotient + remainder, where the remainder is less than 6. We can verify this: 6 * 254 = 1524, and 1529 - 1524 = 5. Therefore, the remainder is 5.
