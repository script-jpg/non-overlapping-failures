-- The tactic `norm_num` automatically computes the value of `1529 % 6` and proves it is equal to 5.
  norm_num
```

This completes the proof that the remainder when 1529 is divided by 6 is 5.

To understand why this is true, we can perform the division: 
1529 ÷ 6 = 254 with a remainder of 5, since 6 × 254 = 1524, and 1529 - 1524 = 5.

Therefore, 1529 ≡ 5 (mod 6).
