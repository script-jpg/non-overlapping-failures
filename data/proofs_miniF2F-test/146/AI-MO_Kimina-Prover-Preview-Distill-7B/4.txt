# Finding the Remainder of 1529 when Dividing by 6

To determine the remainder when 1529 is divided by 6, we perform the division operation. The division of 1529 by 6 can be calculated as follows:

1. Divide 1529 by 6: 1529 ÷ 6 = 254 with a remainder.
2. Multiply 254 by 6: 254 × 6 = 1524.
3. Subtract this result from 1529: 1529 - 1524 = 5.

Thus, the remainder when 1529 is divided by 6 is 5. We can express this mathematically as 1529 ≡ 5 (mod 6).

The Lean proof will formalize this calculation:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

```

We begin by importing the necessary libraries and setting up the basic framework for our proof. The `maxHeartbeats` option is set to 0 to ensure Lean can verify the arithmetic calculation directly.

Now we'll define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_551 : 1529 % 6 = 5 := by
```

At this point, we have declared the theorem stating that the remainder of 1529 when divided by 6 is 5. This is a straightforward arithmetic fact that Lean's computation engine should be able to verify directly.

To complete the proof, we simply need to evaluate the expression 1529 % 6 and show it equals 5:

```tactics
norm_num
```

The `norm_num` tactic is powerful enough to compute arithmetic expressions and verify equalities involving concrete numbers. It will calculate 1529 modulo 6 and check that it indeed equals 5.

The full Lean proof is remarkably concise because Lean's computational capabilities can directly verify this arithmetic fact. The proof is essentially as follows:
- Lean computes 1529 divided by 6, which gives quotient 254 and remainder 5
- Lean verifies that 1529 = 6 * 254 + 5
- Lean confirms that the remainder is 5

Therefore, the complete formal proof is simply the statement of the theorem followed by the `norm_num` tactic, which Lean uses to verify the arithmetic calculation directly.
