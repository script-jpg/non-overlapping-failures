The Lean proof is remarkably concise because Lean's computational engine is powerful enough to evaluate arithmetic expressions directly. When given the goal `1529 % 6 = 5`, Lean's `norm_num` tactic is able to compute the modulus operation and verify that the equality holds.

To understand why 1529 mod 6 equals 5, we can perform the division: 1529 divided by 6 is 254 with a remainder of 5, since 6 * 254 = 1524, and 1529 - 1524 = 5. Therefore, the remainder when 1529 is divided by 6 is indeed 5.

The Lean proof is complete and demonstrates how Lean's computational capabilities can verify simple arithmetic facts efficiently. The beauty of formal verification is that even these basic calculations can be checked with absolute certainty, which is especially important in contexts where correctness is critical.
