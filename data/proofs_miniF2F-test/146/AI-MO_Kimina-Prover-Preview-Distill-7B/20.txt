    1529 % 6 = 1529 - 6 * (1529 / 6) := by definition of modulo

```

The Lean 4 proof of the number theory problem to determine the remainder of 1529 modulo 6 is as follows:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

```

We begin by importing the necessary libraries and opening namespaces for the mathematical tools we'll need. The `maxHeartbeats 0` setting allows Lean to work indefinitely on this problem, which is useful for complex calculations.

Now, let's state the theorem:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_551 : 1529 % 6 = 5 := by
```

We've declared the theorem. Now we need to prove it. The modulo operation calculates the remainder of 1529 divided by 6. Let's evaluate this step by step:

1. The modulo operation is defined as `a % b = a - b * (a / b)`.
2. For `1529 % 6`, we calculate `1529 / 6 = 254` (ignoring the remainder).
3. Then, `1529 % 6 = 1529 - 6 * 254`.
4. Calculating further: `6 * 254 = 1524`.
5. So, `1529 % 6 = 1529 - 1524 = 5`.

Let's complete the proof:

```tactics
norm_num
```

The `norm_num` tactic in Lean is powerful for arithmetic calculations. It automatically computes the numerical expression `1529 % 6` and verifies that it equals 5. This tactic handles all the intermediate steps of the calculation that we outlined above.

Therefore, we've successfully proven that the remainder when 1529 is divided by 6 is 5.
