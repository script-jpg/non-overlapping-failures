  Given the sum \(\sum_{k=1}^{35} \sin 5k = \tan \frac{m}{n}\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are relatively prime positive integers and \(\frac{m}{n} < 90\), we need to find \(m + n\). The proof involves verifying that the sum of the sine of the angles \(5k\) for \(k\) from 1 to 35 equals the given tangent value \(\tan \frac{m}{n}\). This is done by simplifying the sum using known trigonometric identities and properties.
