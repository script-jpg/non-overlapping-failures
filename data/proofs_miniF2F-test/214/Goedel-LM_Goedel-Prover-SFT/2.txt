  Given that \(\sum_{k=1}^{35} \sin 5k = \tan \frac{m}{n}\), where angles are measured in degrees, and \(m\) and \(n\) are relatively prime positive integers that satisfy \(\frac{m}{n} < 90\), we need to find \(m + n\) and show that it is 177.
  1. Start by simplifying the sum \(\sum_{k=1}^{35} \sin 5k\) using trigonometric identities.
  2. Recognize that \(\sin 5k\) can be expressed in terms of \(\sin k\) and \(\cos k\).
  3. Use the identity \(\sin 5k = 5 \sin k - 4 \sin^3 k\) to simplify the sum.
  4. Substitute the simplified expression into the given equation.
  5. Equate the simplified sum to \(\tan \frac{m}{n}\).
  6. Solve for \(m\) and \(n\) using the properties of trigonometric functions and the constraints given.
  7. Verify that \(m + n = 177\).
