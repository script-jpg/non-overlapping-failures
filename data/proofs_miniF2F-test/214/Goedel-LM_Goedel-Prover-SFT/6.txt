  Given that \(\sum_{k=1}^{35} \sin 5k = \tan \frac{m}{n}\), where angles are measured in degrees, and \(m\) and \(n\) are relatively prime positive integers that satisfy \(\frac{m}{n} < 90\), we need to find \(m + n\) and show that it is 177.
  1. Start by simplifying the given sum \(\sum_{k=1}^{35} \sin 5k\).
  2. Recognize that \(\sin 5k\) can be expressed in terms of \(\tan\) and \(\cot\) functions.
  3. Use the identity \(\tan \theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}\) and \(\cot \theta = \frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \theta}\) to transform the sum.
  4. Substitute the given value of \(\tan \frac{m}{n}\) into the transformed sum.
  5. Simplify the resulting expression to find the relationship between \(m\) and \(n\).
  6. Verify that \(m + n = 177\) by solving the resulting equations.
