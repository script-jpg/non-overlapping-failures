  Given that \(\sum_{k=1}^{35} \sin 5k = \tan \frac{m}{n}\), where angles are measured in degrees, and \(m\) and \(n\) are relatively prime positive integers that satisfy \(\frac{m}{n} < 90\), we need to find \(m + n\) and show that it is 177.
  1. Start by normalizing the given sum \(\sum_{k=1}^{35} \sin 5k = \tan \frac{m}{n}\).
  2. Use the properties of trigonometric functions and the fact that the sum of sines can be expressed in terms of tangent.
  3. Simplify the expression using numerical computations and algebraic manipulations.
  4. Verify that the simplified expression matches the given condition and derive the values of \(m\) and \(n\).
  5. Finally, check that \(m + n = 177\).
