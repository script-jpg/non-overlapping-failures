  Given the sum \(\sum_{k=1}^{35} \sin 5k = \tan \frac{m}{n}\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are relatively prime positive integers, and \(\frac{m}{n} < 90\), we need to find \(m + n\) and show that it equals 177.
  1. Start by simplifying the given sum \(\sum_{k=1}^{35} \sin 5k\) using trigonometric identities.
  2. Recognize that \(\sin 5k\) can be expressed in terms of \(\tan \frac{5k}{2}\).
  3. Substitute \(\tan \frac{5k}{2}\) into the sum and simplify using the properties of trigonometric functions.
  4. Equate the simplified sum to \(\tan \frac{m}{n}\) and solve for \(m\) and \(n\).
  5. Verify that \(m + n = 177\).
