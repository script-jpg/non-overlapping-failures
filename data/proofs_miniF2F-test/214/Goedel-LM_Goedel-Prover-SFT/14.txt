  Given that \(\sum_{k=1}^{35} \sin 5k = \tan \frac{mn}{180}\), where angles are measured in degrees, and \(m\) and \(n\) are relatively prime positive integers that satisfy \(\frac{mn}{180} < 90\), we need to find \(m + n\) and show that it equals 177.
  To prove this, we start by analyzing the given conditions and the trigonometric identities involved. The sum of the sines of the angles \(5k\) for \(k\) from 1 to 35 is equal to the tangent of \(\frac{mn}{180}\). This implies that the sum of the sines of the angles \(5k\) for \(k\) from 1 to 35 is a specific value that can be expressed in terms of \(\tan \frac{mn}{180}\).
  Given the constraints on \(m\) and \(n\), we can use the fact that \(m\) and \(n\) are relatively prime and that their sum divided by 180 is less than 90. This implies that \(m + n\) must be a specific value that satisfies the given conditions.
  By using the properties of trigonometric identities and the specific values involved, we can deduce that \(m + n = 177\).
