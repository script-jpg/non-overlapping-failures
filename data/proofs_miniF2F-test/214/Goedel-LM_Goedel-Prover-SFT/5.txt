  (h₀ : 0 < m)
  (h₁ : ∑ k in Finset.Icc (1 : ℕ) 35, Real.sin (5 * k * Real.pi / 180) = Real.tan (m * Real.pi / 180))
  (h₂ : (m.num : ℝ) / m.den < 90) :
  m.den + m.num = 177 := by

  Given that \(\sum_{k=1}^{35} \sin 5k = \tan \frac{mn}{180}\), where angles are measured in degrees, and \(m\) and \(n\) are relatively prime positive integers that satisfy \(\frac{mn}{180} < 90\), we need to find \(m + n\). We are to show that it is 177.
