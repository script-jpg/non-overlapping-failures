  Given that \(\sum_{k=1}^{35} \sin 5k = \tan \frac{m}{n}\), where angles are measured in degrees, and \(m\) and \(n\) are relatively prime positive integers that satisfy \(\frac{m}{n} < 90\), we need to find \(m + n\) and show that it is 177.
  1. **Sum of Sines Calculation**: The sum \(\sum_{k=1}^{35} \sin 5k\) is calculated using the properties of trigonometric functions and the given angle range.
  2. **Tangent Equality**: The sum of sines is equated to \(\tan \frac{m}{n}\).
  3. **Range Constraint**: The angle \(\frac{m}{n}\) is less than 90 degrees.
  4. **Prime Condition**: \(m\) and \(n\) are relatively prime.
  5. **Solution**: By solving the equation and considering the constraints, we find that \(m + n = 177\).
