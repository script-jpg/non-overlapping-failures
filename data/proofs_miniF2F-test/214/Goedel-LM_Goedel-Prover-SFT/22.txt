  Given that \(\sum_{k=1}^{35}\sin 5k = \tan \frac{m}{n}\), where angles are measured in degrees, and \(m\) and \(n\) are relatively prime positive integers that satisfy \(\frac{m}{n} < 90\), we need to find \(m + n\) and show that it is 177.
  1. Start by simplifying the given sum \(\sum_{k=1}^{35}\sin 5k\).
  2. Recognize that \(\sin 5k\) can be expressed in terms of \(\tan \frac{5k}{2}\).
  3. Use the identity \(\tan x = \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) to transform \(\sin 5k\) into \(\tan \frac{5k}{2}\).
  4. Combine the transformed terms to form a sum \(\sum_{k=1}^{35}\tan \frac{5k}{2}\).
  5. Use the known result \(\tan \frac{m}{n}\) for \(\tan \frac{m}{n}\) to equate the sum to \(\tan \frac{m}{n}\).
  6. Solve for \(m\) and \(n\) using the given conditions and properties of trigonometric functions.
  7. Verify that \(m + n = 177\).
