  Given that \(\sum_{k=1}^{35}\sin 5k = \tan \frac{m}{n}\), where angles are measured in degrees, and \(m\) and \(n\) are relatively prime positive integers that satisfy \(\frac{m}{n} < 90\), we need to find \(m + n\) and show that it equals 177.
  1. Start by simplifying the given sum \(\sum_{k=1}^{35}\sin 5k\).
  2. Recognize that \(\sin 5k\) can be expressed as \(\sin(5k)\).
  3. Use the properties of the sine function and the given angle range to simplify the sum.
  4. Substitute the simplified sum into the equation \(\sum_{k=1}^{35}\sin 5k = \tan \frac{m}{n}\).
  5. Use the properties of the tangent function and the given angle range to solve for \(\tan \frac{m}{n}\).
  6. Verify that \(m + n = 177\) by solving the resulting equations.
