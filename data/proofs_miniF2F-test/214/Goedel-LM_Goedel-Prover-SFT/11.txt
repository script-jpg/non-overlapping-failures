  Given that \(\sum_{k=1}^{35} \sin 5k = \tan \frac{m}{n}\), where angles are measured in degrees and \(m\) and \(n\) are relatively prime positive integers that satisfy \(\frac{m}{n} < 90\), we need to find \(m + n\) and show that it equals 177.
  1. **Sum of Sines Calculation**: The sum \(\sum_{k=1}^{35} \sin 5k\) can be expressed as a specific trigonometric value.
  2. **Tangent Equality**: Given that \(\tan \frac{m}{n} = \sum_{k=1}^{35} \sin 5k\), we equate the two expressions.
  3. **Range Constraint**: Since \(\frac{m}{n} < 90\), we have \(m < 90n\).
  4. **Coprimality and Sum**: Given that \(m\) and \(n\) are coprime, we can use the properties of trigonometric functions and the sum to derive the final result.
