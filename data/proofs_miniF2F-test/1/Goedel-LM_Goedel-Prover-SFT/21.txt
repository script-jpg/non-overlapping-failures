  We aim to show that there do not exist integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( 4x^3 - 7y^3 = 2003 \). To prove this, we will consider the equation modulo 7 and show that it leads to a contradiction.
  1. **Modulo 7 Analysis**: We analyze the equation \( 4x^3 - 7y^3 = 2003 \) modulo 7. Since \( 4x^3 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \) and \( 7y^3 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \), the equation simplifies to \( 1 \equiv 2003 \pmod{7} \).
  2. **Contradiction**: Since \( 2003 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \), we have \( 1 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \), which is a contradiction. Therefore, there are no integers \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy \( 4x^3 - 7y^3 = 2003 \).
