  To show that there are no integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( 4x^3 - 7y^3 = 2003 \), we proceed as follows:
  1. Assume for contradiction that there exist integers \( x \) and \( y \) satisfying the equation \( 4x^3 - 7y^3 = 2003 \).
  2. Consider the equation modulo 7. We analyze the possible values of \( x \) and \( y \) modulo 7 to see if the equation can hold.
  3. By examining the cubes of integers modulo 7, we find that \( 4x^3 - 7y^3 \) can only be congruent to 0, 1, or 6 modulo 7.
  4. However, 2003 modulo 7 is 4, which is a contradiction because \( 4x^3 - 7y^3 \) cannot be congruent to 4 modulo 7.
  5. Therefore, our assumption that there exist integers \( x \) and \( y \) satisfying \( 4x^3 - 7y^3 = 2003 \) must be false.
