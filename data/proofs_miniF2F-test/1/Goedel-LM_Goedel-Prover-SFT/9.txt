  We aim to show that there are no integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( 4x^3 - 7y^3 = 2003 \). The proof proceeds by contradiction. We assume the existence of integers \( x \) and \( y \) satisfying the equation and derive a contradiction using properties of modular arithmetic.
  1. Assume for contradiction that there exist integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( 4x^3 - 7y^3 = 2003 \).
  2. Consider the equation modulo 7. We compute the possible values of \( x^3 \) and \( y^3 \) modulo 7.
  3. By examining the cubes of integers modulo 7, we find that \( 4x^3 - 7y^3 \) can only take specific values modulo 7.
  4. However, 2003 modulo 7 is 3, which is not a possible value for \( 4x^3 - 7y^3 \) modulo 7.
  5. This contradiction implies that our assumption is false, and thus there are no integers \( x \) and \( y \) satisfying the equation \( 4x^3 - 7y^3 = 2003 \).
