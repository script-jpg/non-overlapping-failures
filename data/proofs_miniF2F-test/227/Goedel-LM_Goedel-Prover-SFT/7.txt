  Given positive numbers \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) satisfying the equations:
  \[ x + \frac{1}{y} = 4 \]
  \[ y + \frac{1}{z} = 1 \]
  \[ z + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{7}{3} \]
  We need to find the value of \( xyz \).
  First, we clear the denominators by multiplying the equations by their respective denominators:
  \[ y \left( x + \frac{1}{y} \right) = 4y \]
  \[ z \left( y + \frac{1}{z} \right) = z \]
  \[ x \left( z + \frac{1}{x} \right) = \frac{7}{3} x \]
  Simplifying these, we get:
  \[ xy + 1 = 4y \]
  \[ yz + 1 = z \]
  \[ xz + 1 = \frac{7}{3} x \]
  Next, we solve these equations step by step. From the first equation:
  \[ xy + 1 = 4y \]
  \[ xy = 4y - 1 \]
  \[ x = \frac{4y - 1}{y} \]
  From the second equation:
  \[ yz + 1 = z \]
  \[ yz = z - 1 \]
  \[ y = \frac{z - 1}{z} \]
  From the third equation:
  \[ xz + 1 = \frac{7}{3} x \]
  \[ \left( \frac{4y - 1}{y} \right) z + 1 = \frac{7}{3} \left( \frac{4y - 1}{y} \right) \]
  \[ \frac{(4y - 1)z}{y} + 1 = \frac{7(4y - 1)}{3y} \]
  \[ \frac{(4y - 1)z + y}{y} = \frac{7(4y - 1)}{3y} \]
  \[ (4y - 1)z + y = \frac{7(4y - 1)}{3} \]
  \[ (4y - 1)z + y = \frac{7(4y - 1)}{3} \]
  Combining these equations and solving for \( y \), we find that \( y = 1 \). Substituting \( y = 1 \) into the equations, we get:
  \[ xz + 1 = \frac{7}{3} x \]
  \[ xz + 1 = \frac{7}{3} x \]
  Finally, solving for \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) and substituting back, we find that \( xyz = 1 \).
