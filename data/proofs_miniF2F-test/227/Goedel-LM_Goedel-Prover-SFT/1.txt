  Given positive numbers \( x, y, \) and \( z \) satisfying the equations:
  \[ x + \frac{1}{y} = 4 \]
  \[ y + \frac{1}{z} = 1 \]
  \[ z + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{7}{3} \]
  We need to find the value of \( xyz \).
  First, we note that since \( x, y, \) and \( z \) are positive, we can use field simplification to manipulate the given equations. We will use algebraic manipulation and linear arithmetic to derive the desired result.
