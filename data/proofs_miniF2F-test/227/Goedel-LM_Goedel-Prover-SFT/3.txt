  Given positive numbers \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) satisfying the equations:
  \[ x + \frac{1}{y} = 4 \]
  \[ y + \frac{1}{z} = 1 \]
  \[ z + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{7}{3} \]
  We need to find the value of \( xyz \).
  First, we note that since \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) are positive, we can use the given equations to derive the value of \( xyz \). We will use algebraic manipulations and inequalities to show that \( xyz = 1 \).
