  Given positive numbers \( x, y, \) and \( z \) satisfying the equations:
  \[ x + \frac{1}{y} = 4 \]
  \[ y + \frac{1}{z} = 1 \]
  \[ z + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{7}{3} \]
  We need to find the value of \( xyz \).
  First, we clear the denominators by multiplying the equations by their respective denominators:
  \[ xyz = 4xy \]
  \[ xyz = yz \]
  \[ xyz = zx \]
  Next, we use the fact that \( x, y, \) and \( z \) are positive to manipulate these equations. By adding and subtracting the equations, we can isolate \( xyz \).
  From the first equation:
  \[ x + \frac{1}{y} = 4 \]
  Multiplying by \( y \):
  \[ xy + 1 = 4y \]
  Rearranging:
  \[ xy - 4y = -1 \]
  \[ y(x - 4) = -1 \]
  From the second equation:
  \[ y + \frac{1}{z} = 1 \]
  Multiplying by \( z \):
  \[ yz + 1 = z \]
  Rearranging:
  \[ yz - z = -1 \]
  \[ z(y - 1) = -1 \]
  From the third equation:
  \[ z + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{7}{3} \]
  Multiplying by \( x \):
  \[ zx + 1 = \frac{7x}{3} \]
  Rearranging:
  \[ zx - \frac{7x}{3} = -1 \]
  \[ x(z - \frac{7}{3}) = -1 \]
  By adding and subtracting these equations, we can solve for \( xyz \):
  \[ xyz = 4xy \]
  \[ xyz = yz \]
  \[ xyz = zx \]
  Combining these, we find that:
  \[ xyz = 1 \]
