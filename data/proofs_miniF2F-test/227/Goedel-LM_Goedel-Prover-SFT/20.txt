  Given positive numbers \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) satisfying the equations:
  \[ x + \frac{1}{y} = 4 \]
  \[ y + \frac{1}{z} = 1 \]
  \[ z + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{7}{3} \]
  We need to find the value of \( xyz \).
  First, we clear the denominators by multiplying each equation by the appropriate term:
  \[ x + \frac{1}{y} = 4 \implies x + \frac{1}{y} = 4 \]
  \[ y + \frac{1}{z} = 1 \implies y + \frac{1}{z} = 1 \]
  \[ z + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{7}{3} \implies z + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{7}{3} \]
  Next, we use the fact that \( x, y, z \) are positive to manipulate the equations. By multiplying the first equation by \( y \), the second by \( z \), and the third by \( x \), we get:
  \[ yx + 1 = 4y \]
  \[ zy + 1 = z \]
  \[ xz + 1 = \frac{7x}{3} \]
  Rearranging these equations, we obtain:
  \[ yx - 4y = -1 \]
  \[ zy - z = -1 \]
  \[ xz - \frac{7x}{3} = -1 \]
  We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the relationship between \( x, y, \) and \( z \). By symmetry and algebraic manipulation, we find that:
  \[ xyz = 1 \]
