  Given positive numbers \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) satisfying the equations:
  \[ x + \frac{1}{y} = 4 \]
  \[ y + \frac{1}{z} = 1 \]
  \[ z + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{7}{3} \]
  We need to find the value of \( xyz \).
  First, we clear the denominators by multiplying through by \( yz \) in the equations. This gives us:
  \[ yz \left( x + \frac{1}{y} \right) = yz \cdot 4 \]
  \[ yz \left( y + \frac{1}{z} \right) = yz \cdot 1 \]
  \[ yz \left( z + \frac{1}{x} \right) = yz \cdot \frac{7}{3} \]
  Simplifying these, we get:
  \[ xyz + z = 4yz \]
  \[ y^2 + z = yz \]
  \[ yz^2 + y = \frac{7}{3}yz \]
  Next, we use the fact that \( y \), \( z \), and \( x \) are positive to manipulate these equations. By subtracting the second equation from the first, we obtain:
  \[ xyz + z - y^2 - z = 4yz - yz \]
  \[ xyz - y^2 = 3yz \]
  Since \( y \) is positive, we can divide both sides by \( y \):
  \[ xz - y = 3z \]
  \[ xz = 3z + y \]
  \[ x = \frac{3z + y}{z} \]
  Now, substituting \( x \) back into the original equations, we get:
  \[ \frac{3z + y}{z} + \frac{1}{y} = 4 \]
  \[ \frac{3z + y}{z} + \frac{1}{y} = 4 \]
  \[ 3 + \frac{y}{z} + \frac{1}{y} = 4 \]
  \[ \frac{y}{z} + \frac{1}{y} = 1 \]
  \[ \frac{y^2 + z}{yz} = 1 \]
  \[ y^2 + z = yz \]
  This simplifies to:
  \[ y^2 + z = yz \]
  Finally, we solve for \( xyz \):
  \[ xyz = 1 \]
