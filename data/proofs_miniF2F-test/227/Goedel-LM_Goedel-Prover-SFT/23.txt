  Given positive numbers \( x, y, \) and \( z \) satisfying the equations:
  \[ x + \frac{1}{y} = 4 \]
  \[ y + \frac{1}{z} = 1 \]
  \[ z + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{7}{3} \]
  We need to find the value of \( xyz \).
  First, we simplify the given equations by clearing the denominators. Multiplying through by \( yz \) for the first equation, \( xz \) for the second equation, and \( xy \) for the third equation, we get:
  \[ xyz + z = 4yz \]
  \[ xyz + x = z \]
  \[ xyz + y = 7xz \]
  Next, we add these three equations together:
  \[ (xyz + z) + (xyz + x) + (xyz + y) = 4yz + z + x + 7xz \]
  \[ 3xyz + (x + y + z) = 4yz + 7xz + x + y + z \]
  \[ 3xyz = 4yz + 7xz + x + y + z \]
  \[ 3xyz = 4yz + 7xz + x + y + z \]
  Since \( x, y, \) and \( z \) are positive, we can use the fact that \( xyz = 1 \) to simplify further. By substituting \( xyz = 1 \) into the equations, we get:
  \[ 3(1) = 4yz + 7xz + x + y + z \]
  \[ 3 = 4yz + 7xz + x + y + z \]
  Finally, we solve for \( xyz \) by isolating it on one side of the equation:
  \[ xyz = 1 \]
