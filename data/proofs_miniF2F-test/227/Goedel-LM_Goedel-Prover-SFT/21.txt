  Given positive numbers \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) satisfying the equations:
  \[ x + \frac{1}{y} = 4 \]
  \[ y + \frac{1}{z} = 1 \]
  \[ z + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{7}{3} \]
  We need to determine the value of \( xyz \).
  First, we clear the denominators by multiplying each equation by the appropriate terms to eliminate the fractions. Then, we simplify and solve the resulting system of equations to find the values of \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \). Finally, we verify that the product \( xyz \) equals 1.
