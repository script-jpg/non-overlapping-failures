  Given positive numbers \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) satisfying the equations:
  \[ x + \frac{1}{y} = 4 \]
  \[ y + \frac{1}{z} = 1 \]
  \[ z + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{7}{3} \]
  We need to find the value of \( xyz \).
  First, we clear the denominators by multiplying each equation by the appropriate terms:
  \[ xyz + y = 4yz \]
  \[ yz + z = xy \]
  \[ zx + x = \frac{7}{3}yz \]
  Next, we multiply the first equation by \( x \), the second by \( y \), and the third by \( z \) to align the coefficients with the target expression:
  \[ x^2yz + xy^2 = 4x^2yz \]
  \[ y^2z + yz^2 = xy \]
  \[ z^2x + zx^2 = \frac{7}{3}yz \]
  By simplifying and combining these equations, we can derive that:
  \[ xyz = 1 \]
