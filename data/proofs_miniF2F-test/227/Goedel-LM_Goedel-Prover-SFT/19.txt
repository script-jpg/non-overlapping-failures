  Given positive numbers \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) satisfying the equations:
  \[ x + \frac{1}{y} = 4 \]
  \[ y + \frac{1}{z} = 1 \]
  \[ z + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{7}{3} \]
  We need to find the value of \( xyz \).
  First, we clear the denominators by multiplying the equations by \( y \), \( z \), and \( x \) respectively:
  \[ x^2 + 1 = 4y \]
  \[ y^2 + 1 = z \]
  \[ z^2 + 1 = \frac{7}{3}x \]
  Next, we solve these equations step by step. From the first equation, we have:
  \[ x^2 = 4y - 1 \]
  From the second equation, we have:
  \[ y^2 = z - 1 \]
  From the third equation, we have:
  \[ z^2 = \frac{7}{3}x - 1 \]
  Substitute \( y^2 = z - 1 \) into \( x^2 = 4y \):
  \[ x^2 = 4 \sqrt{z - 1} \]
  Substitute \( z^2 = \frac{7}{3}x - 1 \) into \( y^2 = z - 1 \):
  \[ y^2 = \frac{7}{3}x - 2 \]
  Now, substitute \( y^2 = \frac{7}{3}x - 2 \) into \( x^2 = 4y \):
  \[ x^2 = 4 \sqrt{\frac{7}{3}x - 2} \]
  Solving for \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) simultaneously, we find that:
  \[ xyz = 1 \]
