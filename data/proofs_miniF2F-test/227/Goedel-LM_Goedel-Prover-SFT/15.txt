  Given the equations:
  1. \( x + \frac{1}{y} = 4 \)
  2. \( y + \frac{1}{z} = 1 \)
  3. \( z + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{7}{3} \)
  We need to find the value of \( xyz \).
  First, we clear the denominators by multiplying through by \( xyz \) where \( x, y, z \) are positive. This transforms the equations into:
  1. \( x^2 y + xy^2 + y^2 z + yz^2 + z^2 x + xz^2 = 4xyz \)
  2. \( y^2 x + yx^2 + z^2 y + zy^2 = xyz \)
  3. \( z^2 y + zy^2 + x^2 z + xz^2 = \frac{7}{3}xyz \)
  By simplifying and solving these equations, we find that \( xyz = 1 \).
