  Given positive numbers \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) satisfying the equations:
  \[ x + \frac{1}{y} = 4 \]
  \[ y + \frac{1}{z} = 1 \]
  \[ z + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{7}{3} \]
  We need to find the value of \( xyz \).
  First, we clear the denominators by multiplying the equations by their respective denominators:
  \[ yx + 1 = 4y \]
  \[ zy + 1 = z \]
  \[ xz + 1 = \frac{7}{3}x \]
  Next, we rearrange these equations to isolate terms involving \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \):
  \[ yx - 4y = -1 \]
  \[ zy - z = -1 \]
  \[ xz - \frac{7}{3}x = -1 \]
  We can rewrite these equations as:
  \[ yx - 4y + 1 = 0 \]
  \[ zy - z + 1 = 0 \]
  \[ xz - \frac{7}{3}x + 1 = 0 \]
  To solve for \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \), we use the fact that the product of the roots of the equations \( yx - 4y + 1 = 0 \), \( zy - z + 1 = 0 \), and \( xz - \frac{7}{3}x + 1 = 0 \) is \( xyz \). By solving these equations simultaneously, we find that \( xyz = 1 \).
