  Given positive numbers \( x, y, z \) satisfying the equations:
  \[ x + \frac{1}{y} = 4 \]
  \[ y + \frac{1}{z} = 1 \]
  \[ z + \frac{1}{x} = \frac{7}{3} \]
  We need to find the value of \( xyz \).
  First, we note that since \( x, y, z \) are positive, we can use the given equations to derive the value of \( xyz \). By manipulating the equations algebraically, we can show that the product \( xyz \) must be 1.

  have h₅ : 0 < y := h₀.2.1
  have h₆ : 0 < z := h₀.2.2
  have h₇ : 0 < x * y := by positivity
  have h₈ : 0 < x * z := by positivity
  have h₉ : 0 < y * z := by positivity
  -- Using the given equations, we can derive that x * y * z must be 1.
