-- Find $9^{-1} \pmod{100}$, as a residue modulo 100.  (Give an answer between 0 and 99, inclusive.) Show that it is 89.

  -- The above problem is equivalent to solve the equation $9x \equiv 1 \pmod{100}$.
  -- Since 9 and 100 are coprime, then given equation has one solution.
  -- In order to obtain the solution, we can use `decide` to find it, since it is a multiple of 100.
