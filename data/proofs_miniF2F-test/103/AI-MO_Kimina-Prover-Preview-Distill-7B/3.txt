-- We start by observing that finding $9^{-1} \pmod{100}$ is equivalent to finding a value $x$ such that $9x \equiv 1 \pmod{100}$.
  -- This means $9x = 1 + 100k$ for some integer $k$, or rearranged: $9x - 100k = 1$.
  have h₂ : x * 9 % 100 = 1 := h₁

  -- Since $\gcd(9, 100) = 1$, we know that 9 has an inverse modulo 100. This is because the inverse of a number $a$ modulo $m$ exists if and only if $\gcd(a, m) = 1$.
  have h₃ : x * 9 ≡ 1 [MOD 100] := by
    exact h₁

  -- To solve $9x \equiv 1 \pmod{100}$, we can test values or use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find that $x \equiv 89 \pmod{100}$.
  -- Let's verify: $9 \cdot 89 = 801$, and $801 \div 100 = 8$ with remainder $1$. So indeed $9 \cdot 89 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}$.
  have h₄ : x = 89 := by
    omega

  -- The omega tactic is powerful for solving integer arithmetic goals. It can deduce that if $x \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}$ and $0 \leq x < 100$, then $x = 89$.
