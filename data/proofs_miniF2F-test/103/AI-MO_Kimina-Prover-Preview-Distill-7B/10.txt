--Find $9^{-1} \pmod{100}$, as a residue modulo 100.  (Give an answer between 0 and 99, inclusive.) Show that it is 89.

  --The question is equivalent to : find x s.t. x*9 ≡ 1 (mod 100), or x*9 = 1+100k for some integer k.

  --We solve this problem by finding appropriate values for k.

  --We know that x*9 = 1+100k. So x*9-1 = 100k. That is 9x-1 divisible by 100.

  --We try some special values of k to find appropriate x.

  --When k=4, 100*4=400, 400+1=401 is not divisible by 9.

  --When k=3, 100*3=300, 300+1=301 is not divisible by 9.

  --When k=2, 100*2=200, 200+1=201 is not divisible by 9.

  --When k=1, 100*1=100, 100+1=101 is not divisible by 9.

  --When k=0, 100*0=0, 0+1=1 is not divisible by 9.

  --When k=-1, 100*(-1)=-100, -100+1=-99 is divisible by 9.

  --So x*9 = -99, x = -11. And we find that x = 89.
