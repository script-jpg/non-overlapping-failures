-- `x * 9 % 100 = 1` implies that the last two digits of $9x$ is equal to $01$. As $x$ is a positive integer less than $100$, we can directly check that $x = 89$ is the only solution.

The Lean 4 proof is remarkably concise because Lean's automation is powerful enough to solve arithmetic problems like this directly. Let me explain why the answer is 89 and how Lean proves it.

To find $9^{-1} \pmod{100}$, we need to find an integer $x$ such that $9x \equiv 1 \pmod{100}$. This means $9x - 100y = 1$ for some integer $y$. 

Let's solve this using the extended Euclidean algorithm:

1. $100 = 11 \cdot 9 + 1$
2. $9 = 9 \cdot 1 + 0$

From the first step, we have $1 = 100 - 11 \cdot 9$. Therefore, $-11 \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}$, which means $x \equiv -11 \pmod{100}$. Since we want $x$ to be in the range $[0, 99]$, the solution is $x = 100 - 11 = 89$.

Now, let's prove this is the only solution. Suppose there is another $x'$ such that $x' \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}$. Then $x' \cdot 9 - x \cdot 9 = 9(x' - x) \equiv 0 \pmod{100}$. Since $\gcd(9, 100) = 1$, this implies $x' - x \equiv 0 \pmod{100}$, so $x' \equiv x \pmod{100}$. Since both $x$ and $x'$ are in $[0, 99]$, they must be equal.

In Lean, we can prove this as follows:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

We start by importing the necessary libraries and setting up the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_34 (x : ℕ) (h₀ : x < 100) (h₁ : x * 9 % 100 = 1) : x = 89 := by 
```

Now we need to prove that the only x < 100 satisfying x * 9 % 100 = 1 is x = 89. We'll do this by checking all possible values directly:

```tactics
have h₂ : x = 89 := by omega
exact h₂
```

The Lean tactic `omega` is powerful for solving arithmetic goals. It's able to deduce that the only x < 100 satisfying x * 9 % 100 = 1 is x = 89. This is because it can check all possible values (since x < 100) and verify that only 89 satisfies the congruence.

Therefore, the modular inverse of 9 modulo 100 is 89, and it's the unique solution in the range [0, 99].
