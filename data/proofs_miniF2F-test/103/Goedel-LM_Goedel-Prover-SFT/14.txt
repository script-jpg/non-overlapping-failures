  To solve for \(9^{-1} \pmod{100}\), we need to find a number \(x\) such that \(x \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\). Given that \(x \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\), we can use the properties of modular arithmetic to solve for \(x\). Specifically, we know that \(x \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\). We can use the fact that \(9 \cdot 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\) to find \(x\). By testing values, we find that \(x = 89\) satisfies the condition.

  -- We start by noting the given condition.
  have h₁' := h₁
  -- We use the fact that 9 * 8 % 100 = 1 to find x.
  have h₁ : 9 * 8 % 100 = 1 := by norm_num
  -- We test values of x to find the solution.
  have h₂ : x = 89 := by
    -- We use interval_cases to test each possible value of x.
    interval_cases x <;> norm_num at h₁' <;> omega
  -- We conclude that x = 89 is the solution.
