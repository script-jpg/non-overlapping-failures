  To find \(9^{-1} \pmod{100}\), we need to find a number \(x\) such that \(x \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\). Given that \(x < 100\) and \(x \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\), we can use the fact that \(9\) and \(100\) are coprime. By Euler's theorem, since \(\phi(100) = 40\), we have:
  \[
  9^{40} \equiv 1 \pmod{100}
  \]
  However, we only need \(x \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\). Since \(9 \cdot 9 = 81\), we can reduce the exponent modulo \(40\):
  \[
  81 \equiv 1 \pmod{40}
  \]
  Thus, \(x = 81\) satisfies the condition. However, since \(x < 100\), we conclude that \(x = 89\).

    -- Use the fact that 9 and 100 are coprime to find the modular inverse.
    -- By Euler's theorem, since φ(100) = 40, we have 9^40 ≡ 1 (mod 100).
    -- However, we only need x * 9 ≡ 1 (mod 100).
    -- Since 9 * 9 = 81, we can reduce the exponent modulo 40: 81 ≡ 1 (mod 40).
    -- Thus, x = 81 satisfies the condition.
    -- However, since x < 100, we conclude that x = 89.
    have : x = 89 := by
      -- Use the fact that 9 * 9 = 81 and 81 % 100 = 1 to find x.
