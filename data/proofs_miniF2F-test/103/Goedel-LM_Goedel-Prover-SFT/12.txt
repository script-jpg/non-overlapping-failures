  To solve for \( x \) in the congruence \( x \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100} \) and show that \( x = 89 \), we proceed as follows:
  1. Start by rewriting the congruence \( x \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100} \) in a form that isolates \( x \).
  2. Use the fact that \( 9 \) and \( 100 \) are coprime to find an integer \( k \) such that \( x = 9k \mod 100 \).
  3. Given the constraint \( x < 100 \), solve for \( k \) by checking the congruence \( 9k \equiv 1 \pmod{100} \).
  4. Verify that \( k = 89 \) satisfies the congruence, leading to \( x = 89 \).
