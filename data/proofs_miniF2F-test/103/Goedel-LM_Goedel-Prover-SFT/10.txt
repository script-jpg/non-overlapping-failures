  To solve for \(9^{-1} \pmod{100}\), we need to find an integer \(x\) such that \(x \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\). Given the conditions \(x < 100\) and \(x \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\), we can use the properties of modular arithmetic to find \(x\). Specifically, we can use the fact that \(x \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\) implies \(x \equiv 89 \pmod{100}\). This is because \(89 \cdot 9 = 702 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\). Therefore, \(x = 89\) is the solution.

  -- Since \(1 \cdot 9 = 9\), we have \(x \cdot 81 \equiv 9 \pmod{100}\).
  -- Given \(x < 100\), we need to find \(x\) such that \(x \cdot 81 \equiv 9 \pmod{100}\).
  -- We know \(89 \cdot 81 = 7029 \equiv 9 \pmod{100}\), so \(x = 89\).
