  To find \(9^{-1} \pmod{100}\), we need to determine a number \(x\) such that \(x \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\). We are given that \(x < 100\) and \(x \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\). We need to show that \(x = 89\).
  First, we use the fact that \(x \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\). This implies that \(x \cdot 9 = 1 + 100k\) for some integer \(k\). We need to find \(x\) such that \(x < 100\).
  We solve the congruence \(x \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\). To do this, we find the modular inverse of 9 modulo 100. The inverse of 9 modulo 100 is 89 because \(9 \cdot 89 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\).
  Thus, we have \(x \equiv 89 \pmod{100}\). Since \(x < 100\), the only possible value for \(x\) is 89.

  -- We know that x * 9 % 100 = 1 from the given hypothesis.
  have h₁ : x * 9 % 100 = 1 := h₁
  -- We use the fact that 89 is the modular inverse of 9 modulo 100.
  have h₂ : x = 89 := by
    -- We use interval_cases to check each possible value of x less than 100.
    interval_cases x <;> simp_all [Nat.mul_mod]
    -- Only 89 satisfies the condition x * 9 % 100 = 1.
