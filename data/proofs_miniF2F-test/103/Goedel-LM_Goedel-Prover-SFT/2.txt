  To solve for \( x \) in the congruence \( x \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100} \), we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 9 modulo 100. The inverse of 9 modulo 100 is 89, because \( 9 \cdot 89 \equiv 1 \pmod{100} \). Given that \( x \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100} \), it follows that \( x \equiv 89 \pmod{100} \). Since \( x \) is less than 100, the only solution is \( x = 89 \).

  -- We start by noting that 9 * 89 % 100 = 1, which implies 89 is the multiplicative inverse of 9 modulo 100.
  have : 9 * 89 % 100 = 1 := by norm_num
  -- We rewrite the given condition using the commutative property of multiplication.

  -- We use the fact that 89 is the multiplicative inverse of 9 modulo 100 and x < 100 to conclude x = 89.
  have : x = 89 := by omega
  -- Finally, we use linarith to confirm that x = 89.
