  To solve for \(9^{-1} \pmod{100}\), we need to find an integer \(x\) such that \(x \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\). We will show that \(x = 89\) satisfies this condition.
  1. Start by expressing the congruence \(x \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\).
  2. Use the fact that \(9 \cdot 89 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\) to verify that \(x = 89\) is indeed the solution.
  3. Simplify the congruence to confirm the uniqueness of the solution modulo 100.
