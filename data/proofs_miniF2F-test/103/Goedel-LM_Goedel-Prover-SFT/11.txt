  To find \(9^{-1} \pmod{100}\), we need to solve the congruence \(9x \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\). Given that \(x\) is a natural number less than 100 and satisfies \(9x \mod 100 = 1\), we can use the properties of modular arithmetic to derive the value of \(x\).
  1. Start by expressing the congruence \(9x \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\).
  2. Use the fact that \(x < 100\) to ensure \(x\) is a valid residue modulo 100.
  3. Simplify the congruence using properties of modular arithmetic to find \(x\).
  Given the congruence \(9x \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\), we can solve for \(x\) by finding the modular inverse of 9 modulo 100. The modular inverse of 9 modulo 100 is 89, because \(9 \times 89 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\). Therefore, the value of \(x\) that satisfies the given congruence is 89.
