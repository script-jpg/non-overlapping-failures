  To find \(9^{-1} \pmod{100}\), we need to solve the congruence \(9x \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\). Given that \(x\) is a natural number less than 100 and \(x \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\), we can use the properties of modular arithmetic to show that \(x \equiv 89 \pmod{100}\).
  1. Start by noting that \(x \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\).
  2. This implies that \(x \cdot 9\) is congruent to 1 modulo 100.
  3. To solve for \(x\), we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 9 modulo 100.
  4. The inverse of 9 modulo 100 is 89 because \(9 \cdot 89 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\).
  5. Therefore, \(x \equiv 89 \pmod{100}\).
