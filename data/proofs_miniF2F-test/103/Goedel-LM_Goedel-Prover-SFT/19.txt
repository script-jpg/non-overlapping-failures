  To find \(9^{-1} \pmod{100}\), we need to solve the congruence \(9x \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\). Given that \(x\) is a natural number less than 100, we can use the properties of modular arithmetic to find the solution. Specifically, we will show that \(x = 89\) satisfies this congruence.
  1. Start with the given congruence \(9x \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\).
  2. We need to find \(x\) such that \(9x \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\).
  3. By the properties of modular arithmetic, we can test values of \(x\) to find a solution.
  4. Testing \(x = 89\), we get \(9 \times 89 = 801\), and \(801 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\).
  5. Therefore, \(x = 89\) is a solution to the congruence \(9x \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\).

  -- We start by assuming that x is a natural number less than 100.
  have : x < 100 := by assumption
  -- We also assume that x * 9 % 100 = 1, which means x * 9 ≡ 1 (mod 100).
  have : x * 9 % 100 = 1 := by assumption
  -- We need to show that x = 89.
  have : x = 89 := by
    -- We use the fact that x * 9 % 100 = 1 to solve for x.
    -- By testing values of x, we find that x = 89 satisfies the congruence.
    omega
  -- Finally, we conclude that x = 89.
