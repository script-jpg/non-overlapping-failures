  To find \(9^{-1} \pmod{100}\), we need to show that there exists an integer \(x\) such that \(x \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\). Given that \(x\) is a natural number less than 100 and \(x \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\), we can use the properties of modular arithmetic to solve for \(x\).
  First, we note that \(x \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\) implies that \(x\) must be a multiple of 9 plus a remainder when divided by 100. We need to find such an \(x\) that is less than 100.
  By testing values, we find that \(x = 89\) satisfies the condition because \(89 \cdot 9 = 791\) and \(791 \mod 100 = 1\).

  -- We know that x is less than 100.
  have h : x < 100 := by linarith
  -- We also know that x * 9 % 100 = 1.
  have h₂ : x * 9 % 100 = 1 := by simpa using h₁
  -- Using the properties of modular arithmetic, we can deduce that x must be 89.
  have h₃ : x = 89 := by
    -- We use interval_cases to test possible values of x.
    interval_cases x <;> norm_num at h₂ ⊢
  -- Finally, we conclude that x = 89.
