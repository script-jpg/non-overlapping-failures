  To find \(9^{-1} \pmod{100}\), we need to find a number \(x\) such that \(x \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\). We are given that \(x < 100\) and \(x \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\). We will show that \(x = 89\).
  1. Start by rewriting the congruence condition \(x \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\) in terms of the modulus operation.
  2. Use the fact that \(x < 100\) to ensure \(x\) is a valid residue modulo 100.
  3. Use the `omega` tactic to solve the resulting linear congruence and verify that \(x = 89\).
