  To solve for \(9^{-1} \pmod{100}\), we need to find an integer \(x\) such that \(x \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\). We are given that \(x = 89\) satisfies this condition. The proof involves verifying that \(89 \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\).

  -- We need to show that x = 89 given the conditions.
  have h₂ : x = 89 := by
    -- We know that x * 9 % 100 = 1 from the given hypothesis h₁.
    have : x = 89 := by
      -- We need to solve the congruence x * 9 ≡ 1 (mod 100) to find x.
      have : x = 89 := by
        -- Use the omega tactic to solve the linear congruence.
        omega
      -- The result from the omega tactic confirms that x = 89.
      exact this
    -- We have shown that x = 89, so we can conclude the theorem.
    exact this
  -- The final result is that x = 89.
