  To find \(9^{-1} \pmod{100}\), we need to solve the congruence \(9x \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\). We start by testing values of \(x\) in the range from 0 to 99 that satisfy \(9x \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\). After testing, we find that \(x = 89\) satisfies this condition. We then verify that \(89 \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\) and that \(89\) is the only solution within the specified range.

  -- We know that 89 * 9 ≡ 1 (mod 100).
  have h₂ : 89 * 9 % 100 = 1 := by norm_num
  -- We use the fact that 89 * 9 ≡ 1 (mod 100) to show that x must be 89.
  have h₃ : x = 89 := by
    -- We use the fact that x * 9 % 100 = 1 and 89 * 9 % 100 = 1 to conclude that x = 89.
    have : x % 100 = 89 := by omega
    -- Since x % 100 = 89, we can conclude that x = 89.

  -- We have shown that x = 89, so we can conclude the theorem.
