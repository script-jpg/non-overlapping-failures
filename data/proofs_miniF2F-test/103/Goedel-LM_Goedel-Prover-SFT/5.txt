  To solve for \( x \) in the congruence \( x \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100} \), we need to find the modular inverse of 9 modulo 100. The solution \( x \) must be between 0 and 99, inclusive. We are given that \( x = 89 \) satisfies the congruence. We can verify this by checking that \( 89 \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100} \). This can be done by performing the multiplication and checking the remainder modulo 100.
