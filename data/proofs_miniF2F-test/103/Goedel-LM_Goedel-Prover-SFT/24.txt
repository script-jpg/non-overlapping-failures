  To solve the congruence \(9^{-1} \pmod{100}\), we need to find a number \(x\) such that \(x \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\). Given that \(x \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\), we can directly verify that \(x = 89\) satisfies this condition. We check that \(89 \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\) by performing the multiplication and modular reduction.

  have h : x = 89 := by
    have h₁ := congr_arg (fun x => x % 100) h₁
    -- We need to show that x % 100 = 89.
    simp at h₁
    -- Simplify the expression to isolate x % 100.
    omega
    -- Use the omega tactic to solve the resulting linear congruence.
