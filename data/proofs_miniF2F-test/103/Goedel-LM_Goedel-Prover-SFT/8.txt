  To find \(9^{-1} \pmod{100}\), we need to solve the congruence \(9x \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\). Given that \(x\) is a natural number less than 100 and \(x \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\), we can use the properties of modular arithmetic to show that \(x = 89\).
  1. Start with the given congruence \(9x \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\).
  2. Since \(9 \cdot 9 = 81\), we know that \(9 \cdot x \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\).
  3. To isolate \(x\), we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 9 modulo 100. The inverse of 9 modulo 100 is 89 because \(9 \cdot 89 = 702 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\).
  4. Therefore, \(x \equiv 89 \pmod{100}\).
  5. Given that \(x < 100\), the only solution is \(x = 89\).

  -- We solve for x by finding the multiplicative inverse of 9 modulo 100, which is 89.
  -- This is because 9 * 89 = 702 ≡ 1 (mod 100).
  -- Therefore, x ≡ 89 (mod 100).
  -- Given x < 100, the only solution is x = 89.
