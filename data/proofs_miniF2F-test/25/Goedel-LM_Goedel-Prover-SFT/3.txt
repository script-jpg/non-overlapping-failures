  Given three distinct digits \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) from 1 to 9 that satisfy the following equations:
  1. \( A + B = C \)
  2. \( 10A + A - B = 2C \)
  3. \( C \times B = 10A + A + A \)
  We need to show that the sum \( A + B + C \) is 8.
  First, we derive the value of \( C \) using the first equation:
  \[ A + B = C \]
  Next, we substitute \( C \) into the second equation:
  \[ 10A + A - B = 2(A + B) \]
  \[ 11A - B = 2A + 2B \]
  \[ 11A - 2A = 2B + B \]
  \[ 9A = 3B \]
  \[ 3A = B \]
  Now, we substitute \( B = 3A \) into the third equation:
  \[ C \times 3A = 10A + A + A \]
  \[ C \times 3A = 12A \]
  \[ C = \frac{12A}{3A} \]
  \[ C = 4 \]
  Since \( C \) is a digit, \( C = 4 \).
  Substituting \( C = 4 \) back into \( A + B = C \):
  \[ A + B = 4 \]
  Finally, substituting \( B = 3A \) into the equation \( A + B = 4 \):
  \[ A + 3A = 4 \]
  \[ 4A = 4 \]
  \[ A = 1 \]
  Thus, \( B = 3A = 3 \).
  Therefore, the sum \( A + B + C \) is:
  \[ 1 + 3 + 4 = 8 \]
