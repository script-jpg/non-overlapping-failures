  Given three distinct digits \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) from 1 to 9, we are provided with the following equations:
  1. \( A + B = C \)
  2. \( AA - B = 2C \)
  3. \( C \times B = AA + A \)
  We need to show that the sum \( A + B + C \) is 8.
  First, we use the given equations to derive the values of \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
  From the first equation, \( A + B = C \).
  From the second equation, \( AA - B = 2C \).
  From the third equation, \( C \times B = AA + A \).
  Using these equations, we can solve for each variable step by step.
