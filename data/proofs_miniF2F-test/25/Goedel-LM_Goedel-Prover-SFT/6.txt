  Given the equations involving distinct digits \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) from 1 to 9, we need to find the value of \( A + B + C \). The equations provided are:
  1. \( A + B = C \)
  2. \( 10A + A - B = 2C \)
  3. \( C \times B = 10A + A + A \)
  First, we solve for \( A \) using the third equation. Simplifying the third equation, we get:
  \[ C \times B = 10A + A + A \]
  \[ C \times B = 12A \]
  Since \( A \) is a digit between 1 and 9, we can solve for \( A \):
  \[ A = \frac{C \times B}{12} \]
  Given that \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are digits, \( C \times B \) must be a multiple of 12. We also know that \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are distinct digits from 1 to 9. By testing possible values for \( C \) and \( B \) that satisfy the constraints, we find that \( A = 1 \) is the only value that fits all conditions.
  Next, we solve for \( B \) and \( C \) using the first two equations:
  \[ A + B = C \]
  \[ 1 + B = C \]
  \[ 1 + B = 1 + B \]
  \[ B = B \]
  From the second equation:
  \[ 10A + A - B = 2C \]
  \[ 10 \times 1 + 1 - B = 2C \]
  \[ 11 - B = 2C \]
  Since \( C = 1 + B \), we substitute \( C \) into the equation:
  \[ 11 - B = 2(1 + B) \]
  \[ 11 - B = 2 + 2B \]
  \[ 11 = 2 + 3B \]
  \[ 9 = 3B \]
  \[ B = 3 \]
  Substituting \( B = 3 \) back into \( C = 1 + B \):
  \[ C = 1 + 3 \]
  \[ C = 4 \]
  Finally, we verify that \( A + B + C = 8 \):
  \[ 1 + 3 + 4 = 8 \]
  Thus, the value of \( A + B + C \) is indeed 8.
