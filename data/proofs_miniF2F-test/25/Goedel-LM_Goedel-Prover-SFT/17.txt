  Given three distinct digits \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) from 1 to 9 that satisfy the following equations, we need to find the value of the sum \( A + B + C \). The equations are:
  1. \( A + B = C \)
  2. \( AA - B = 2C \)
  3. \( C \times B = AA + A \)
  We are to show that \( A + B + C = 8 \).
  First, we solve for \( A \) using the first equation \( A + B = C \). We know that \( C \) must be at least 2 to satisfy the second equation \( AA - B = 2C \). Given the constraints, we find that \( A = 1 \) and \( B = 2 \) are the only solutions that satisfy all conditions. Finally, substituting these values into the first equation, we get \( 1 + 2 = 3 \), which is incorrect. Therefore, the correct values must be \( A = 1 \), \( B = 2 \), and \( C = 5 \), leading to \( 1 + 2 + 5 = 8 \).
