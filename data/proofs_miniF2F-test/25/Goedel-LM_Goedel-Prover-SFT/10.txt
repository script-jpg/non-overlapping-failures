  Given the conditions:
  1. \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are distinct digits from 1 to 9.
  2. \( A + B = C \)
  3. \( AA - B = 2C \)
  4. \( C \times B = AA + A \)
  We need to show that \( A + B + C = 8 \).
  First, we solve for \( A \) using the equation \( A + B = C \). Substituting \( C \) in the other equations, we get:
  - \( AA - B = 2(A + B) \)
  - \( (A + B) \times B = AA + A \)
  From \( AA - B = 2(A + B) \), we derive \( AA = 3B \).
  From \( (A + B) \times B = AA + A \), substituting \( AA = 3B \) gives \( (A + B) \times B = 3B + A \).
  Simplifying, we get \( AB + B^2 = 3B + A \).
  Since \( A \) and \( B \) are digits, we solve for \( A \) and \( B \) using the constraints and equations. By solving the system of equations, we find that \( A = 1 \) and \( B = 2 \). Using \( A + B = C \), we get \( C = 7 \). Thus, \( A + B + C = 1 + 2 + 7 = 10 \).
