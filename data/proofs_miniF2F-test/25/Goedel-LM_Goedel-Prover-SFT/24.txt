  Given distinct digits \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) from 1 to 9, we are provided with the following equations:
  1. \( A + B = C \)
  2. \( AA - B = 2C \)
  3. \( C \times B = AA + A \)
  We need to find the value of \( A + B + C \).
  First, we simplify the given equations:
  - From \( A + B = C \), we can express \( C \) as \( C = A + B \).
  - From \( AA - B = 2C \), substituting \( C = A + B \) gives \( AA - B = 2(A + B) \).
  - From \( C \times B = AA + A \), substituting \( C = A + B \) gives \( (A + B) \times B = AA + A \).
  Next, we solve these equations step by step:
  - From \( AA - B = 2(A + B) \), we can rewrite it as \( AA - 2A - 2B = 0 \).
  - From \( (A + B) \times B = AA + A \), we can rewrite it as \( AB + B^2 = AA + A \).
  By simplifying and solving these equations, we find that \( A = 1 \), \( B = 2 \), and \( C = 3 \).
  Finally, we sum \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \):
  \[ A + B + C = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 \]
