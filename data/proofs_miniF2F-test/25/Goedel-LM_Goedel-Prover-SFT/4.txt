  Given three distinct digits \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) from 1 to 9, we are provided with the following equations:
  1. \( A + B = C \)
  2. \( AA - B = 2C \)
  3. \( C \times B = AA + A \)
  We need to show that the sum \( A + B + C \) equals 8.
  First, we normalize the numbers and simplify the given equations using basic arithmetic operations. By substituting the values of \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) that satisfy all the equations, we can verify that the sum \( A + B + C \) indeed equals 8.
