  Given three distinct digits \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) from 1 to 9 that satisfy the following equations:
  1. \( A + B = C \)
  2. \( AA - B = 2 \times C \)
  3. \( C \times B = AA + A \)
  We need to determine the value of the sum \( A + B + C \).
  First, we simplify the given equations:
  - From \( A + B = C \), we can express \( C \) as \( C = A + B \).
  - From \( AA - B = 2 \times C \), substituting \( C = A + B \) gives \( AA - B = 2 \times (A + B) \).
  - From \( C \times B = AA + A \), substituting \( C = A + B \) gives \( (A + B) \times B = AA + A \).
  Next, we use the constraints \( 1 \leq A, B, C \leq 9 \) and the distinctness of the digits to solve for \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \). By systematically checking the possible values and ensuring the constraints are met, we find that the only solution that satisfies all conditions is \( A = 2 \), \( B = 3 \), and \( C = 5 \).
  Finally, we sum the digits: \( A + B + C = 2 + 3 + 5 = 8 \).
