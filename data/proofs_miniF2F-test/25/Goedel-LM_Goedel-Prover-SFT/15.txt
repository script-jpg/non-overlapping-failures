  Given distinct digits \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) from 1 to 9 that satisfy the equations:
  1. \( A + B = C \)
  2. \( 10A + A - B = 2C \)
  3. \( C \times B = 10A + A + A \)
  We need to show that the sum \( A + B + C \) is 8.
  First, we solve for \( C \) using the first equation:
  \[ C = A + B \]
  Next, we substitute \( C \) into the second equation:
  \[ 10A + A - B = 2(A + B) \]
  \[ 11A - B = 2A + 2B \]
  \[ 11A - 2A = 2B + B \]
  \[ 9A = 3B \]
  \[ 3A = B \]
  Now, substitute \( B = 3A \) into the third equation:
  \[ C \times 3A = 10A + A + A \]
  \[ C \times 3A = 12A \]
  \[ C = 4A \]
  Given the constraints \( 1 \leq A \leq 9 \), \( 1 \leq B \leq 9 \), and \( 1 \leq C \leq 9 \), we check the possible values for \( A \):
  - \( A = 1 \) implies \( B = 3 \) and \( C = 4 \)
  - \( A = 2 \) implies \( B = 6 \) and \( C = 8 \)
  - \( A = 3 \) implies \( B = 9 \) and \( C = 12 \) (which is not valid)
  Thus, the only valid solution is \( A = 1 \), \( B = 3 \), and \( C = 4 \), where \( A + B + C = 1 + 3 + 4 = 8 \).
