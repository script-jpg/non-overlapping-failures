  Given the digits \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) from 1 to 9, we are provided with the following equations:
  1. \( A + B = C \)
  2. \( 10A + A - B = 2C \)
  3. \( C \cdot B = 10A + A + A \)
  We need to determine the value of \( A + B + C \).
  First, simplify the second equation:
  \[ 10A + A - B = 2C \]
  \[ 11A - B = 2C \]
  Next, simplify the third equation:
  \[ C \cdot B = 10A + A + A \]
  \[ C \cdot B = 12A \]
  Now, we have the system of equations:
  1. \( A + B = C \)
  2. \( 11A - B = 2C \)
  3. \( C \cdot B = 12A \)
  From the first equation, express \( C \) in terms of \( A \) and \( B \):
  \[ C = A + B \]
  Substitute \( C = A + B \) into the second equation:
  \[ 11A - B = 2(A + B) \]
  \[ 11A - B = 2A + 2B \]
  \[ 9A = 3B \]
  \[ 3A = B \]
  Substitute \( B = 3A \) into the third equation:
  \[ (A + B) \cdot 3A = 12A \]
  \[ (A + 3A) \cdot 3A = 12A \]
  \[ 4A \cdot 3A = 12A \]
  \[ 12A^2 = 12A \]
  \[ A^2 = A \]
  \[ A(A - 1) = 0 \]
  Since \( 1 \leq A \leq 9 \), we have \( A = 1 \).
  Substitute \( A = 1 \) back into \( B = 3A \):
  \[ B = 3 \cdot 1 = 3 \]
  Finally, substitute \( A = 1 \) and \( B = 3 \) into \( C = A + B \):
  \[ C = 1 + 3 = 4 \]
  Thus, the value of \( A + B + C \) is:
  \[ 1 + 3 + 4 = 8 \]
