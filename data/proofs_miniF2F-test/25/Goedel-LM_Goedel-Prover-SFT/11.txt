  Given three distinct digits \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) from 1 to 9, we are provided with the following equations:
  1. \( A + B = C \)
  2. \( AA - B = 2C \)
  3. \( C \times B = AA + A \)
  We need to determine the value of the sum \( A + B + C \).
  First, we simplify the given equations:
  - From \( A + B = C \), we can express \( C \) as \( C = A + B \).
  - From \( AA - B = 2C \), substituting \( C = A + B \) gives \( AA - B = 2(A + B) \), which simplifies to \( AA - B = 2A + 2B \).
  - From \( C \times B = AA + A \), substituting \( C = A + B \) gives \( (A + B) \times B = AA + A \), which simplifies to \( AB + B^2 = AA + A \).
  Next, we solve these equations step by step:
  - From \( AA - B = 2A + 2B \), we get \( AA - 2A - 2B = B \), which simplifies to \( A(A - 2) = B + 2B \), or \( A(A - 2) = 3B \).
  - From \( AB + B^2 = AA + A \), we get \( AB + B^2 = AA + A \), which simplifies to \( B(A + B) = AA + A \), or \( B(A + B) = AA + A \).
  Given the constraints \( 1 \leq A, B, C \leq 9 \) and the distinctness of the digits, we can solve for \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) using the simplified equations and constraints.
  Finally, we find that \( A + B + C = 8 \).
