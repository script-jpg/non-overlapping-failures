  Given the conditions:
  1. \( A + B = C \)
  2. \( AA - B = 2C \)
  3. \( C \times B = AA + A \)
  We need to find the value of \( A + B + C \).
  First, we derive that \( C = A + B \) from the first equation.
  Next, we use the second equation:
  \[ 10A + A - B = 2C \]
  \[ 11A - B = 2C \]
  Substituting \( C = A + B \) into the second equation:
  \[ 11A - B = 2(A + B) \]
  \[ 11A - B = 2A + 2B \]
  \[ 11A - 2A = 2B + B \]
  \[ 9A = 3B \]
  \[ 3A = B \]
  Now, substituting \( B = 3A \) into the third equation:
  \[ C \times 3A = 10A + A + A \]
  \[ C \times 3A = 12A \]
  \[ C = 4A \]
  Finally, substituting \( C = 4A \) and \( B = 3A \) into the sum \( A + B + C \):
  \[ A + 3A + 4A = 8A \]
  Given the constraints \( 1 \leq A \leq 9 \), the only possible value for \( A \) that satisfies all conditions is \( A = 1 \).
  Thus, \( A + B + C = 8 \).
