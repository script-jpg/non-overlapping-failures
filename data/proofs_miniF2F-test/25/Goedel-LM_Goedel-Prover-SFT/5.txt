  Given three distinct digits \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) from 1 to 9, they satisfy the following equations:
  1. \( A + B = C \)
  2. \( 10A + A - B = 2C \)
  3. \( C \times B = 10A + A + A \)
  We need to show that \( A + B + C = 8 \).
  First, we solve for \( A \) using the first equation \( A + B = C \). Since \( A \) and \( B \) are distinct digits from 1 to 9, we can use the constraints to find \( A \).
  Next, we use the second equation \( 10A + A - B = 2C \) to find \( B \) and \( C \). By substituting \( A \) into the equation and solving for \( B \) and \( C \), we find that \( B \) and \( C \) must also satisfy the third equation \( C \times B = 10A + A + A \).
  Finally, we sum \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) to verify that their sum equals 8.
