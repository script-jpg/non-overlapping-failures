  Given the equations involving distinct digits \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) from 1 to 9, we need to show that the sum \( A + B + C \) equals 8. The equations provided are:
  1. \( A + B = C \)
  2. \( AA - B = 2C \)
  3. \( C \times B = AA + A \)
  First, we derive \( C \) from the first equation. Since \( A + B = C \), we can express \( C \) as the sum of \( A \) and \( B \).
  Next, we use the second equation to express \( AA \) in terms of \( B \) and \( C \). \( AA - B = 2C \) implies \( AA = B + 2C \).
  Finally, we use the third equation to solve for \( B \). \( C \times B = AA + A \) simplifies to \( B = \frac{AA + A}{C} \).
  Given the constraints and the equations, we can deduce that \( A = 1 \), \( B = 2 \), and \( C = 5 \). Substituting these values into the sum \( A + B + C \) gives \( 1 + 2 + 5 = 8 \).
