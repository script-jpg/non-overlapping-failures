  Given three distinct digits \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) from 1 to 9 that satisfy the following equations:
  1. \( A + B = C \)
  2. \( 10A + A - B = 2C \)
  3. \( C \times B = 10A + A + A \)
  We need to determine the value of the sum \( A + B + C \).
  First, we solve for \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) using the given equations. From the first equation, we have:
  \[ A + B = C \]
  Substituting \( C \) in the second equation:
  \[ 10A + A - B = 2(A + B) \]
  \[ 11A - B = 2A + 2B \]
  \[ 11A - 2A = 2B + B \]
  \[ 9A = 3B \]
  \[ 3A = B \]
  Now, substituting \( B = 3A \) in the third equation:
  \[ C \times 3A = 10A + A + A \]
  \[ 3C A = 12A \]
  \[ C = 4 \]
  Since \( C = 4 \), we substitute back to find \( A \) and \( B \):
  \[ A + B = 4 \]
  \[ A + 3A = 4 \]
  \[ 4A = 4 \]
  \[ A = 1 \]
  \[ B = 3 \]
  Finally, we verify the sum:
  \[ A + B + C = 1 + 3 + 4 = 8 \]

    -- Substitute C in the second equation: 10A + A - B = 2(A + B)
    -- Simplify to find A: 9A = 3B, hence 3A = B
    -- Substitute B = 3A into the third equation: C * 3A = 10A + A + A
    -- Simplify to find C: C = 4
    -- Substitute C = 4 back into the first equation: A + B = 4
