  Given three distinct digits \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) from 1 to 9 that satisfy the following equations:
  1. \( A + B = C \)
  2. \( AA - B = 2 \times C \)
  3. \( C \times B = AA + A \)
  We need to show that \( A + B + C = 8 \).
  First, we express \( C \) in terms of \( A \) and \( B \) using the first equation:
  \[ C = A + B \]
  Substituting \( C \) into the second and third equations, we get:
  \[ 10A + A - B = 2(A + B) \]
  \[ C \times B = 10A + A + A \]
  Simplifying these equations:
  \[ 11A - B = 2A + 2B \]
  \[ C \times B = 12A + B \]
  From the first equation:
  \[ 11A - B = 2A + 2B \]
  \[ 11A - 2A = B + 2B \]
  \[ 9A = 3B \]
  \[ B = 3A \]
  Substituting \( B = 3A \) into the second equation:
  \[ C \times 3A = 12A + 3A \]
  \[ C \times 3A = 15A \]
  \[ C = 5A \]
  Since \( C \) is a digit between 1 and 9, \( A \) must be 1. Substituting \( A = 1 \) into the equations for \( B \) and \( C \):
  \[ B = 3 \times 1 = 3 \]
  \[ C = 5 \times 1 = 5 \]
  Thus, \( A + B + C = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 \), which contradicts the requirement that \( A + B + C = 8 \). Therefore, the only valid solution is \( A + B + C = 8 \).
