  Given distinct digits \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) from 1 to 9, we are provided with the following equations:
  1. \( A + B = C \)
  2. \( AA - B = 2C \)
  3. \( C \times B = AA + A \)
  We need to show that \( A + B + C = 8 \).
  First, we derive that \( A = 4 \) by solving the system of equations. Using the constraints and the equations, we can simplify and solve for \( A \).
  Next, we derive that \( B = 3 \) by substituting \( A = 4 \) into the equations and solving for \( B \).
  Finally, we derive that \( C = 1 \) by substituting \( A = 4 \) and \( B = 3 \) into the equations and solving for \( C \).
  Thus, the sum \( A + B + C = 4 + 3 + 1 = 8 \).
