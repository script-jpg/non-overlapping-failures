  Given distinct digits \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) from 1 to 9, we are provided with the following equations:
  1. \( A + B = C \)
  2. \( 10A + A - B = 2C \)
  3. \( C \times B = 10A + A + A \)
  We need to show that the sum \( A + B + C \) equals 8.
  First, from the first equation, we have:
  \[ A + B = C \]
  Next, substituting \( C \) from the first equation into the second equation:
  \[ 10A + A - B = 2(A + B) \]
  \[ 10A + A - B = 2A + 2B \]
  \[ 11A - B = 2A + 2B \]
  \[ 11A - 2A = 2B + B \]
  \[ 9A = 3B \]
  \[ 3A = B \]
  Now, substituting \( B = 3A \) into the third equation:
  \[ C \times 3A = 10A + A + A \]
  \[ C \times 3A = 12A \]
  \[ C = \frac{12A}{3A} \]
  \[ C = 4 \]
  Since \( C \) is a digit between 1 and 9, \( C = 4 \) is the only solution.
  Substituting \( C = 4 \) back into the first equation:
  \[ A + B = 4 \]
  Given \( B = 3A \), we substitute \( B \) into the equation:
  \[ A + 3A = 4 \]
  \[ 4A = 4 \]
  \[ A = 1 \]
  Then \( B = 3A = 3 \).
  Finally, the sum \( A + B + C \) is:
  \[ 1 + 3 + 4 = 8 \]
