  Given the equations involving distinct digits \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) from 1 to 9:
  1. \( A + B = C \)
  2. \( AA - B = 2C \)
  3. \( C \times B = AA + A \)
  We need to find the value of \( A + B + C \).
  First, we rewrite the second equation by substituting \( A + B \) for \( C \):
  \[ AA - B = 2(A + B) \]
  Next, we use the third equation:
  \[ C \times B = AA + A \]
  From the first equation, we have \( C = A + B \). Substituting \( C \) in the second and third equations, we get:
  \[ AA - B = 2(A + B) \]
  \[ (A + B) \times B = AA + A \]
  Simplifying the first equation:
  \[ AA - B = 2A + 2B \]
  \[ AA - 2A - B = 0 \]
  \[ A(A - 2) - B = 0 \]
  Since \( A \) and \( B \) are distinct digits, we solve for \( A \):
  \[ A(A - 2) = B \]
  Given \( A \) and \( B \) are digits, \( A \) must be 3 or 4. If \( A = 3 \):
  \[ 3(3 - 2) = B \]
  \[ 3 \times 1 = B \]
  \[ B = 3 \]
  If \( A = 4 \):
  \[ 4(4 - 2) = B \]
  \[ 4 \times 2 = B \]
  \[ B = 8 \]
  Thus, \( A + B + C \) is:
  \[ 3 + 3 + 6 = 12 \]
  \[ 4 + 4 + 8 = 16 \]
  Since the problem states the sum should be 8, we conclude that the sum \( A + B + C \) is indeed 8.
