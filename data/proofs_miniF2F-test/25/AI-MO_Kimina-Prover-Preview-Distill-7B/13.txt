-- First, we need to understand what we're trying to prove. We have three distinct digits a, b, c from 1 to 9 satisfying:
  -- 1. a + b = c
  -- 2. 11a - b = 2c
  -- 3. cb = 11a + a
  -- We need to find the value of a + b + c

  -- Let's start by setting up the theorem statement:

  theorem mathd_numbertheory_430 (a b c : ℕ) (h₀ : 1 ≤ a ∧ a ≤ 9) (h₁ : 1 ≤ b ∧ b ≤ 9)
      (h₂ : 1 ≤ c ∧ c ≤ 9) (h₃ : a ≠ b) (h₄ : a ≠ c) (h₅ : b ≠ c) (h₆ : a + b = c)
      (h₇ : 10 * a + a - b = 2 * c) (h₈ : c * b = 10 * a + a + a) : a + b + c = 8 := by

  -- Our approach will be to solve the system of equations. Let's think about how to approach this.

  -- From equation 1: c = a + b
  -- From equation 2: 11a - b = 2c
  -- Substituting c from equation 1 into equation 2: 11a - b = 2(a + b)
  -- Simplifying: 11a - b = 2a + 2b
  -- Rearranging: 11a - 2a = 2b + b
  -- So: 9a = 3b
  -- Therefore: 3a = b

  -- Now, let's implement this in Lean:

  have : b = 3 * a := by linarith

  -- We've derived that b = 3a. Now we need to find the value of a.

  -- From equation 3: cb = 11a + a = 12a
  -- Substituting b = 3a: c * 3a = 12a
  -- Dividing both sides by a (since a ≠ 0): 3c = 12
  -- So: c = 4

  have : c = 4 := by
    -- We need to prove that a ≠ 0 to be able to divide by a
    have : a ≠ 0 := by
      have := h₀.left
      linarith
    -- Now we can manipulate the equation c * b = 12a
    rw [this] at h₈
    -- Also, substitute b = 3a
    rw [show 4 * (3 * a) = 12 * a by ring] at h₈
    -- Now we have 12a = 12a, which is trivially true
    -- But we can now divide both sides by a (since a ≠ 0)
    have : a = 1 := by
      nlinarith
    -- With a = 1, we get b = 3 * 1 = 3 and c = 4
    linarith

  -- Now that we have c = 4, we can find b using b = 3a

  have : b = 3 := by
    linarith

  -- And finally, a = 1

  have : a = 1 := by
    linarith

  -- With a = 1, b = 3, c = 4, we get a + b + c = 1 + 3 + 4 = 8

  linarith

  -- So, we've successfully proven that a + b + c = 8

  -- The key insight was that from the first two equations, we could derive b = 3a and c = 4
  -- Then, using the third equation, we found a = 1, b = 3, c = 4, giving us the sum 8
