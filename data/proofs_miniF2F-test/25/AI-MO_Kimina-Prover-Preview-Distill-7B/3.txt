-- Show that $A + B + C = 8$.

  -- From the first equation, we have $A + B = C$.
  -- From the second equation, we have $AA - B = 2C$.
  -- From the third equation, we have $CB = AA + A$.

  -- Since $A$, $B$, and $C$ are digits from 1 to 9, and they are distinct,
  -- we can try all possible values for $A$ and see if there exist corresponding $B$ and $C$ that satisfy all three equations.

  -- Suppose $A = 1$.
  -- Then from the first equation, $1 + B = C$.
  -- From the second equation, $11 - B = 2C$.
  -- From the third equation, $C \times B = 11 + 1 = 12$.

  -- We can solve these equations:
  -- From $1 + B = C$ and $11 - B = 2C$, we get $C = 11 - B$ from the second equation, and substituting into the first equation gives $1 + B = 11 - B$, so $2B = 10$, giving $B = 5$.
  -- Then $C = 11 - 5 = 6$.
  -- Check the third equation: $C \times B = 6 \times 5 = 30 \stackrel{?}{=} 12$.
  -- This is false, so $A = 1$ is not possible.

  -- Suppose $A = 2$.
  -- Then from the first equation, $2 + B = C$.
  -- From the second equation, $22 - B = 2C$.
  -- From the third equation, $C \times B = 22 + 2 = 24$.

  -- Solving these:
  -- From $2 + B = C$ and $22 - B = 2C$, we get $C = 22 - B$ from the second equation, and substituting into the first equation gives $2 + B = 22 - B$, so $2B = 20$, giving $B = 10$.
  -- But $B$ must be a single digit (1-9), so this is impossible.

  -- Suppose $A = 3$.
  -- Then from the first equation, $3 + B = C$.
  -- From the second equation, $33 - B = 2C$.
  -- From the third equation, $C \times B = 33 + 3 = 36$.

  -- Solving:
  -- From $3 + B = C$ and $33 - B = 2C$, we get $C = 33 - B$ from the second equation, and substituting into the first equation gives $3 + B = 33 - B$, so $2B = 30$, giving $B = 15$.
  -- This is also not a single digit, so $A = 3$ is impossible.

  -- Continuing in this way, we find that $A = 4$ is also impossible.

  -- Suppose $A = 5$.
  -- Then from the first equation, $5 + B = C$.
  -- From the second equation, $55 - B = 2C$.
  -- From the third equation, $C \times B = 55 + 5 = 60$.

  -- Solving:
  -- From $5 + B = C$ and $55 - B = 2C$, we get $C = 55 - B$ from the second equation, and substituting into the first equation gives $5 + B = 55 - B$, so $2B = 50$, giving $B = 25$.
  -- This is also not a single digit, so $A = 5$ is impossible.

  -- Suppose $A = 6$.
  -- Then from the first equation, $6 + B = C$.
  -- From the second equation, $66 - B = 2C$.
  -- From the third equation, $C \times B = 66 + 6 = 72$.

  -- Solving:
  -- From $6 + B = C$ and $66 - B = 2C$, we get $C = 66 - B$ from the second equation, and substituting into the first equation gives $6 + B = 66 - B$, so $2B = 60$, giving $B = 30$.
  -- This is also not a single digit, so $A = 6$ is impossible.

  -- Suppose $A = 7$.
  -- Then from the first equation, $7 + B = C$.
  -- From the second equation, $77 - B = 2C$.
  -- From the third equation, $C \times B = 77 + 7 = 84$.

  -- Solving:
  -- From $7 + B = C$ and $77 - B = 2C$, we get $C = 77 - B$ from the second equation, and substituting into the first equation gives $7 + B = 77 - B$, so $2B = 70$, giving $B = 35$.
  -- This is also not a single digit, so $A = 7$ is impossible.

  -- Suppose $A = 8$.
  -- Then from the first equation, $8 + B = C$.
  -- From the second equation, $88 - B = 2C$.
  -- From the third equation, $C \times B = 88 + 8 = 96$.

  -- Solving:
  -- From $8 + B = C$ and $88 - B = 2C$, we get $C = 88 - B$ from the second equation, and substituting into the first equation gives $8 + B = 88 - B$, so $2B = 80$, giving $B = 40$.
  -- This is also not a single digit, so $A = 8$ is impossible.

  -- Finally, suppose $A = 9$.
  -- Then from the first equation, $9 + B = C$.
  -- From the second equation, $99 - B = 2C$.
  -- From the third equation, $C \times B = 99 + 9 = 108$.

  -- Solving:
  -- From $9 + B = C$ and $99 - B = 2C$, we get $C = 99 - B$ from the second equation, and substituting into the first equation gives $9 + B = 99 - B$, so $2B = 90$, giving $B = 45$.
  -- This is also not a single digit, so $A = 9$ is impossible.

  -- After testing all possible values for $A$ from 1 to 9, we find that there is no solution where all three equations are satisfied with $A$, $B$, and $C$ being distinct digits from 1 to 9.

  -- Therefore, there must be a contradiction in the equations, or the answer might not be 8.
  -- However, if we assume the problem is correct and there is a unique solution, we can try to solve it algebraically.

  -- From the first equation: $A + B = C$.
  -- From the second equation: $11A - B = 2C$.
  -- From the third equation: $CB = 11A + A = 12A$.

  -- Substituting $C = A + B$ from the first equation into the second equation: $11A - B = 2(A + B)$
  -- $11A - B = 2A + 2B$
  -- $11A - 2A = 2B + B$
  -- $9A = 3B$
  -- $3A = B$
  -- So $B = 3A$.

  -- Now, substituting $B = 3A$ and $C = A + B = A + 3A = 4A$ into the third equation: $C \times B = 12A$
  -- $4A \times 3A = 12A$
  -- $12A^2 = 12A$
  -- $A^2 = A$
  -- $A^2 - A = 0$
  -- $A(A - 1) = 0$
  -- So $A = 0$ or $A = 1$.

  -- But $A$ must be from 1 to 9, so $A = 1$.

  -- If $A = 1$, then $B = 3 \times 1 = 3$ and $C = 4 \times 1 = 4$.
  -- Check all equations:
  -- $A + B = 1 + 3 = 4 = C$ ✓
  -- $AA - B = 11 - 3 = 8 \neq 2 \times 4 = 8$ ✗

  -- There is a contradiction here, which means there is no solution with distinct digits from 1 to 9.
  -- However, if we allow non-distinct digits, $A = 1$, $B = 3$, $C = 4$ would be a solution, but it doesn't satisfy all equations with $A = B = 1$.
  -- The problem specifies they are distinct, so there must be an error in the problem statement or our understanding of it.

  -- Since we are to prove $A + B + C = 8$, and we know $A + B = C$, then $A + B + C = C + C = 2C$.
  -- From the equations, we should get $C = 4$ as the only valid solution (if it existed), making $A + B + C = 8$.

  -- Since we have tested all values and found contradictions, the problem might have an error, but assuming it has a unique solution:

  -- From the algebraic approach, if $A = 1$, $B = 3$, $C = 4$ were a solution, then $A + B + C = 1 + 3 + 4 = 8$.

  -- Since Lean is a proof assistant, it will reveal the contradiction:

  have h₉ : a + b + c = 8 := by
    omega

  exact h₉
