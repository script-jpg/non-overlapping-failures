-- We have $A + B = C$. So $C \geq 2$ since $A \geq 1$ and $B \geq 1$.  We also have $C < 10$ since

  have hc_lt_10 : c < 10 := by omega

  -- We have $C \times B = 30$ from the third equation. So the possible values of $C$ are 1, 2, 3, 5, or 6.
  have hc : c = 1 ∨ c = 2 ∨ c = 3 ∨ c = 5 ∨ c = 6 := by omega

  -- If $C = 1$, then $B = 30$ which is impossible since $B \leq 9$. If $C = 2$, then $B = 15$ which is
  -- also impossible since $B \leq 9$. So $C \geq 3$.
  have hc_ge_3 : c ≥ 3 := by omega

  -- Since $C \times B = 30$ and $B \leq 9$, we have $C \leq 30/9 = 3.333...$. So $C \leq 3$.

  -- From the above, we have $C = 3$. So $B = 10$ from the third equation, which is impossible
