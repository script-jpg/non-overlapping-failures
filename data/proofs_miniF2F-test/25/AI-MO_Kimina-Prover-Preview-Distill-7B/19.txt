The proof is correct. Let's analyze why.

First, we have three equations:
1. $A + B = C$ 
2. $AA - B = 2C$ 
3. $CB = AA + A$

Where $AA$ represents a two-digit number with digits $A$ (i.e., $10A + A$).

From equation 1: $C = A + B$

From equation 2: $10A + A - B = 2C$ 
Substituting $C = A + B$: 
$10A + A - B = 2(A + B)$
$11A - B = 2A + 2B$
$11A - 2A = 2B + B$
$9A = 3B$
$3A = B$

From equation 3: $C \cdot B = 10A + A + A$
$C \cdot B = 10A + 2A$
$C \cdot B = 12A$

Substituting $B = 3A$ and $C = A + B = A + 3A = 4A$ into the third equation:
$4A \cdot 3A = 12A$
$12A^2 = 12A$
$12A^2 - 12A = 0$
$12A(A - 1) = 0$

So either $A = 0$ or $A = 1$. But $A$ is a digit from 1 to 9, so $A = 1$.

If $A = 1$:
$B = 3A = 3 \cdot 1 = 3$
$C = 4A = 4 \cdot 1 = 4$

But this gives $C = 4$ and $A + B = 1 + 3 = 4$, which is consistent. However, let's check the equations again:

1. $A + B = C \implies 1 + 3 = 4$ ✓
2. $AA - B = 2C \implies 11 - 3 = 2 \cdot 4 \implies 8 = 8$ ✓
3. $CB = AA + A \implies 4 \cdot 3 = 11 + 1 \implies 12 = 12$ ✓

Wait, $C = 4$, $B = 3$, $A = 1$ actually works! 

But the answer should be $A + B + C = 1 + 3 + 4 = 8$.

Let's continue with the Lean proof:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

```

We are importing the necessary libraries and setting up the environment for mathematical reasoning in Lean. The `maxHeartbeats 0` option allows Lean to run without any limits on the number of steps, which is useful for complex arithmetic problems.

Now, let's define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_430 (a b c : ℕ) (h₀ : 1 ≤ a ∧ a ≤ 9) (h₁ : 1 ≤ b ∧ b ≤ 9)
    (h₂ : 1 ≤ c ∧ c ≤ 9) (h₃ : a ≠ b) (h₄ : a ≠ c) (h₅ : b ≠ c) (h₆ : a + b = c)
    (h₇ : 10 * a + a - b = 2 * c) (h₈ : c * b = 10 * a + a + a) : a + b + c = 8 := by
```

We have the theorem statement with all the given constraints. Now we need to solve for $a + b + c$.

From h₆: $a + b = c$
From h₇: $10a + a - b = 2c \implies 11a - b = 2c$
Substituting $c = a + b$ into h₇: $11a - b = 2(a + b) \implies 11a - b = 2a + 2b \implies 9a = 3b \implies 3a = b$
From h₈: $c \cdot b = 10a + a + a \implies c \cdot b = 12a$
Substituting $b = 3a$ and $c = a + b = 4a$ into h₈: $4a \cdot 3a = 12a \implies 12a^2 = 12a \implies 12a^2 - 12a = 0 \implies 12a(a - 1) = 0$
Since $a \neq 0$ (as $1 \leq a \leq 9$), we must have $a = 1$.

If $a = 1$:
- $b = 3a = 3 \cdot 1 = 3$
- $c = a + b = 1 + 3 = 4$
- Check h₈: $c \cdot b = 4 \cdot 3 = 12$ and $12a = 12 \cdot 1 = 12$ ✓

So $a = 1$, $b = 3$, $c = 4$ is a valid solution, and $a + b + c = 1 + 3 + 4 = 8$.

Let's continue with the Lean proof:

```tactics
have hc : c = a + b := by linarith
rw [hc] at h₇ h₈
have hb : b = 3 * a := by
  omega
have ha : a = 1 := by
  nlinarith [h₈, hb, h₀.left, h₁.left]
have hb' : b = 3 := by
  linarith [hb, ha]
have hc' : c = 4 := by
  linarith [hc, ha, hb']
linarith [ha, hb', hc']
```

And with that, the Lean proof is complete. The key insights were:
1. From h₆: $c = a + b$
2. From h₇: $11a - b = 2(a + b) \implies 9a = 3b \implies 3a = b$
3. From h₈: $c \cdot b = 12a \implies 4a \cdot 3a = 12a \implies 12a^2 = 12a \implies a = 1$
4. Thus $a = 1$, $b = 3$, $c = 4$, and $a + b + c = 8$

The Lean proof correctly solves the system of equations while respecting all constraints, confirming that $A + B + C = 8$.
