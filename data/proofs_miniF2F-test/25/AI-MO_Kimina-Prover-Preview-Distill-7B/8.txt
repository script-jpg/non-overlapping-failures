-- We have $A + B = C$. So $C \geq 2$ since $A \geq 1$ and $B \geq 1$. 
  have : c ≥ 2 := by omega

  -- From the second equation $A+9B=2C$. Since $B$ and $C$ are distinct and $B \ne 0$, we have $C = 2$.
  have : c = 2 := by omega

  -- From the third equation $B \times C = 22 + A$. Since $C = 2$, we have $B \times 2 = 22 + A$. Since $A$
  -- is not 0, $B$ cannot be 11, so $B = 7$ and $A = 6$.
  have : b = 7 ∧ a = 6 := by omega

  -- The desired result is $A + B + C = 6 + 7 + 2 = 15$.
