This Lean 4 proof solves the number theory problem where we have three distinct digits A, B, C from 1 to 9 satisfying:
1. A + B = C
2. AA - B = 2 × C (where AA is a two-digit number with digits A)
3. C × B = AA + A

Let's think about how to solve this algebraically first, then translate it to Lean 4.

From equation 1: C = A + B

From equation 2: 10A + A - B = 2C
              11A - B = 2C

Substituting C from equation 1 into equation 2:
11A - B = 2(A + B)
11A - B = 2A + 2B
11A - 2A = 2B + B
9A = 3B
3A = B

From equation 3: C × B = 10A + A + A
               C × B = 11A + A
               C × B = 12A

Substituting B = 3A and C = A + B = A + 3A = 4A into equation 3:
4A × 3A = 12A
12A² = 12A
12A² - 12A = 0
12A(A - 1) = 0

So A = 0 or A = 1. But A is a digit from 1 to 9, so A = 1.

If A = 1, then B = 3A = 3, and C = 4A = 4.

Check if these satisfy all equations:
1. 1 + 3 = 4 ✓
2. 11 - 3 = 8, and 2 × 4 = 8 ✓
3. 4 × 3 = 12, and 12 ✓

So A = 1, B = 3, C = 4, and A + B + C = 1 + 3 + 4 = 8.

Let's translate this to Lean 4:

Now we define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_430 (a b c : ℕ) (h₀ : 1 ≤ a ∧ a ≤ 9) (h₁ : 1 ≤ b ∧ b ≤ 9)
    (h₂ : 1 ≤ c ∧ c ≤ 9) (h₃ : a ≠ b) (h₄ : a ≠ c) (h₅ : b ≠ c) (h₆ : a + b = c)
    (h₇ : 10 * a + a - b = 2 * c) (h₈ : c * b = 10 * a + a + a) : a + b + c = 8 := by
```

Now we need to solve the system of equations. From h₆: c = a + b
From h₇: 11a - b = 2c
Substituting c from h₆ into h₇: 11a - b = 2(a + b)
11a - b = 2a + 2b
9a = 3b
3a = b

From h₈: c * b = 12a
Substituting b = 3a and c = a + b = 4a: 4a * 3a = 12a
12a² = 12a
12a² - 12a = 0
12a(a - 1) = 0

Since a is from 1 to 9, a = 1
Then b = 3 * 1 = 3
c = 4 * 1 = 4
a + b + c = 1 + 3 + 4 = 8

Let's complete the Lean proof:

```tactics
have hc : c = a + b := by linarith
rw [hc] at h₇ h₈
```

Now h₇ becomes: 11a - b = 2(a + b)
9a = 3b
3a = b

And h₈ becomes: (a + b) * b = 12a

Let's continue with the algebraic manipulation in Lean:

```tactics
have h9 : 3 * a = b := by
  omega
```

Now we have b = 3a. Let's substitute into h₈:

(a + b) * b = 12a
(a + 3a) * 3a = 12a
4a * 3a = 12a
12a² = 12a
12a² - 12a = 0
12a(a - 1) = 0

Since a is from 1 to 9, a = 1

```tactics
have ha : a = 1 := by
  nlinarith [h₈, h9, h₀.left, h₁.left]
```

Now that we have a = 1, we can find b:

b = 3a = 3 * 1 = 3

```tactics
have hb : b = 3 := by
  linarith [h9, ha]
```

And c = a + b = 1 + 3 = 4

```tactics
have hc : c = 4 := by
  linarith [hc, ha, hb]
```

Finally, a + b + c = 1 + 3 + 4 = 8

```tactics
linarith [ha, hb, hc]
```

So indeed, the value of A + B + C is 8.
