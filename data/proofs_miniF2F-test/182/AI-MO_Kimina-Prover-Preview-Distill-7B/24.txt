-- The key is to compute $f(3)$ directly by using the given function definition and constraints.

  -- First, specialize `h₀` at $x = -3$ to get the equation for $f(-3)$.
  have h₁ := h₀ (-3)

  -- Now, specialize `h₀` at $x = 3$ to get the equation for $f(3)$.
  have h₃ := h₀ 3

  -- The equations are:
  -- $f(-3) = a \cdot (-3)^4 - b \cdot (-3)^2 + (-3) + 5 = 2$
  -- $f(3) = a \cdot 3^4 - b \cdot 3^2 + 3 + 5$

  -- Simplify the expressions.
  norm_num at h₁ h₃

  -- Substitute the value of $f(-3)$ from `h₂` into the equation from `h₁`.
  rw [h₂] at h₁

  -- Now, solve for $f(3)$ by eliminating $a$ and $b$.
