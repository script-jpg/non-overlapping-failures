In this proof, we first compute $f(-3)$ using the given formula for $f(x)$. We know that $f(-3) = 2$, so we can write an equation for $a$ and $b$. Then we compute $f(3)$ using the same formula. Notice that when we substitute $x = -3$ and $x = 3$ into the polynomial, the terms with even powers of $x$ will be the same, and the terms with odd powers will change sign. Specifically, for $f(-3)$, we have:

- $(-3)^4 = 3^4$ (since 4 is even)
- $(-3)^2 = 3^2$ (since 2 is even)
- $-3$ is the same as $-3$ (linear term)

So $f(-3) = a \cdot 3^4 - b \cdot 3^2 - 3 + 5 = 2$.

Now for $f(3)$:
- $3^4 = 3^4$ (since 4 is even)
- $3^2 = 3^2$ (since 2 is even)
- $3$ is the same as $3$ (linear term)

So $f(3) = a \cdot 3^4 - b \cdot 3^2 + 3 + 5$.

Since we know $a \cdot 3^4 - b \cdot 3^2 - 3 + 5 = 2$, we can solve for $a \cdot 3^4 - b \cdot 3^2 = 2 + 3 - 5 = 0$.

Substituting into $f(3)$, we get $0 + 3 + 5 = 8$.

Thus, $f(3) = 8$.
</-- If $f(x)=ax^4-bx^2+x+5$ and $f(-3)=2,$ then what is the value of $f(3)$? Show that it is 8.-/
