-- Let's write out $f(-3)$ using the given formula:
  have h_neg3 : f (-3) = a * (-3) ^ 4 - b * (-3) ^ 2 + (-3) + 5 := by
    apply h₀
  -- and simplify:
  norm_num at h_neg3
  -- We know that $f(-3) = 2$, so we can form the equation $a \cdot 81 - b \cdot 9 - 3 + 5 = 2$

  -- We can see that $f(3)$ can be expressed in terms of the equation we have:
