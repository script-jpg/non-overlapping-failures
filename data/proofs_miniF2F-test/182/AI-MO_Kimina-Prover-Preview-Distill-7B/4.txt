-- The value of $f(3)$ is 8. We can show this by directly computing $f(3)$ using the given function definition and then using the fact that $f(-3) = 2$ to find the relationship between $a$ and $b$.

  have h₃ : f 3 = a * 3 ^ 4 - b * 3 ^ 2 + 3 + 5 := by rw [h₀]

  -- Now, we need to use the fact that $f(-3) = 2$ to find the value of $f(3)$. Let's compute $f(-3)$ using the function definition:

  have h₁ : f (-3) = a * (-3) ^ 4 - b * (-3) ^ 2 + (-3) + 5 := by rw [h₀]

  -- Since $f(-3) = 2$, we have:

  rw [h₁] at h₂

  -- Notice that $(-3)^4 = 3^4$ and $(-3)^2 = 3^2$ because the exponent is even. So we can simplify the equation:

  norm_num at h₂

  -- After simplifying, we will have an equation involving $a$ and $b$. Now, we can substitute this into our expression for $f(3)$:

  rw [h₃]

  -- Again, we can simplify $3^4$ and $3^2$:

  norm_num

  -- At this point, we will have an expression for $f(3)$ that involves the equation we derived from $f(-3) = 2$. We can use the `linarith` tactic to solve the resulting system of linear equations:
