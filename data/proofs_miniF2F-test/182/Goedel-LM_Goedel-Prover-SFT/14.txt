  Given the function \( f(x) = ax^4 - bx^2 + x + 5 \) and the condition \( f(-3) = 2 \), we need to determine the value of \( f(3) \).
  First, substitute \( x = -3 \) into the function:
  \[ f(-3) = a(-3)^4 - b(-3)^2 + (-3) + 5 = 2 \]
  Simplify the expression:
  \[ 81a - 9b - 3 + 5 = 2 \]
  \[ 81a - 9b + 2 = 2 \]
  \[ 81a - 9b = 0 \]
  \[ 9a - b = 0 \]
  \[ b = 9a \]
  Next, substitute \( x = 3 \) into the function:
  \[ f(3) = a(3)^4 - b(3)^2 + 3 + 5 \]
  Simplify the expression:
  \[ 81a - 9b + 3 + 5 \]
  \[ 81a - 9b + 8 \]
  Using the relationship \( b = 9a \):
  \[ 81a - 9(9a) + 8 \]
  \[ 81a - 81a + 8 \]
  \[ 8 \]
  Thus, the value of \( f(3) \) is \( 8 \).

  -- Substitute x = -3 into the function and simplify to find the relationship between a and b.
  have h₁ := h₀ (-3)
  -- Simplify the expression for f(-3) to get 81a - 9b + 2 = 2.
  simp at h₁
  -- Solve for b in terms of a using the simplified equation.
  have h₃ := h₀ 3
  -- Simplify the expression for f(3) to get 81a - 9b + 8.
  simp at h₃
  -- Use the relationship b = 9a to simplify the expression for f(3).
