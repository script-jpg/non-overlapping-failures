  Given the function \( f(x) = ax^4 - bx^2 + x + 5 \) and the condition \( f(-3) = 2 \), we need to determine \( f(3) \). By substituting \( x = -3 \) into the function and using the given condition, we can set up an equation to solve for the coefficients \( a \) and \( b \). Once we have these coefficients, we substitute \( x = 3 \) into the function to find \( f(3) \).

  -- Now we have the equation -a(3)^4 + b(3)^2 - 3 + 5 = 2.
  have h₁ := h₀ 3
