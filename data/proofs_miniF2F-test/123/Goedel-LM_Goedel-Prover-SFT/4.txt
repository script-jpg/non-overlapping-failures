  To find \( 24^{-1} \pmod{11^2} \), we need to determine the residue \( b \) such that \( 24b \equiv 1 \pmod{11^2} \). We will show that \( b = 116 \) satisfies this condition.
  1. Start by expressing \( b \) in terms of the inverse of 24 modulo \( 11^2 \).
  2. Compute the inverse of 24 modulo \( 11^2 \) by finding the modular inverse using the extended Euclidean algorithm.
  3. Simplify the expression to find the residue \( b \) that satisfies the congruence.
  4. Verify that \( b = 116 \) is the correct solution.
