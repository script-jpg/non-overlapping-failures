  To solve the problem of finding \(24^{-1} \pmod{11^2}\), we need to find the integer \(b\) such that \(24b \equiv 1 \pmod{11^2}\). We will show that \(b = 116\) satisfies this condition.
  1. Start by expressing \(24^{-1} \pmod{11^2}\).
  2. Use the fact that \(24 \equiv 24 \pmod{11^2}\).
  3. We need to find \(b\) such that \(24b \equiv 1 \pmod{11^2}\).
  4. By trial or using the extended Euclidean algorithm, we find that \(b = 116\) satisfies the condition.
