  To solve for \( b \) in the congruence \( 24b \equiv 1 \pmod{11^2} \), we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 24 modulo \( 11^2 \). Given that \( 11^2 = 121 \), we can use the properties of modular arithmetic to find the inverse. Specifically, we need to find \( b \) such that \( 24b \equiv 1 \pmod{121} \).
  First, we express 24 in terms of its modulo 121 components:
  \[ 24 \equiv 24 \pmod{121} \]
  Next, we need to find \( b \) such that:
  \[ 24b \equiv 1 \pmod{121} \]
  We can test values of \( b \) to find a solution. By testing \( b = 116 \), we find:
  \[ 24 \times 116 = 2784 \]
  \[ 2784 \mod 121 = 1 \]
  Thus, \( b = 116 \) satisfies the congruence \( 24b \equiv 1 \pmod{121} \).
