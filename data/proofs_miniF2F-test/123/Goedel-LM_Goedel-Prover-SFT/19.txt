  To find \(24^{-1} \pmod{11^2}\), we need to find an integer \(b\) such that \(24b \equiv 1 \pmod{11^2}\). We claim that \(b = 116\) satisfies this condition. To verify this, we substitute \(b = 116\) into the congruence and simplify.
  1. Start by substituting \(b = 116\) into the congruence \(24b \equiv 1 \pmod{11^2}\).
  2. Calculate \(24 \times 116\) and reduce modulo \(11^2\).
  3. Verify that the result is congruent to \(1 \pmod{11^2}\).
