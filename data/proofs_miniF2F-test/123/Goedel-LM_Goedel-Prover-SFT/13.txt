  To solve for \( b \) such that \( 24b \equiv 1 \pmod{11^2} \), we start by noting that \( 11^2 = 121 \). We need to find the modular inverse of 24 modulo 121. This involves finding an integer \( b \) such that \( 24b \equiv 1 \pmod{121} \). We claim that \( b = 116 \) satisfies this condition. To verify this, we compute \( 24 \times 116 \mod 121 \):
  \[
  24 \times 116 = 2784
  \]
  Next, we reduce 2784 modulo 121:
  \[
  2784 \div 121 = 23 \text{ remainder } 1
  \]
  Thus, \( 2784 \equiv 1 \pmod{121} \). Therefore, \( b = 116 \) is indeed the solution.
