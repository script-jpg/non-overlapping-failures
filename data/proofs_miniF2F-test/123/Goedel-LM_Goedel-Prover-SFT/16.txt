  To find \(24^{-1} \pmod{11^2}\), we need to solve for \(b\) in the congruence \(24b \equiv 1 \pmod{11^2}\). We start by expressing \(24^{-1}\) in terms of the modulus \(11^2\). The modulus \(11^2\) is 121, so we need to find \(b\) such that \(24b \equiv 1 \pmod{121}\).
  Given that \(24 \equiv 24 \pmod{121}\), we can use the properties of modular arithmetic to solve for \(b\). We know that \(24 \times 116 \equiv 1 \pmod{121}\), because \(24 \times 116 = 2784\) and \(2784 \equiv 1 \pmod{121}\).
  Thus, \(b = 116\) satisfies the congruence \(24b \equiv 1 \pmod{121}\).
