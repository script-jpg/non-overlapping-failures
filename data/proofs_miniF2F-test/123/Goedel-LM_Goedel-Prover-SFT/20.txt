  To find \(24^{-1} \pmod{11^2}\), we need to find the residue \(b\) such that \(24b \equiv 1 \pmod{11^2}\). We are given that \(b = 24^{-1} \pmod{11^2}\). To solve for \(b\), we can use the fact that \(24 \times 116 \equiv 1 \pmod{11^2}\). This can be verified by calculating \(24 \times 116\) and checking that it is congruent to 1 modulo \(11^2\).
