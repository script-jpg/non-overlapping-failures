  To solve the congruence \(24^{-1} \pmod{11^2}\), we need to find the integer \(b\) such that \(24b \equiv 1 \pmod{121}\). We will show that \(b = 116\) satisfies this condition.
  1. Start by expressing \(b\) in terms of the modular inverse.
  2. Verify that \(24 \times 116 \equiv 1 \pmod{121}\).
  3. Confirm that \(116\) is within the range \(0\) to \(121 - 1\).
