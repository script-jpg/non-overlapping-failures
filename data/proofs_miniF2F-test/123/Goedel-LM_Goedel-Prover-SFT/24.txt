  To find \(24^{-1} \pmod{11^2}\), we need to find an integer \(b\) such that \(24b \equiv 1 \pmod{11^2}\). We are given that \(b = 24^{-1} \pmod{11^2}\). By the properties of modular arithmetic, we know that \(24 \times 24^{-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{11^2}\). Therefore, \(b\) must be such that \(24 \times b \equiv 1 \pmod{11^2}\). This implies that \(b\) must be the modular inverse of 24 modulo \(11^2\).
  Given the constraints, we need to verify that \(b = 116\) satisfies this condition. We start by simplifying the expression using the properties of modular arithmetic. Specifically, we need to check that \(24 \times 116 \equiv 1 \pmod{121}\).
