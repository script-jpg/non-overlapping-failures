  To solve the problem of finding \(24^{-1} \pmod{11^2}\), we need to find the residue \(b\) such that \(24b \equiv 1 \pmod{11^2}\). We are given that \(b = 24^{-1} \pmod{11^2}\). We need to show that \(b = 116\).
  1. Start by expressing \(b\) in terms of the modular inverse of 24 modulo \(11^2\).
  2. Simplify the expression for \(b\) using properties of modular arithmetic.
  3. Verify that the simplified expression matches the given residue \(116\).
