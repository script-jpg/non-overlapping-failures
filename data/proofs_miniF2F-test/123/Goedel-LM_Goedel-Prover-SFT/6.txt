  To solve for \( b \) in the congruence \( 24b \equiv 1 \pmod{11^2} \), we need to find the modular inverse of 24 modulo \( 11^2 \). The modular inverse of 24 modulo \( 11^2 \) is the integer \( b \) such that \( 24b \equiv 1 \pmod{121} \). We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find this inverse.
  First, we note that \( 121 = 11^2 \). We need to find \( b \) such that:
  \[ 24b \equiv 1 \pmod{121} \]
  By the extended Euclidean algorithm, we can express 121 as a linear combination of 24 and 11. Specifically, we can write:
  \[ 121 = 24 \cdot 5 + 11 \]
  This equation implies that:
  \[ 121 \equiv 11 \pmod{24} \]
  Thus, we have:
  \[ 24b \equiv 11 \pmod{24} \]
  To solve for \( b \), we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 24 modulo 24. The inverse of 24 modulo 24 is 1, because:
  \[ 24 \cdot 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{24} \]
  Therefore, we have:
  \[ b \equiv 11 \pmod{24} \]
  Since \( b \) must be an integer between 0 and 24, the only possible value for \( b \) is 11. However, we need to verify that this value satisfies the original congruence:
  \[ 24 \cdot 11 \equiv 1 \pmod{121} \]
  Calculating \( 24 \cdot 11 \):
  \[ 24 \cdot 11 = 264 \]
  We need to check if \( 264 \equiv 1 \pmod{121} \):
  \[ 264 \div 121 = 2 \text{ remainder } 1 \]
  Thus, \( 264 \equiv 1 \pmod{121} \), confirming that \( b = 11 \) is indeed the correct solution.
