  To find \(24^{-1} \pmod{11^2}\), we need to determine the residue \(b\) such that \(24b \equiv 1 \pmod{11^2}\). We are given that \(b = 24^{-1} \pmod{11^2}\). To show that \(b = 116\), we start by expressing 116 in terms of its residue modulo \(11^2\). We then verify that \(24 \times 116 \equiv 1 \pmod{11^2}\).

  -- We start by rewriting the given congruence using the definition of modular equivalence.

  -- We use the fact that 116 is the inverse of 24 modulo 11^2 to show that 24 * 116 ≡ 1 (mod 11^2).
  rw [show (24 : ZMod (11 ^ 2)) = 24 by rfl]
  -- We use the `rfl` tactic to confirm that the expression is indeed 24.
