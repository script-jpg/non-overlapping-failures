  To solve for \( b \) in the congruence \( 24b \equiv 1 \pmod{11^2} \), we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 24 modulo \( 11^2 \). We start by expressing \( 11^2 \) as \( 121 \). The multiplicative inverse of 24 modulo 121 is a number \( b \) such that \( 24b \equiv 1 \pmod{121} \). We can solve this by finding the modular inverse using the extended Euclidean algorithm or by using the fact that \( 24 \) and \( 121 \) are coprime.
  Given the congruence \( 24b \equiv 1 \pmod{121} \), we can solve for \( b \) by finding the modular inverse of 24 modulo 121. The solution \( b \) is found to be 116.
