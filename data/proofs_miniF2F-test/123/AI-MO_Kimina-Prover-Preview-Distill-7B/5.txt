-- find the value of $24^{-1}$ mod $11^2$
  -- the answer is 116, so prove that b = 116 in the field ZMod (11^2).
  have h1 : b = 116 := by
    -- inverse of 24 mod 121 is 116, so above statement is correct.
    rw [h₀]
    native_decide
  -- above native_decide is used to find the answer.
  -- it calculates 24 * x ≡ 1 (mod 121)
  -- 24 * 116 = 2784
  -- 2784 / 121 = 23... 11
  -- so 24 * 116 ≡ 1 (mod 121)
  -- the calculate is correct, so b = 116.
