-- Find 24^{-1} \pmod{11^2}. That is, find the residue b for which 24b ≡ 1\pmod{11^2}.
  -- Express your answer as an integer from 0 to 11^2-1, inclusive. Show that it is 116.

  -- The modular multiplicative inverse of a number a modulo m is a number b such that a * b ≡ 1 (mod m).
  -- Since 24 * 116 = 2784 = 11^2 * 21 + 1, 24 * 116 ≡ 1 (mod 11^2).
  -- Therefore, the modular multiplicative inverse of 24 modulo 11^2 is 116.

  -- We need to show that b = 116 given that b = 24⁻¹ in ZMod 121.
