In this solution, we need to find the modular multiplicative inverse of 24 modulo 121. The modular multiplicative inverse of a number $a$ modulo $m$ is a number $b$ such that $a \cdot b \equiv 1 \pmod{m}$. 

To find $24^{-1} \pmod{121}$, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find integers $x$ and $y$ such that $24x + 121y = \gcd(24, 121)$. Since 24 and 121 are coprime (i.e., $\gcd(24, 121) = 1$), $x$ will be the modular inverse of 24 modulo 121.

Let's apply the extended Euclidean algorithm to 24 and 121:

1. $121 = 24 \cdot 5 + 1$
2. $24 = 1 \cdot 24 + 0$

From step 1, we have $1 = 121 - 24 \cdot 5$. Therefore, $x = -5$ is a solution for $24x \equiv 1 \pmod{121}$. 

Since we want a positive residue, we convert $-5$ to a positive equivalent by adding 121: $-5 + 121 = 116$. So $24 \cdot 116 \equiv 1 \pmod{121}$.

Hence, $24^{-1} \equiv 116 \pmod{121}$, and the answer is $\boxed{116}$.

The Lean code uses `native_decide` to automatically verify that 116 is indeed the modular inverse of 24 modulo 121. This tactic works because Lean can compute this modular arithmetic fact directly.
