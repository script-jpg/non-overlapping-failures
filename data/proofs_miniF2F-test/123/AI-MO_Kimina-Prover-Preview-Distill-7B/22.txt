-- Find $24^{-1} \pmod{11^2}$. That is, find the residue $b$ for which $24b \equiv 1\pmod{11^2}$.
  -- Express your answer as an integer from $0$ to $11^2-1$, inclusive. Show that it is 116.

  have : b = 116 := by

    -- The modular inverse of $24$ modulo $11^2$ is the unique number $b$ in the range $[0,121)$
    -- such that $24b \equiv 1 \pmod{11^2}$.

    -- Verify that $24 \cdot 116 \equiv 1 \pmod{121}$.
    -- We can write $24 \cdot 116 = 2784 = 23 \cdot 121 + 1$, so indeed $24 \cdot 116 \equiv 1 \pmod{121}$.
