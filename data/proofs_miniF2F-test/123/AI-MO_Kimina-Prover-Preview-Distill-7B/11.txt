-- Find 24^{-1} (mod 11^2). That is, find the residue b for which 24b ≡ 1 (mod 11^2).
  -- Express your answer as an integer from 0 to 11^2-1, inclusive. Show that it is 116.

  -- The problem is to find the modular multiplicative inverse of 24 modulo 121 (11^2).
  -- The modular multiplicative inverse of a modulo m is an integer x such that a*x ≡ 1 (mod m).
  -- To find the modular multiplicative inverse, we can use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
  -- First, we need to find integers x and y such that 24*x + 121*y = 1.
  -- Using the Euclidean Algorithm:
  -- gcd(121, 24) = gcd(24, 121 mod 24) = gcd(24, 1)
  -- Since 121 ≡ 1 (mod 24), we have gcd(24,1) = 1.
  -- Since gcd(24,1) = 1, 24 has a multiplicative inverse modulo 121.
  -- Working backwards in the Extended Euclidean Algorithm:
  -- 1 = 121 - 24*5
  -- Therefore, x = -5 is an inverse of 24 modulo 121.
  -- Since we want a positive residue, we can add 121 to -5 to get 116.
  -- Therefore, 24*116 ≡ 1 (mod 121).
  -- Thus, the answer is 116.
