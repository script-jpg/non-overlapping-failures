The `native_decide` tactic is powerful for computational goals. It directly computes the modular multiplicative inverse of 24 modulo 121 (since $11^2 = 121$) and verifies that it equals 116.

To understand why 116 is the answer, we can compute it manually. We need to find $b$ such that $24b \equiv 1 \pmod{121}$. This means $24b - 121k = 1$ for some integer $k$, which is a linear Diophantine equation. We can solve it using the extended Euclidean algorithm:

1. $121 = 4 \cdot 24 + 25$ (since $4 \cdot 24 = 96$ and $121 - 96 = 25$)
2. $24 = 25 - 1$ (since $25 - 1 = 24$)
3. $25 = 24 + 1$ (since $25 - 24 = 1$)
4. $24 = 24 + 0$ (since we've reached a remainder of 0)

Now, working backwards to express 1 as a linear combination of 24 and 121:
- $1 = 25 - 24$ (from step 2)
- $1 = 25 - (24)$
- $1 = 25 - (24)$
- $1 = 25 - (24)$

So $1 = 25 - 24$, which means $1 = 25 - 24$. Therefore, $24 \cdot (-1) \equiv 1 \pmod{121}$.

But we want a positive residue, so we compute $-1 + 121 = 120$. Thus $24 \cdot 120 \equiv 1 \pmod{121}$.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. $24 \cdot 120 = 2880$, and $2880 \div 121 \approx 23.8$, so $2880 = 121 \cdot 23 + 117$, which means $24 \cdot 120 \equiv 117 \pmod{121}$.

Hmm, that's not right. Let me try again. 

To find the inverse of 24 modulo 121, I should find a number $b$ such that $24b \equiv 1 \pmod{121}$. Let me try 116:
$24 \cdot 116 = 2784$, and $2784 \div 121 \approx 23.03$, so $2784 = 121 \cdot 23 + 1$. That means $24 \cdot 116 \equiv 1 \pmod{121}$, which is exactly what we want.

So the modular multiplicative inverse of 24 modulo 121 is indeed 116.

The formal Lean 4 proof is remarkably concise because Lean's computational engine can directly compute modular inverses. The key insight is that Lean represents modular arithmetic via the `ZMod` type, and the inverse operation is available as `⁻¹` just like in mathematical notation. The `native_decide` tactic then computes the actual value, confirming that 116 is indeed the correct answer.
