-- Find 24^{-1} \pmod{11^2}. That is, find the residue b for which 24b \equiv 1\pmod{11^2}.
  -- Express your answer as an integer from 0 to 11^2-1, inclusive. Show that it is 116.

  -- It suffices to show that 24*116 ≡ 1 \pmod{11^2}
  suffices 24 * 116 ≡ 1 [MOD 11^2] by
    simp [ZMod.inv_eq_iff] at h₀ ⊢
    rw [h₀]
    rfl

  -- It is enough to show that 24*116-1 is a multiple of 11^2.
  suffices 24 * 116 - 1 ≡ 0 [MOD 11^2] by
    simpa using this

  -- 24*116-1 = 2783 = 11^2 * 21 + 116
  rw [show 24 * 116 - 1 = 2783 by norm_num]
  rw [show 2783 = 11^2 * 21 + 116 by norm_num]

  -- Therefore, 24*116-1 ≡ 0 \pmod{11^2}
  exact Nat.modEq_add_fac_self (2783 - (11 ^ 2 * 21)) _
