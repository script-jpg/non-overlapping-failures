-- Find 24^{-1} \pmod{11^2}. That is, find the residue b for which 24b \equiv 1\pmod{11^2}.
  -- Express your answer as an integer from 0 to 11^2-1, inclusive. Show that it is 116.

  -- The modular inverse of a (mod m) is an integer x such that a * x ≡ 1 (mod m).
  -- This means that there exists an integer k such that a * x - m * k = 1.
  -- Therefore, we need to solve the equation 24 * x - 121 * k = 1 for integers x and k.
  have h1 : b = 116 := by
    -- We use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find integers x and y such that 24 * x + 121 * y = gcd(24, 121).
    have h2 : 24 * 116 % 121 = 1 := by decide
    -- Since gcd(24, 121) = 1, 116 is the modular inverse of 24 (mod 121).
