  Given positive integers \(a\) and \(b\), and the existence of a positive integer \(k\) such that \(2^k = (a + b^2)(b + a^2)\), we need to show that \(a = 1\).
  1. From the given existence of \(k\), we obtain \(k\) and its properties.
  2. We simplify the equation \(2^k = (a + b^2)(b + a^2)\) using basic arithmetic properties.
  3. We use the fact that \(k\) is positive and the properties of powers and multiplication to derive a contradiction if \(a \neq 1\).
  4. Specifically, we use the inequality properties to show that \(a\) must be 1.
