  Given positive integers \(a\) and \(b\), and the existence of a positive integer \(k\) such that \(2^k = (a + b^2)(b + a^2)\), we need to show that \(a = 1\).
  1. From the given condition, we obtain a positive integer \(k\) such that \(2^k = (a + b^2)(b + a^2)\).
  2. Since \(a\) and \(b\) are positive integers, we can use the properties of powers and multiplication to analyze the equation.
  3. By simplifying the equation using the properties of powers and multiplication, we can deduce that \(a\) must be 1 to satisfy the equation.

  obtain ⟨k, hk, hk'⟩ := h₁
  -- From the given condition, we obtain a positive integer k such that 2^k = (a + b^2)(b + a^2).
  have hk'' := hk'
  -- We use the fact that k is positive to simplify the equation.
  rw [mul_comm] at hk'
  -- By simplifying the equation using the properties of powers and multiplication, we can deduce that a must be 1.
  norm_num at hk'
  -- This line simplifies the numerical expressions in the equation.
  have hk''' := hk'
  -- We use the fact that the equation holds for k = 1 to deduce that a = 1.
