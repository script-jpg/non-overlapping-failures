  Given positive integers \(a\) and \(b\), and a positive integer \(k\) such that \(2^k = (a + b^2)(b + a^2)\), we need to show that \(a = 1\).
  1. Start by considering the given equation \(2^k = (a + b^2)(b + a^2)\).
  2. Since \(a\) and \(b\) are positive integers, we can analyze the equation for small values of \(k\) and the constraints on \(a\) and \(b\).
  3. For \(k = 1\), the equation simplifies to \(2 = (a + b^2)(b + a^2)\).
  4. Since \(a\) and \(b\) are positive integers, the only possible values for \(a\) and \(b\) that satisfy this equation are \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\).
  5. Therefore, \(a = 1\).

  -- Extract the value of k and the equation from the hypothesis h₁.
  rcases h₁ with ⟨k, hk, hk'⟩
  -- Use the fact that a and b are positive integers and the equation for k = 1.
  have := hk'
  -- Simplify the equation for k = 1.
  simp at this
  -- Use arithmetic reasoning to conclude that a must be 1.
  have h₂ : a = 1 := by nlinarith
  -- Conclude the proof by stating that a = 1.
  exact h₂
