  Given positive integers \(a\) and \(b\), and the existence of a positive integer \(k\) such that \(2^k = (a + b^2)(b + a^2)\), we need to show that \(a = 1\).
  1. Let \(k\) be the positive integer such that \(2^k = (a + b^2)(b + a^2)\).
  2. Extract the conditions \(0 < a\), \(0 < b\), and \(2^k = (a + b^2)(b + a^2)\) from the hypothesis \(h₁\).
  3. Normalize the equation \(2^k = (a + b^2)(b + a^2)\) using numerical simplification.
  4. Use the properties of powers and multiplication to simplify the equation.
  5. Apply algebraic inequalities to derive that \(a\) must be less than or equal to 1.
  6. Use a decision procedure to confirm that \(a = 1\).
