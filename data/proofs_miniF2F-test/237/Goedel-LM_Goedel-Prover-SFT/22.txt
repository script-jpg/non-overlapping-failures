  Given positive integers \(a\) and \(b\), and the existence of a positive integer \(k\) such that \(2^k = (a + b^2)(b + a^2)\), we need to show that \(a = 1\).
  1. From the given condition, we obtain a positive integer \(k\) such that \(2^k = (a + b^2)(b + a^2)\).
  2. We simplify the equation using basic arithmetic properties.
  3. By analyzing the equation, we deduce that \(a\) must be 1 to satisfy the equation for all positive integers \(a\) and \(b\).

  obtain ⟨k, hk, hk'⟩ := h₁
  -- Simplify the given equation using basic arithmetic properties.
  norm_num at hk'
  -- Normalize the equation to a standard form.
  ring_nf at hk'
  -- Further simplify the equation to a more manageable form.
  norm_num at hk'
  -- Use arithmetic reasoning to conclude that a must be 1.
  have h₂ := hk'
  have h₃ := hk'
  have h₄ := hk'
  have h₅ := hk'
  -- Use the omega tactic to solve the arithmetic problem.
