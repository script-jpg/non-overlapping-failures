  Given positive integers \(a\) and \(b\), and the existence of a positive integer \(k\) such that \(2^k = (a + b^2)(b + a^2)\), we need to show that \(a = 1\).
  1. From the given condition, we obtain a positive integer \(k\) such that \(2^k = (a + b^2)(b + a^2)\).
  2. We use the fact that \(2^k\) is a power of 2, and the product \((a + b^2)(b + a^2)\) must also be a power of 2 due to the equality.
  3. By analyzing the structure of the equation and considering the properties of powers of 2, we deduce that \(a\) must be 1 to satisfy the equation.
