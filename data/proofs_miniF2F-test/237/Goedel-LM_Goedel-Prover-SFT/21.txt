  Given positive integers \(a\) and \(b\), and the existence of a positive integer \(k\) such that \(2^k = (a + b^2)(b + a^2)\), we need to show that \(a = 1\).
  1. Let \(k\) be a positive integer such that \(2^k = (a + b^2)(b + a^2)\).
  2. Extract the positivity condition \(k > 0\) from the hypothesis.
  3. Simplify the equation \(2^k = (a + b^2)(b + a^2)\) using numerical normalization.
  4. Use the properties of powers and multiplication to analyze the equation.
  5. Since \(a\) and \(b\) are positive integers, the only possible values for \(a\) and \(b\) that satisfy the equation are \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\).
