  Given positive integers \(a\) and \(b\), and the existence of a positive integer \(k\) such that \(2^k = (a + b^2)(b + a^2)\), we need to show that \(a = 1\).
  1. From the given existence of \(k\), we obtain \(k\) and the equation \(2^k = (a + b^2)(b + a^2)\).
  2. We simplify the equation using properties of powers and multiplication.
  3. By analyzing the equation, we deduce that \(a\) must be 1 to satisfy the equation.
