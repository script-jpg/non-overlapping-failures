-- We are given a polynomial $f(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c$ with roots $\cos \frac{2\pi}{7}$, $\cos \frac{4\pi}{7}$, and $\cos \frac{6\pi}{7}$.
  -- We need to find the value of $abc$.

  -- First, note that $a$, $b$, and $c$ are all symmetric functions of the roots, so we can use Vieta's formulas.
  -- From Vieta's formulas, we have:
  -- $a = -(\text{sum of roots}) = -(\cos \frac{2\pi}{7} + \cos \frac{4\pi}{7} + \cos \frac{6\pi}{7})$
  -- $b = \text{sum of products of roots taken two at a time} = \cos \frac{2\pi}{7} \cos \frac{4\pi}{7} + \cos \frac{2\pi}{7} \cos \frac{6\pi}{7} + \cos \frac{4\pi}{7} \cos \frac{6\pi}{7}$
  -- $c = -(\text{product of roots}) = -(\cos \frac{2\pi}{7} \cos \frac{4\pi}{7} \cos \frac{6\pi}{7})$

  -- To find these values, we can use properties of roots of unity and some trigonometric identities.

  -- Let's start by analyzing the roots. Note that $\cos \frac{2\pi}{7}$, $\cos \frac{4\pi}{7}$, and $\cos \frac{6\pi}{7}$ are the real parts of the 7th roots of unity, excluding 1.
  -- This means they are roots of the cyclotomic polynomial $\Phi_7(x) = x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1$.
  -- Since they are roots of $x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, we can relate this to $\Phi_7(x)$.

  -- In particular, we can use the fact that $\cos \frac{2\pi}{7} + \cos \frac{4\pi}{7} + \cos \frac{6\pi}{7} = -\frac{1}{2}$ (this is a known result for the sum of cosines of angles in an arithmetic sequence).
  -- This gives us $a = -(-\frac{1}{2}) = \frac{1}{2}$.

  -- Similarly, we can find $b$ and $c$ using other trigonometric identities.
  -- We can show that $\cos \frac{2\pi}{7} \cos \frac{4\pi}{7} + \cos \frac{2\pi}{7} \cos \frac{6\pi}{7} + \cos \frac{4\pi}{7} \cos \frac{6\pi}{7} = -\frac{1}{2}$
  -- and $\cos \frac{2\pi}{7} \cos \frac{4\pi}{7} \cos \frac{6\pi}{7} = \frac{1}{8}$.

  -- Thus, $abc = \frac{1}{2} \cdot -\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{8} = -\frac{1}{32}$... Wait, this is not right. Let me recalculate.

  -- Actually, let's take a different approach. Since the roots are $\cos \frac{2\pi}{7}$, $\cos \frac{4\pi}{7}$, and $\cos \frac{6\pi}{7}$, we can use the fact that they are related to the Chebyshev polynomials.
  -- The Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind $T_3(x) = 4x^3 - 3x$ has roots $\cos \frac{2\pi}{7}$, $\cos \frac{4\pi}{7}$, and $\cos \frac{6\pi}{7}$.
  -- This means $4x^3 - 3x = 0 \Rightarrow x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.

  -- Comparing coefficients, we get $a = 0$, $b = -\frac{3}{4}$, and $c = 0$, which gives $abc = 0$, but this contradicts the answer choices.

  -- Let me think more carefully. The polynomial $x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c$ must be the minimal polynomial for $\cos \frac{2\pi}{7}$, $\cos \frac{4\pi}{7}$, and $\cos \frac{6\pi}{7}$.
  -- This means $a < 0$ (since the sum of negative numbers is negative), $b < 0$ (since the sum of products is negative), and $c > 0$ (since the product is positive).

  -- I must be making a mistake in my calculations. Let me try a more systematic approach.

  -- Using the fact that the roots are $\cos \frac{2\pi}{7}$, $\cos \frac{4\pi}{7}$, and $\cos \frac{6\pi}{7}$, we can use Vieta's formulas directly:
  -- $a = -(\cos \frac{2\pi}{7} + \cos \frac{4\pi}{7} + \cos \frac{6\pi}{7})$
  -- $b = \cos \frac{2\pi}{7} \cos \frac{4\pi}{7} + \cos \frac{2\pi}{7} \cos \frac{6\pi}{7} + \cos \frac{4\pi}{7} \cos \frac{6\pi}{7}$
  -- $c = -(\cos \frac{2\pi}{7} \cos \frac{4\pi}{7} \cos \frac{6\pi}{7})$

  -- We can compute these values using trigonometric identities:
  -- $\cos \frac{2\pi}{7} + \cos \frac{4\pi}{7} + \cos \frac{6\pi}{7} = -\frac{1}{2}$
  -- $\cos \frac{2\pi}{7} \cos \frac{4\pi}{7} + \cos \frac{2\pi}{7} \cos \frac{6\pi}{7} + \cos \frac{4\pi}{7} \cos \frac{6\pi}{7} = -\frac{1}{2}$
  -- $\cos \frac{2\pi}{7} \cos \frac{4\pi}{7} \cos \frac{6\pi}{7} = \frac{1}{8}$

  -- Thus $a = \frac{1}{2}$, $b = -\frac{1}{2}$, $c = -\frac{1}{8}$, and $abc = \frac{1}{2} \cdot -\frac{1}{2} \cdot -\frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{32}$, which is answer choice (D).

  -- Now, let's formalize this in Lean:

  have h₂ (x : ℝ) : f x = 0 ↔ x ∈ ({Real.cos (2 * Real.pi / 7), Real.cos (4 * Real.pi / 7), Real.cos (6 * Real.pi / 7)} : Set ℝ) := by
    simp [h₀]
    constructor
   . intro h
      rw [← h₁] at h
      simp at h
      exact h
   . intro h
      rw [← h₁]
      simp at h
      exact h

  -- We have established that $f(x) = 0$ if and only if $x$ is one of the three cosines. Now we can use this to determine the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$.

  have h₃ : ∀ x, f x = x ^ 3 + a * x ^ 2 + b * x + c := by exact fun x => h₀ x

  have h₄ (x : ℝ) : f x = 0 ↔ x ^ 3 + a * x ^ 2 + b * x + c = 0 := by exact h₃ x

  -- Now we can use the fact that $f(x) = 0$ if and only if $x$ is one of the three cosines to determine the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$.

  have h₅ (x : ℝ) : (f x = 0) ↔ (x ^ 3 + a * x ^ 2 + b * x + c = 0) := by
    rw [h₄ x]
    rfl

  -- Using h₅, we can now determine the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ by considering the properties of the polynomial.

  -- Since the roots are $\cos \frac{2\pi}{7}$, $\cos \frac{4\pi}{7}$, and $\cos \frac{6\pi}{7}$, we can use Vieta's formulas:
  -- $a = -(\cos \frac{2\pi}{7} + \cos \frac{4\pi}{7} + \cos \frac{6\pi}{7})$
  -- $b = \cos \frac{2\pi}{7} \cos \frac{4\pi}{7} + \cos \frac{2\pi}{7} \cos \frac{6\pi}{7} + \cos \frac{4\pi}{7} \cos \frac{6\pi}{7}$
  -- $c = -(\cos \frac{2\pi}{7} \cos \frac{4\pi}{7} \cos \frac{6\pi}{7})$

  -- We can compute these values using trigonometric identities:
  -- $\cos \frac{2\pi}{7} + \cos \frac{4\pi}{7} + \cos \frac{6\pi}{7} = -\frac{1}{2}$
  -- $\cos \frac{2\pi}{7} \cos \frac{4\pi}{7} + \cos \frac{2\pi}{7} \cos \frac{6\pi}{7} + \cos \frac{4\pi}{7} \cos \frac{6\pi}{7} = -\frac{1}{2}$
  -- $\cos \frac{2\pi}{7} \cos \frac{4\pi}{7} \cos \frac{6\pi}{7} = \frac{1}{8}$

  -- Thus $a = \frac{1}{2}$, $b = -\frac{1}{2}$, $c = -\frac{1}{8}$, and $abc = \frac{1}{2} \cdot -\frac{1}{2} \cdot -\frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{32}$

  -- Now we can complete the Lean proof by determining these values directly:

  have h₆ : (Real.cos (2 * Real.pi / 7)) ^ 3 + a * (Real.cos (2 * Real.pi / 7)) ^ 2 + b * Real.cos (2 * Real.pi / 7) + c = 0 := by
    have h₇ : Real.cos (2 * Real.pi / 7) ∈ ({Real.cos (2 * Real.pi / 7), Real.cos (4 * Real.pi / 7), Real.cos (6 * Real.pi / 7)} : Set ℝ) := by simp
    rw [h₅ (Real.cos (2 * Real.pi / 7))] at h₇
    exact h₇

  have h₈ : (Real.cos (4 * Real.pi / 7)) ^ 3 + a * (Real.cos (4 * Real.pi / 7)) ^ 2 + b * Real.cos (4 * Real.pi / 7) + c = 0 := by
    have h₉ : Real.cos (4 * Real.pi / 7) ∈ ({Real.cos (2 * Real.pi / 7), Real.cos (4 * Real.pi / 7), Real.cos (6 * Real.pi / 7)} : Set ℝ) := by simp
    rw [h₅ (Real.cos (4 * Real.pi / 7))] at h₉
    exact h₉

  have h₁₀ : (Real.cos (6 * Real.pi / 7)) ^ 3 + a * (Real.cos (6 * Real.pi / 7)) ^ 2 + b * Real.cos (6 * Real.pi / 7) + c = 0 := by
    have h₁₁ : Real.cos (6 * Real.pi / 7) ∈ ({Real.cos (2 * Real.pi / 7), Real.cos (4 * Real.pi / 7), Real.cos (6 * Real.pi / 7)} : Set ℝ) := by simp
    rw [h₅ (Real.cos (6 * Real.pi / 7))] at h₁₁
    exact h₁₁

  -- Now we have three equations:
  -- (Real.cos (2 * Real.pi / 7)) ^ 3 + a * (Real.cos (2 * Real.pi / 7)) ^ 2 + b * Real.cos (2 * Real.pi / 7) + c = 0
  -- (Real.cos (4 * Real.pi / 7)) ^ 3 + a * (Real.cos (4 * Real.pi / 7)) ^ 2 + b * Real.cos (4 * Real.pi / 7) + c = 0
  -- (Real.cos (6 * Real.pi / 7)) ^ 3 + a * (Real.cos (6 * Real.pi / 7)) ^ 2 + b * Real.cos (6 * Real.pi / 7) + c = 0

  -- These are the key equations that will allow us to determine the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$.
  -- We can solve these equations to get $abc = 1/32$.

  -- To solve these equations directly in Lean would involve a lot of algebraic manipulation and trigonometric identities.
  -- Instead, we can take a more efficient approach by leveraging known results about cyclotomic polynomials and Chebyshev polynomials.

  -- We know that $\cos \frac{2\pi}{7}$, $\cos \frac{4\pi}{7}$, and $\cos \frac{6\pi}{7}$ are the roots of the Chebyshev polynomial $T_3(x) = 4x^3 - 3x$.
  -- They are also the roots of the minimal polynomial for these cosines over the rationals.

  -- Since they are roots of $x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, we can compare with $4x^3 - 3x = 0$ to get $a = 0$, $b = -\frac{3}{4}$, $c = 0$, but this gives $abc = 0$ which is not the correct answer.

  -- This suggests that the minimal polynomial is not $4x^3 - 3x$, but a different polynomial. Let me think more carefully.

  -- Actually, let's compute the values directly. We can use the identity $\cos^3 \theta - \frac{3}{4}\cos \theta = \frac{1}{2}\cos 3\theta$.
  -- For $\theta = \frac{2\pi}{7}$, we get $\cos^3 \frac{2\pi}{7} - \frac{3}{4}\cos \frac{2\pi}{7} = \frac{1}{2}\cos \frac{6\pi}{7}$
  -- Similarly for the other angles.

  -- This gives us a system of nonlinear equations that we can solve to get the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$.

  -- Let me continue with the Lean proof:

  have h₁₂ : (Real.cos (2 * Real.pi / 7)) ^ 3 + a * (Real.cos (2 * Real.pi / 7)) ^ 2 + b * Real.cos (2 * Real.pi / 7) + c = 0 := by exact h₆
  have h₁₃ : (Real.cos (4 * Real.pi / 7)) ^ 3 + a * (Real.cos (4 * Real.pi / 7)) ^ 2 + b * Real.cos (4 * Real.pi / 7) + c = 0 := by exact h₈
  have h₁₄ : (Real.cos (6 * Real.pi / 7)) ^ 3 + a * (Real.cos (6 * Real.pi / 7)) ^ 2 + b * Real.cos (6 * Real.pi / 7) + c = 0 := by exact h₁₀

  -- Now we have three equations. To find $abc$, we can solve for $a$, $b$, and $c$ explicitly.

  -- We can use the fact that $\cos \frac{2\pi}{7} + \cos \frac{4\pi}{7} + \cos \frac{6\pi}{7} = -\frac{1}{2}$
  -- $\cos \frac{2\pi}{7} \cos \frac{4\pi}{7} + \cos \frac{2\pi}{7} \cos \frac{6\pi}{7} + \cos \frac{4\pi}{7} \cos \frac{6\pi}{7} = -\frac{1}{2}$
  -- $\cos \frac{2\pi}{7} \cos \frac{4\pi}{7} \cos \frac{6\pi}{7} = \frac{1}{8}$

  -- These give us $a = \frac{1}{2}$, $b = -\frac{1}{2}$, $c = -\frac{1}{8}$, and $abc = \frac{1}{32}$

  -- In Lean, we can solve these equations directly to get the value of $abc$:

  have h₁₅ : a * b * c = 1 / 32 := by
