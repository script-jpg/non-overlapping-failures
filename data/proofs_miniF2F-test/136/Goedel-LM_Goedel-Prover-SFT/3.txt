  Given the polynomial \( P(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c \) with roots \( \cos \frac{2\pi}{7}, \cos \frac{4\pi}{7}, \cos \frac{6\pi}{7} \), we need to determine \( abc \). The angles are in radians. We aim to show that \( abc = \frac{1}{32} \).
  First, we express the polynomial in terms of its roots:
  \[ P(x) = (x - \cos \frac{2\pi}{7})(x - \cos \frac{4\pi}{7})(x - \cos \frac{6\pi}{7}) \]
  By expanding this product, we can identify the coefficients \( a, b, \) and \( c \).
  Next, we use the fact that the roots are distinct and apply Vieta's formulas. The sum of the roots of the polynomial \( P(x) \) is given by:
  \[ -\frac{b}{a} = \cos \frac{2\pi}{7} + \cos \frac{4\pi}{7} + \cos \frac{6\pi}{7} \]
  The sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time is:
  \[ \frac{c}{a} = \cos \frac{2\pi}{7} \cos \frac{4\pi}{7} + \cos \frac{4\pi}{7} \cos \frac{6\pi}{7} + \cos \frac{6\pi}{7} \cos \frac{2\pi}{7} \]
  Finally, the product of the roots is:
  \[ -\frac{c}{a} = \cos \frac{2\pi}{7} \cos \frac{4\pi}{7} \cos \frac{6\pi}{7} \]
  Given the symmetry and the specific values of the angles, we can simplify the expressions and solve for \( a, b, \) and \( c \).
