  Given the polynomial \( P(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c \) with roots \( \cos \frac{2\pi}{7}, \cos \frac{4\pi}{7}, \cos \frac{6\pi}{7} \), we need to determine the value of \( abc \). By Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots of the polynomial \( x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \) is given by \( c \). Since the roots are \( \cos \frac{2\pi}{7}, \cos \frac{4\pi}{7}, \cos \frac{6\pi}{7} \), we can use the fact that the product of these roots is \( \cos \frac{2\pi}{7} \cdot \cos \frac{4\pi}{7} \cdot \cos \frac{6\pi}{7} \). By evaluating this product, we find that \( abc = \frac{1}{32} \).
