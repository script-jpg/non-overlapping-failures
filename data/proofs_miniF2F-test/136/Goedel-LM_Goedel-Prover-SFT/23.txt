  Given the polynomial \( P(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c \) with roots \( \cos \frac{2\pi}{7}, \cos \frac{4\pi}{7}, \cos \frac{6\pi}{7} \), we need to determine the value of \( abc \). The roots are given by the polynomial's equation, which can be manipulated to find the product of the roots. By substituting the roots into the polynomial and solving, we can derive the value of \( abc \).

  -- Simplify the given conditions using the polynomial definition
  simp only [Set.ext_iff, h₀, Set.mem_preimage, Set.mem_singleton_iff] at h₁
  -- Use the roots of the polynomial to find the product abc
  have h₂ := h₁ 0
  have h₃ := h₁ 1
  have h₄ := h₁ (-1)
  have h₅ := h₁ (Real.cos (2 * Real.pi / 7))
  have h₆ := h₁ (Real.cos (4 * Real.pi / 7))
  have h₇ := h₁ (Real.cos (6 * Real.pi / 7))
  -- Normalize the numerical values to find the exact value of abc
