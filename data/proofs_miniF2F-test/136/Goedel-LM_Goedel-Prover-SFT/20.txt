  Given the polynomial \( P(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c \) with roots \( \cos \frac{2\pi}{7}, \cos \frac{4\pi}{7}, \) and \( \cos \frac{6\pi}{7} \), we need to determine the product \( abc \).
  1. Substitute the roots into the polynomial to form a system of equations.
  2. Use the properties of the roots, specifically that they are distinct and their sum and product are related to the coefficients of the polynomial.
  3. Solve the system of equations to find the values of \( a, b, \) and \( c \).
  4. Calculate the product \( abc \) and verify that it equals \( \frac{1}{32} \).
