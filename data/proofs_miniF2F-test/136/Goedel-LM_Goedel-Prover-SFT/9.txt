  Given the polynomial \( P(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c \) with roots \( \cos \frac{2\pi}{7}, \cos \frac{4\pi}{7}, \cos \frac{6\pi}{7} \), we need to determine \( abc \).
  1. Substitute the roots into the polynomial to form equations:
     - \( (\cos \frac{2\pi}{7})^3 + a(\cos \frac{2\pi}{7})^2 + b(\cos \frac{2\pi}{7}) + c = 0 \)
     - \( (\cos \frac{4\pi}{7})^3 + a(\cos \frac{4\pi}{7})^2 + b(\cos \frac{4\pi}{7}) + c = 0 \)
     - \( (\cos \frac{6\pi}{7})^3 + a(\cos \frac{6\pi}{7})^2 + b(\cos \frac{6\pi}{7}) + c = 0 \)
  2. Use the fact that the roots are distinct and their sum is zero to simplify the equations.
  3. Solve the system of equations to find the values of \( a, b, \) and \( c \).
  4. Calculate \( abc \) and verify that it equals \( \frac{1}{32} \).
