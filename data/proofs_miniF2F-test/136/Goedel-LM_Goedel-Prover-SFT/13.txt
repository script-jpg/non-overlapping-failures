  Given the polynomial \( P(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c \) with roots \( \cos \frac{2\pi}{7}, \cos \frac{4\pi}{7}, \cos \frac{6\pi}{7} \), we need to determine \( abc \).
  1. Substitute the roots into the polynomial to form equations based on the given roots.
  2. Use the properties of the roots and the polynomial to derive relationships between the coefficients \( a, b, \) and \( c \).
  3. Simplify the derived equations to find the value of \( abc \).
