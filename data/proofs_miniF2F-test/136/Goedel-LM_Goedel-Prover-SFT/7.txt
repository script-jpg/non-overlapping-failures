  Given the polynomial \( P(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c \) with roots \( \cos \frac{2\pi}{7} \), \( \cos \frac{4\pi}{7} \), and \( \cos \frac{6\pi}{7} \), we need to determine \( abc \).
  1. Substitute the roots into the polynomial equation to form a system of equations.
  2. Use the fact that the sum of the roots is related to the coefficients of the polynomial.
  3. Simplify the resulting equations to find the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).
  4. Calculate \( abc \) using the derived values.
