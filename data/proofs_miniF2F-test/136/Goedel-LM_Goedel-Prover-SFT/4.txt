  Given the polynomial \( P(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c \) with roots \( \cos \frac{2\pi}{7} \), \( \cos \frac{4\pi}{7} \), and \( \cos \frac{6\pi}{7} \), we need to determine \( abc \).
  1. Substitute the roots into the polynomial equation to form a system of equations.
  2. Use the properties of trigonometric functions and the fact that the roots are specific values of \( \cos \frac{2\pi}{7} \), \( \cos \frac{4\pi}{7} \), and \( \cos \frac{6\pi}{7} \) to derive relationships between \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).
  3. Solve the system of equations to find the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).
  4. Calculate \( abc \) and verify that it equals \( \frac{1}{32} \).
