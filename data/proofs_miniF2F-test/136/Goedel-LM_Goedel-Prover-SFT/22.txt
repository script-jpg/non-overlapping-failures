  Given the polynomial \( P(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c \) with roots \( \cos \frac{2\pi}{7} \), \( \cos \frac{4\pi}{7} \), and \( \cos \frac{6\pi}{7} \), we need to determine \( abc \).
  First, we express the polynomial in terms of its roots and coefficients. Since the roots are \( \cos \frac{2\pi}{7} \), \( \cos \frac{4\pi}{7} \), and \( \cos \frac{6\pi}{7} \), we can use the fact that the polynomial can be written as:
  \[ P(x) = x^3 + a x^2 + b x + c \]
  Given that \( x_1 = \cos \frac{2\pi}{7} \), \( x_2 = \cos \frac{4\pi}{7} \), and \( x_3 = \cos \frac{6\pi}{7} \), we know that:
  \[ P(x_1) = 0, \quad P(x_2) = 0, \quad P(x_3) = 0 \]
  Thus, we have:
  \[ x_1^3 + a x_1^2 + b x_1 + c = 0 \]
  \[ x_2^3 + a x_2^2 + b x_2 + c = 0 \]
  \[ x_3^3 + a x_3^2 + b x_3 + c = 0 \]
  To find \( abc \), we use the fact that the polynomial can be solved for the roots and coefficients. By substituting the roots into the polynomial and solving the resulting system of equations, we can determine the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).
  Given the symmetry and the nature of the roots, we can simplify the problem by recognizing that the roots are roots of the polynomial. By using the properties of the roots and the polynomial, we can derive that:
  \[ abc = \frac{1}{32} \]
