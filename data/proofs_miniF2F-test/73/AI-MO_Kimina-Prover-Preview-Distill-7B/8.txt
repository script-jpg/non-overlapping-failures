The Lean 4 proof is remarkably concise because the problem is primarily computational. Let's break down what's happening in this proof:

1. We need to convert the number $852_9$ from base 9 to base 10.
2. In base 9, the number $852_9$ represents $8 \cdot 9^2 + 5 \cdot 9 + 2$.
3. We calculate:
   - $8 \cdot 9^2 = 8 \cdot 81 = 648$
   - $5 \cdot 9 = 45$
   - $2 = 2$
4. Adding these together: $648 + 45 + 2 = 695$
5. Therefore, $852_9$ in base 10 is $695$.

The Lean 4 proof uses the `norm_num` tactic, which is powerful for solving arithmetic goals. It automatically computes the arithmetic expression on the left-hand side and checks that it equals 695.

So our complete formal Lean 4 proof is:

```tactics

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

theorem mathd_numbertheory_207 : 8 * 9 ^ 2 + 5 * 9 + 2 = 695 := by
  norm_num
```

The theorem statement precisely captures the mathematical claim, and the proof is handled efficiently by Lean's computational capabilities.

In conclusion, we've shown that the base 9 number $852_9$ converts to $695$ in base 10.
