-- Direct calculation shows that $852_9$ is $8 \cdot 9^2 + 5 \cdot 9 + 2 = 695$. The goal follows.

  norm_num
```

This completes the proof that $852_9 = 695_{10}$.

The key insight is that $852_9$ is a base-9 number, which means:
- The rightmost digit (2) is in the $9^0$ place
- The middle digit (5) is in the $9^1$ place
- The leftmost digit (8) is in the $9^2$ place

So we calculate:
$852_9 = 8 \cdot 9^2 + 5 \cdot 9 + 2$
$= 8 \cdot 81 + 5 \cdot 9 + 2$
$= 648 + 45 + 2$
$= 695$

The Lean proof performs this calculation directly using `norm_num`, which is powerful enough to evaluate arithmetic expressions.
