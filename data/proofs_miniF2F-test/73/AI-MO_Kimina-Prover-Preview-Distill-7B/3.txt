The proof is a simple base conversion and arithmetic calculation. We interpret the number $852_9$ as:

- The rightmost digit '2' is in the $9^0$ (units) place, contributing $2 \times 9^0 = 2$.
- The middle digit '5' is in the $9^1$ (nines place) contributing $5 \times 9^1 = 45$.
- The leftmost digit '8' is in the $9^2$ (ninety-nines place) contributing $8 \times 9^2 = 648$.

Adding these contributions together: $648 + 45 + 2 = 695$.

The Lean proof directly evaluates this arithmetic expression:

```tactics

We start by importing the necessary libraries and setting up the theorem statement. The theorem states that the base 10 value of $852_9$ is 695:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_207 : 8 * 9 ^ 2 + 5 * 9 + 2 = 695 := by
```

Now we need to prove this equality. This is a direct arithmetic computation, so Lean's `norm_num` tactic should be able to handle it automatically:

```tactics
norm_num
```

The `norm_num` tactic performs numerical calculations and simplifications. It will:
1. Calculate $9^2 = 81$
2. Multiply by 8: $8 \times 81 = 648$
3. Calculate $5 \times 9 = 45$
4. Add all parts: $648 + 45 + 2 = 695$

Therefore, the proof is complete, confirming that $852_9$ is indeed 695 in base 10.
