norm_num

```

The `norm_num` tactic is powerful for solving arithmetic goals involving concrete numbers. It will compute the value of $852_9$ by expanding it as $8 \cdot 9^2 + 5 \cdot 9 + 2$ and verifying that it equals 695.

To understand why $852_9 = 695$, let's compute it manually:
- $852_9 = 8 \cdot 9^2 + 5 \cdot 9 + 2$
- $9^2 = 81$
- $8 \cdot 81 = 648$
- $5 \cdot 9 = 45$
- $648 + 45 + 2 = 695$

So indeed, $852_9 = 695_{10}$.

The Lean proof is remarkably concise because the problem is purely computational with concrete values. The `norm_num` tactic handles all the arithmetic, proving that $8 \cdot 9^2 + 5 \cdot 9 + 2 = 695$ directly.

Therefore, the final answer is $\boxed{695}$.
