I'll solve the problem of converting $852_9$ to base 10 and proving it equals 695. First, let me understand what $852_9$ means in base 9.

The number $852_9$ is represented in base 9, which means:
- The rightmost digit '2' is in the $9^0$ (units) place
- The middle digit '5' is in the $9^1$ (nines place)
- The leftmost digit '8' is in the $9^2$ (eighty-ones place)

To convert to base 10, we calculate:
$852_9 = 8 \cdot 9^2 + 5 \cdot 9^1 + 2 \cdot 9^0$

Let's compute each term:
- $8 \cdot 9^2 = 8 \cdot 81 = 648$
- $5 \cdot 9^1 = 5 \cdot 9 = 45$
- $2 \cdot 9^0 = 2 \cdot 1 = 2$

Adding these together gives us $648 + 45 + 2 = 695$.

Now, let's formalize this in Lean 4. We need to prove that $8 \cdot 9^2 + 5 \cdot 9 + 2 = 695$.

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

Next, we'll define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_207 : 8 * 9 ^ 2 + 5 * 9 + 2 = 695 := by
```

Now we need to prove this equality. In Lean, we can use the `norm_num` tactic to compute arithmetic goals involving concrete numbers:

```tactics
norm_num
```

The `norm_num` tactic will compute the value of $8 \cdot 9^2 + 5 \cdot 9 + 2$ directly and check that it equals 695. It performs the calculations I described above:
- $9^2 = 81$
- $8 \cdot 81 = 648$
- $5 \cdot 9 = 45$
- $648 + 45 + 2 = 695$

So our complete proof is:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat

theorem mathd_numbertheory_207 : 8 * 9 ^ 2 + 5 * 9 + 2 = 695 := by
  norm_num
```

This elegant proof leverages Lean's automation to compute the arithmetic expression directly, confirming that $852_9$ is indeed 695 in base 10.
