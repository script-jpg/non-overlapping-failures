This Lean 4 proof is used to convert the number $852_9$ from base 9 to base 10 and verify that it equals 695. In base 9, the number $852_9$ represents:

- The rightmost digit '2' is in the $9^0$ (units) place: $2 \times 9^0 = 2 \times 1 = 2$
- The middle digit '5' is in the $9^1$ (nines place): $5 \times 9^1 = 5 \times 9 = 45$
- The leftmost digit '8' is in the $9^2$ (eighty-ones place): $8 \times 9^2 = 8 \times 81 = 648$

Adding these together: $648 + 45 + 2 = 695$

The `norm_num` tactic in Lean 4 is powerful for arithmetic calculations. It automatically handles the computation of $8 \times 9^2 + 5 \times 9 + 2$ and verifies that it equals 695. This tactic expands the expression by calculating each power of 9, multiplying by the corresponding digits, and then summing the results, just as we would do manually.

So our complete proof is:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

We've imported the necessary libraries and set up the basic framework. The `maxHeartbeats 0` option allows Lean to work with large proofs without timing out.

Now we state the theorem:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_207 : 8 * 9 ^ 2 + 5 * 9 + 2 = 695 := by
```

We have our theorem statement. Now we need to prove it. The `norm_num` tactic is perfect for this kind of arithmetic verification:

```tactics
norm_num
```

This single tactic completes the proof by performing the arithmetic calculation. Lean's `norm_num` is capable of evaluating constant arithmetic expressions and checking equalities between them. It effectively computes $8 \times 9^2 + 5 \times 9 + 2$ and confirms it equals 695.

The proof is now complete. The Lean proof is remarkably concise because Lean's automation can handle simple arithmetic calculations like this one. In a more complex proof, we might need additional tactics, but for direct arithmetic verification, `norm_num` is the ideal choice.
