norm_num

```

The `norm_num` tactic is powerful enough to compute arithmetic expressions and verify equalities between concrete numbers. In this case, it will compute $8 \cdot 9^2 + 5 \cdot 9 + 2$ by evaluating each term:
- $9^2 = 81$
- $8 \cdot 81 = 648$
- $5 \cdot 9 = 45$
- $648 + 45 + 2 = 695$

After computing this, `norm_num` will verify that $695 = 695$, which is trivially true.

Therefore, our complete proof is:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

We've imported the necessary libraries and opened namespaces for working with mathematical operations. The `maxHeartbeats` setting is increased to allow more complex proof steps, though in this case, the proof is quite straightforward.

Now we define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_207 : 8 * 9 ^ 2 + 5 * 9 + 2 = 695 := by
  norm_num
```

This theorem states that the base 9 number $852_9$ (which we convert to base 10) equals 695. The `norm_num` tactic is sufficient to prove this equality directly by computation.

In conclusion, we have shown that $852_9 = 8 \cdot 9^2 + 5 \cdot 9 + 2 = 695_{10}$.
