We've just converted the number $852_9$ from base 9 to base 10. Let's verify this by calculation:

- $852_9 = 8 \cdot 9^2 + 5 \cdot 9 + 2$
- $= 8 \cdot 81 + 5 \cdot 9 + 2$
- $= 648 + 45 + 2$
- $= 695$

The Lean proof is remarkably concise because Lean's computational engine can automatically verify this equality with the `norm_num` tactic, which is powerful enough to compute arithmetic expressions involving natural numbers.

Now, let's move on to the next part of the problem.

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

These imports and opens give us access to Lean's mathematical libraries and the necessary notation. The `maxHeartbeats 0` option allows Lean to perform computations without limits on the number of steps, which is useful for arithmetic calculations.

Now, let's define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_207 : 8 * 9 ^ 2 + 5 * 9 + 2 = 695 := by
```

And complete the proof with:

```tactics
norm_num
```

The theorem statement directly encodes the mathematical claim: that the base 10 value of $852_9$ is 695. The proof is completed by `norm_num`, which Lean uses to compute the arithmetic expression on the left-hand side and verify it equals 695.

So we've successfully proved that $852_9 = 695_{10}$ in Lean 4. The proof is elegant in its simplicity, leveraging Lean's computational capabilities to verify the equality directly. This is a great example of how formal verification systems can handle basic arithmetic facts with minimal ceremony.
