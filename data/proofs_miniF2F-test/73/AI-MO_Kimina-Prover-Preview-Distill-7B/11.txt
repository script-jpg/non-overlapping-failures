-- The left hand side is 8*9^2+5*9+2.
  -- It is equal to 695 by calculation.

This Lean 4 proof is converting the base 9 number $852_9$ to base 10 and showing that it equals 695. In base 9, the number $852_9$ represents $8 \cdot 9^2 + 5 \cdot 9 + 2$. We calculate:

- $9^2 = 81$
- $8 \cdot 81 = 648$
- $5 \cdot 9 = 45$
- $648 + 45 + 2 = 695$

So indeed, $852_9$ in base 10 is $695$.

The Lean proof is very concise. It simply states the equality and proves it by calculation using `norm_num`:

import Mathlib
import Aesop

We're importing the necessary libraries, setting an option to allow more complex proof steps, and opening namespaces for various mathematical components.

Now, let's define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_207 : 8 * 9 ^ 2 + 5 * 9 + 2 = 695 := by
```

So far, we've declared the theorem stating that $8 \cdot 9^2 + 5 \cdot 9 + 2 = 695$. Now we need to prove it. Since this is a direct calculation, Lean's `norm_num` tactic is perfect for the job:

```tactics
norm_num
```

The `norm_num` tactic in Lean is powerful for solving arithmetic goals. It performs numerical calculations and simplifications automatically. In this case, it computes $8 \cdot 9^2 + 5 \cdot 9 + 2$ directly:

- $9^2 = 81$
- $8 \cdot 81 = 648$
- $5 \cdot 9 = 45$
- $648 + 45 + 2 = 695$

After computing this, `norm_num` verifies that $695 = 695$, which is trivially true. This completes our proof.

In conclusion, we have formally verified that the base 9 number $852_9$ converts to $695$ in base 10.
