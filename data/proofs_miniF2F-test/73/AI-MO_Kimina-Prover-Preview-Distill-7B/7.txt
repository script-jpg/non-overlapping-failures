This theorem is about converting the number $852_9$ from base 9 to base 10 and proving it equals 695. In base 9, the number $852_9$ represents $8 \cdot 9^2 + 5 \cdot 9 + 2$.

Let's compute this step by step:
- $8 \cdot 9^2 = 8 \cdot 81 = 648$
- $5 \cdot 9 = 45$
- $648 + 45 + 2 = 695$

The Lean proof is quite straightforward. We need to show that the expression $8 \cdot 9^2 + 5 \cdot 9 + 2$ evaluates to 695. 

The `norm_num` tactic is powerful for arithmetic goals. It automatically handles numerical calculations, arithmetic operations, and can verify equalities between concrete numbers. In this case, it will compute $8 \cdot 9^2 + 5 \cdot 9 + 2$ and check that it equals 695.

So, our complete Lean 4 proof is:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

We've imported the necessary libraries and opened namespaces for working with arithmetic. The `maxHeartbeats 0` option allows Lean to use as many computational steps as needed, which is useful for arithmetic calculations that might be computationally intensive (though in this case, it's quite simple).

Now, let's define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_207 : 8 * 9 ^ 2 + 5 * 9 + 2 = 695 := by 
  norm_num
```

The theorem statement correctly represents $852_9$ as $8 \cdot 9^2 + 5 \cdot 9 + 2$ in base 10, and the `norm_num` tactic is able to compute this arithmetic expression and verify that it equals 695.

Therefore, the Lean proof confirms that $852_9$ is indeed 695 in base 10.
