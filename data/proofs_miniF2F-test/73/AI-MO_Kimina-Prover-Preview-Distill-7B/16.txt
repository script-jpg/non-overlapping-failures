This Lean theorem statement is asking us to prove that the base 9 number $852_9$ converts to 695 in base 10. The theorem statement $8 * 9 ^ 2 + 5 * 9 + 2 = 695$ is precisely the mathematical expression needed to verify this base conversion.

To understand this conversion manually:
- $852_9$ means $8 \cdot 9^2 + 5 \cdot 9^1 + 2 \cdot 9^0$
- This is $8 \cdot 81 + 5 \cdot 9 + 2 \cdot 1$
- Which is $648 + 45 + 2 = 695$

The Lean proof is remarkably concise because Lean's computational capabilities can directly evaluate this arithmetic expression. The `norm_num` tactic is powerful for goals involving concrete natural numbers and arithmetic operations. It will compute each part of the expression:
- $9^2 = 81$
- $8 \cdot 81 = 648$
- $5 \cdot 9 = 45$
- $648 + 45 + 2 = 695$

After computing all these steps, Lean confirms that indeed $8 \cdot 9^2 + 5 \cdot 9 + 2 = 695$, completing the proof.

The complete Lean 4 proof is:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

These imports and options are setting up the Lean environment to work with mathematical libraries. The `maxHeartbeats 0` option allows Lean to use as many computational resources as needed for this proof.

Now for the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_207 : 8 * 9 ^ 2 + 5 * 9 + 2 = 695 := by
  norm_num
```

The theorem directly states the equality we want to prove. The `norm_num` tactic is Lean's workhorse for solving arithmetic goals. It will:
1. Compute $9^2 = 81$
2. Multiply by 8 to get $648$
3. Compute $5 \cdot 9 = 45$
4. Add $648 + 45 + 2 = 695$
5. Verify that $695 = 695$ is true

The beauty of Lean is that for computational facts like this, the proof is incredibly simple. The formal verification directly reflects the mathematical reasoning we would do by hand. The `norm_num` tactic is powerful enough to handle all the arithmetic operations involved in evaluating the base conversion expression.

In conclusion, this Lean proof formally confirms that the base 9 number $852_9$ is indeed equal to 695 in base 10, matching our manual calculation.
