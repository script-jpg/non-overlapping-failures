-- Convert $852_9$ to base 10, showing it equals 695.

  -- First, understand what $852_9$ means in base 9. This represents:
  -- $8 \cdot 9^2 + 5 \cdot 9^1 + 2 \cdot 9^0$

  -- Calculate each term:
  -- $8 \cdot 9^2 = 8 \cdot 81 = 648$
  -- $5 \cdot 9^1 = 5 \cdot 9 = 45$
  -- $2 \cdot 9^0 = 2 \cdot 1 = 2$

  -- Adding these up: $648 + 45 + 2 = 695$

This Lean proof is remarkably concise because the calculation is purely arithmetic and can be directly computed by Lean's `norm_num` tactic, which is powerful for solving goals involving concrete numbers.

The theorem statement `mathd_numbertheory_207 : 8 * 9 ^ 2 + 5 * 9 + 2 = 695` directly represents the mathematical claim that $852_9$ in base 10 is 695. The `norm_num` tactic is able to evaluate the left-hand side and verify it equals 695.

To expand on the calculation:
- $8 \cdot 9^2 = 8 \cdot 81 = 648$
- $5 \cdot 9^1 = 5 \cdot 9 = 45$
- $2 \cdot 9^0 = 2 \cdot 1 = 2$
- Sum: $648 + 45 + 2 = 695$

The proof is complete with just the `norm_num` tactic because:
1. It handles arithmetic calculations with concrete values
2. It can compute powers (like $9^2$)
3. It performs the multiplications and additions
4. It verifies that the result equals 695

Therefore, the proof is fully automated, and the solution is indeed 695.
