This Lean 4 proof is converting the number $852_9$ from base 9 to base 10 and verifying that it equals 695. Let's break down the mathematical reasoning first:

The number $852_9$ is represented in base 9. To convert it to base 10, we need to expand it as:
$852_9 = 8 \cdot 9^2 + 5 \cdot 9 + 2$

Now let's compute each term:
- $8 \cdot 9^2 = 8 \cdot 81 = 648$
- $5 \cdot 9 = 45$
- $2 = 2$

Adding these up: $648 + 45 + 2 = 695$

In Lean 4, the proof is remarkably concise:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

These imports and opens are setting up the necessary libraries for working with arithmetic operations. The `maxHeartbeats 0` option is ensuring that Lean's automation will work as hard as it needs to, without any limits.

Now we can state the theorem:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_207 : 8 * 9 ^ 2 + 5 * 9 + 2 = 695 := by
```

We have stated the theorem precisely as required. Now we need to prove that $8 \cdot 9^2 + 5 \cdot 9 + 2 = 695$. This is a direct arithmetic computation that Lean's `norm_num` tactic can solve:

```tactics
norm_num
```

The `norm_num` tactic is powerful for solving arithmetic goals. It automatically:
1. Computes $9^2 = 81$
2. Calculates $8 \cdot 81 = 648$
3. Calculates $5 \cdot 9 = 45$
4. Adds $648 + 45 + 2 = 695$

After these computations, Lean verifies that the left-hand side of our equation indeed equals 695, completing the proof.

In conclusion, the Lean 4 proof is elegant in its simplicity. It directly represents the mathematical operation of converting $852_9$ to base 10, and Lean's automation is able to compute the result directly. This demonstrates how Lean can be used to verify concrete arithmetic calculations, which is particularly useful for problems where the computation is straightforward but tedious for humans.
