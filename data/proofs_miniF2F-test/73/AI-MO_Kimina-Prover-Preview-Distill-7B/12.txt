# Solving the Base Conversion Problem in Lean 4

To solve the problem of converting the number $852_9$ from base 9 to base 10 and proving it equals 695, we need to compute $8 \cdot 9^2 + 5 \cdot 9 + 2$ and verify this equals 695. Let's compute this step by step:

First, we compute $9^2 = 81$.
Then, $8 \cdot 81 = 648$
Next, $5 \cdot 9 = 45$
Adding these together with $2$: $648 + 45 + 2 = 695$

Now, we'll translate this into Lean 4 code. We need to prove that $8 \cdot 9^2 + 5 \cdot 9 + 2 = 695$ using Lean's proof capabilities.

The formal Lean 4 solution would look like this:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

We've imported the necessary libraries, set the maximum number of proof steps to unlimited (which is appropriate for simple arithmetic calculations), and opened the namespaces for various mathematical components.

Now, we'll define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_207 : 8 * 9 ^ 2 + 5 * 9 + 2 = 695 := by
```

We have the theorem statement with the arithmetic expression on the left and the claimed result on the right. To prove this, Lean can directly compute the arithmetic expression using the `norm_num` tactic:

```tactics
norm_num
```

The `norm_num` tactic is powerful enough to compute arithmetic expressions involving natural numbers, integers, and other numeric types. It will evaluate $8 \cdot 9^2 + 5 \cdot 9 + 2$ directly:
- $9^2 = 81$
- $8 \cdot 81 = 648$
- $5 \cdot 9 = 45$
- $648 + 45 + 2 = 695$

After computing this, `norm_num` will check that the result equals 695, which is true, and complete the proof.

Therefore, the complete proof shows that $852_9$ in base 10 is indeed 695, as required.
