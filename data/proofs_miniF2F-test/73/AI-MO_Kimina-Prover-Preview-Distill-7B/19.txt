# Solving the Base Conversion Problem

I'm going to tackle a problem about converting a number from base 9 to base 10 and verifying it equals 695. Let's analyze what we need to prove: that the number $852_9$ is 695 in base 10.

First, let's understand what $852_9$ means in base 9:
- The rightmost digit is 2, which represents $2 \times 9^0 = 2$
- The middle digit is 5, which represents $5 \times 9^1 = 45$
- The leftmost digit is 8, which represents $8 \times 9^2 = 8 \times 81 = 648$

Adding these up: $648 + 45 + 2 = 695$

Now let's think about how to structure the formal proof in Lean 4. We'll need to:
1. Express the base conversion as a mathematical formula
2. Verify that the formula equals 695
3. Use Lean's computation capabilities to evaluate the arithmetic

Let's start by importing the necessary libraries:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

We've imported Mathlib and Aesop, which will give us access to the necessary definitions and tactics for working with natural numbers and arithmetic. The `maxHeartbeats 0` setting allows Lean to perform computations without limits, and we've opened several namespaces for convenient access to their definitions.

Now, let's define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_207 : 8 * 9 ^ 2 + 5 * 9 + 2 = 695 := by
```

We've successfully stated the theorem. The left-hand side represents $852_9$ in base 10: $8 \times 9^2 + 5 \times 9 + 2$. Now we need to prove this equals 695.

To complete the proof, we simply need to evaluate the arithmetic expression. Lean has powerful computation capabilities that can directly solve this kind of arithmetic goal:

```tactics
norm_num
```

The `norm_num` tactic is perfect for this problem. It automatically simplifies arithmetic expressions and can verify that $8 \times 9^2 + 5 \times 9 + 2 = 695$. The tactic computes:
- $9^2 = 81$
- $8 \times 81 = 648$
- $5 \times 9 = 45$
- $648 + 45 + 2 = 695$

This completes our proof. The key insight was recognizing how to express the base conversion as a mathematical formula, and Lean's `norm_num` tactic was able to directly compute the result.

Therefore, we've formally verified that $852_9$ is indeed 695 in base 10.
