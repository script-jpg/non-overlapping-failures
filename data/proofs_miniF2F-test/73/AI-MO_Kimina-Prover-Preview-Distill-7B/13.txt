The Lean 4 proof is remarkably concise. We state the theorem as `8 * 9 ^ 2 + 5 * 9 + 2 = 695`, which is the mathematical representation of converting $852_9$ to base 10. Then we use `norm_num` to automatically compute that $8 \cdot 9^2 + 5 \cdot 9 + 2$ indeed equals $695$.

The key insight is that the number $852_9$ is represented in base 9, so:
- The rightmost digit '2' is in the $9^0$ (units) place
- The middle digit '5' is in the $9^1$ (nines place)
- The leftmost digit '8' is in the $9^2$ (eighty-ones place)

So $852_9 = 8 \cdot 9^2 + 5 \cdot 9 + 2$.

Let me compute this manually to verify:
- $9^2 = 81$
- $8 \cdot 81 = 648$
- $5 \cdot 9 = 45$
- $648 + 45 + 2 = 695$

So $852_9 = 695_{10}$, which is indeed true.

The Lean proof is elegant because it directly represents the mathematical operation needed to convert between bases, and Lean's computational engine (`norm_num`) can verify this equality automatically. This demonstrates how Lean can be used to verify simple mathematical facts with complete rigor.
