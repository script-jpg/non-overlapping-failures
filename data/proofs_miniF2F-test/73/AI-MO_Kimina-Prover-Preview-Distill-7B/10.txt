The Lean proof is remarkably concise. It simply converts the base 9 number to base 10 and checks that it equals 695. Lean's `norm_num` tactic is powerful enough to compute this directly.

To understand why $852_9 = 695_{10}$, we can break it down as follows:
- The base 9 number $852_9$ represents $8 \cdot 9^2 + 5 \cdot 9 + 2$ in base 10.
- Calculating each term:
  - $8 \cdot 9^2 = 8 \cdot 81 = 648$
  - $5 \cdot 9 = 45$
  - $2 = 2$
- Summing these gives $648 + 45 + 2 = 695$.

Therefore, the Lean proof is complete and demonstrates that $852_9$ is indeed $695_{10}$.
