-- An easy computation shows that $852_9=8\cdot9^2+5\cdot9+2=695$.

This Lean 4 proof is converting the number $852_9$ from base 9 to base 10 and verifying that it equals 695. The number $852_9$ is represented as $8 \cdot 9^2 + 5 \cdot 9 + 2$ in base 10. The Lean proof uses the `norm_num` tactic to compute this arithmetic expression directly. 

First, compute $9^2 = 81$. Then:
- $8 \cdot 81 = 648$
- $5 \cdot 9 = 45$
- $648 + 45 + 2 = 695$

The `norm_num` tactic is powerful enough to compute these calculations automatically. It will evaluate the arithmetic expression on the left-hand side and check that it equals 695, thus proving the goal.

The complete Lean 4 proof is remarkably concise because Lean's automation can handle arithmetic computations directly. This is a simple calculation that Lean can verify without requiring further proof steps. The beauty of formal verification is that even simple arithmetic can be checked with absolute certainty, which is especially useful in more complex proofs where such calculations might be error-prone for humans.

Therefore, the Lean 4 proof confirms that $852_9 = 695_{10}$.
