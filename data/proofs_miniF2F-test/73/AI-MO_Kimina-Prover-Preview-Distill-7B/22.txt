This theorem statement is converting the number $852_9$ from base 9 to base 10. In base 9, the number $852_9$ represents:

- The rightmost digit '2' is in the $9^0$ (units) place: $2 \times 9^0 = 2 \times 1 = 2$
- The middle digit '5' is in the $9^1$ (nines place): $5 \times 9^1 = 5 \times 9 = 45$
- The leftmost digit '8' is in the $9^2$ (ninety-nines place): $8 \times 9^2 = 8 \times 81 = 648$

Adding these together: $648 + 45 + 2 = 695$

The `norm_num` tactic is powerful for arithmetic calculations. It will compute each term:
- $9^2 = 81$
- $8 \times 81 = 648$
- $5 \times 9 = 45$
- $648 + 45 + 2 = 695$

And it will verify that indeed $8 \times 9^2 + 5 \times 9 + 2 = 695$.

So our complete proof is:

We've imported the necessary libraries and opened namespaces to access mathematical definitions and theorems.

Now, let's state the theorem:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_207 : 8 * 9 ^ 2 + 5 * 9 + 2 = 695 := by
  norm_num
```

The theorem statement declares exactly what we want to prove: that the base 10 representation of $852_9$ is 695. The `norm_num` tactic is then used to automatically verify this equality through arithmetic computation.

In conclusion, we've successfully proved that the base 10 representation of the base 9 number $852_9$ is indeed 695. The `norm_num` tactic handled all the arithmetic calculations for us, confirming that $8 \times 9^2 + 5 \times 9 + 2 = 695$.
