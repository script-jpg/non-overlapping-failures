The final answer is $ \boxed{695} $.

This Lean 4 proof is converting the number $852_9$ from base 9 to base 10, and verifying that it equals 695. 

To understand this conversion, we need to expand $852_9$ in terms of powers of 9:
- The rightmost digit is 2, which represents $2 \times 9^0 = 2$
- The middle digit is 5, which represents $5 \times 9^1 = 45$
- The leftmost digit is 8, which represents $8 \times 9^2 = 8 \times 81 = 648$

Adding these together: $648 + 45 + 2 = 695$

In Lean 4, we express this as:
```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

We've imported the necessary libraries and set up the environment. The `maxHeartbeats 0` option allows Lean to work with large proofs without running out of resources.

Now we'll define the theorem statement:
```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_207 : 8 * 9 ^ 2 + 5 * 9 + 2 = 695 := by
```

We've declared the theorem with the appropriate mathematical expression. Now we need to prove it. Lean can verify this equality directly using computational methods:

```tactics
norm_num
```

The `norm_num` tactic is powerful for arithmetic goals. It will:
1. Compute $9^2 = 81$
2. Multiply by 8: $8 \times 81 = 648$
3. Compute $5 \times 9 = 45$
4. Sum all terms: $648 + 45 + 2 = 695$

This completes our proof. The Lean 4 system verifies that $8 \times 9^2 + 5 \times 9 + 2$ indeed equals 695, confirming that the base 10 representation of $852_9$ is 695.
