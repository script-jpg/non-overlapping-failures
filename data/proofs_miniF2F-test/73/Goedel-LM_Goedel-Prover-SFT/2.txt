  To convert the number \(852_9\) to base 10 and show that it equals 695, we start by expressing \(852_9\) in its expanded form in base 10. The number \(852_9\) can be written as:
  \[ 8 \cdot 9^2 + 5 \cdot 9 + 2 \]
  We then compute each term individually:
  \[ 8 \cdot 9^2 = 8 \cdot 81 = 648 \]
  \[ 5 \cdot 9 = 45 \]
  Adding these results together:
  \[ 648 + 45 + 2 = 695 \]
  Thus, the number \(852_9\) in base 10 is indeed 695.
