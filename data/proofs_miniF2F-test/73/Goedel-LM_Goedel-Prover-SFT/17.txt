  To convert the number \(852_9\) to base 10 and show that it equals 695, we start by expressing \(852_9\) in terms of its digits and powers of 9. Specifically, we have:
  \[ 852_9 = 8 \cdot 9^2 + 5 \cdot 9 + 2 \]
  Next, we compute each term individually:
  \[ 8 \cdot 9^2 = 8 \cdot 81 = 648 \]
  \[ 5 \cdot 9 = 45 \]
  \[ 2 = 2 \]
  Adding these values together:
  \[ 648 + 45 + 2 = 695 \]
  Thus, we have shown that \(852_9 = 695\).
