  To convert the number \(852_9\) to base 10, we need to evaluate the expression \(8 \cdot 9^2 + 5 \cdot 9 + 2\). We can break down the calculation as follows:
  1. Calculate \(9^2\):
     \[
     9^2 = 81
     \]
  2. Multiply 8 by 81:
     \[
     8 \cdot 81 = 648
     \]
  3. Calculate \(5 \cdot 9\):
     \[
     5 \cdot 9 = 45
     \]
  4. Add the results from steps 2 and 3:
     \[
     648 + 45 = 693
     \]
  5. Add 2 to the result from step 4:
     \[
     693 + 2 = 695
     \]
  Thus, the base 10 equivalent of \(852_9\) is \(695\).
