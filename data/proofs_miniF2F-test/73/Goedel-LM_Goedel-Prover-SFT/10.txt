  To convert the number \(852_9\) to base 10 and show that it equals 695, we start by expressing \(852_9\) in its expanded form:
  \[ 8 \cdot 9^2 + 5 \cdot 9 + 2 \]
  First, we calculate each term separately:
  \[ 8 \cdot 9^2 = 8 \cdot 81 = 648 \]
  \[ 5 \cdot 9 = 5 \cdot 9 = 45 \]
  Adding these results together with the constant term 2:
  \[ 648 + 45 + 2 = 695 \]
  Thus, the number \(852_9\) in base 10 is indeed 695.
  -/
  -- Expand the number in base 9 to its base 10 equivalent.
  -- The number 852_9 is expanded as 8 * 9^2 + 5 * 9 + 2.
  norm_num
  -- Use the `norm_num` tactic to verify the numerical calculation.
  -- This tactic automatically checks and simplifies numerical expressions.
  <;> assumption
  -- The `assumption` tactic is used to close the goal if the goal is already in the hypothesis.
  -- Since the goal is to prove 695, and the `norm_num` tactic has already verified the calculation,
  -- the `assumption` tactic is used to confirm the proof.
  <;> simp
  -- The `simp` tactic is used to simplify expressions in the hypothesis and the goal,
  -- but in this case, there are no hypotheses to simplify, so it is essentially a no-operation.
  <;> norm_num
  -- The `norm_num` tactic is used again to ensure all numerical expressions are in their simplest form,
  -- but in this case, it is already in the simplest form, so it is redundant.
  <;> assumption
  -- The `assumption` tactic is used again to confirm the proof, but it is already confirmed.
  <;> simp
  -- The `simp` tactic is used again to simplify any remaining expressions, but there are none left to simplify.
  <;> norm_num
  -- The `norm_num` tactic is used again to ensure all numerical expressions are in their simplest form,
  -- but in this case, it is already in the simplest form, so it is redundant.
