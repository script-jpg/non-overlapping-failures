Consider the absolute value cases.

Case 1 : $a - b \geq 0$

Then we have $|a - b| = a - b$ and the inequality becomes $ab + a - b \leq 1$.

Case 2 : $a - b < 0$

Then we have $|a - b| = -(a - b) = b - a$ and the inequality becomes $ab + b - a \leq 1$.

In both cases, we use non-linear arithmetic to prove the inequality.
