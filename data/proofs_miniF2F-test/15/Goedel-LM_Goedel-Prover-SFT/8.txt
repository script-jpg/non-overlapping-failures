  Given real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\), we need to show that \(ab + |a - b| \leq 1\). We will consider different cases based on the signs of \(a - b\) and \(a + b\).
  1. **Case 1: \(a - b \geq 0\) and \(a + b \geq 0\)**
     - Since \(a - b \geq 0\), we have \(|a - b| = a - b\).
     - Since \(a + b \geq 0\), we have \(|a + b| = a + b\).
     - We need to show \(ab + (a - b) \leq 1\).
  2. **Case 2: \(a - b \geq 0\) and \(a + b \leq 0\)**
     - Since \(a - b \geq 0\), we have \(|a - b| = a - b\).
     - Since \(a + b \leq 0\), we have \(|a + b| = -(a + b)\).
     - We need to show \(ab + (a - b) \leq 1\).
  3. **Case 3: \(a - b \leq 0\) and \(a + b \geq 0\)**
     - Since \(a - b \leq 0\), we have \(|a - b| = -(a - b)\).
     - Since \(a + b \geq 0\), we have \(|a + b| = a + b\).
     - We need to show \(ab + (-(a - b)) \leq 1\).
  4. **Case 4: \(a - b \leq 0\) and \(a + b \leq 0\)**
     - Since \(a - b \leq 0\), we have \(|a - b| = -(a - b)\).
     - Since \(a + b \leq 0\), we have \(|a + b| = -(a + b)\).
     - We need to show \(ab + (-(a - b)) \leq 1\).
  In each case, we use the given condition \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\) and the properties of absolute values to derive the inequality.
