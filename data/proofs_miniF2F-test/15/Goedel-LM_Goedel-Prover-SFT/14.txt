  Given real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\), we need to show that \(ab + |a - b| \leq 1\).
  1. **Case Analysis on Absolute Value**: We consider the cases where \(a - b\) is non-negative or non-positive.
     - If \(a - b \geq 0\), then \(|a - b| = a - b\).
     - If \(a - b < 0\), then \(|a - b| = -(a - b) = b - a\).
  2. **Non-negative Case**:
     - Since \(a - b \geq 0\), we have \(|a - b| = a - b\).
     - Substituting this into the inequality, we get \(ab + (a - b) \leq 1\).
     - Simplifying, we obtain \(ab + a - b \leq 1\).
  3. **Non-positive Case**:
     - Since \(a - b < 0\), we have \(|a - b| = b - a\).
     - Substituting this into the inequality, we get \(ab + (b - a) \leq 1\).
     - Simplifying, we obtain \(ab + b - a \leq 1\).
  4. **Using the Unit Circle Condition**:
     - Given \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\), we can use this to bound the expressions.
     - By applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and the properties of the unit circle, we can show that the expressions are bounded by 1.
