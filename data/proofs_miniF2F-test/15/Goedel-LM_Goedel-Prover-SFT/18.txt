    Given real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\), we need to show that \(ab + |a - b| \leq 1\). We will consider different cases based on the signs of \(a - b\) and \(a + b\).
  1. **Case 1: \(a - b \geq 0\) and \(a + b \geq 0\)**
     - Here, \(|a - b| = a - b\) and \(|a + b| = a + b\).
     - The inequality becomes \(a b + (a - b) \leq 1\).
     - Simplifying, we get \(a b + a - b \leq 1\).
  2. **Case 2: \(a - b \geq 0\) and \(a + b \leq 0\)**
     - Here, \(|a - b| = a - b\) and \(|a + b| = -(a + b)\).
     - The inequality becomes \(a b + (a - b) \leq 1\).
     - Simplifying, we get \(a b + a - b \leq 1\).
  3. **Case 3: \(a - b \leq 0\) and \(a + b \geq 0\)**
     - Here, \(|a - b| = -(a - b)\) and \(|a + b| = a + b\).
     - The inequality becomes \(a b + (-(a - b)) \leq 1\).
     - Simplifying, we get \(a b + b - a \leq 1\).
  4. **Case 4: \(a - b \leq 0\) and \(a + b \leq 0\)**
     - Here, \(|a - b| = -(a - b)\) and \(|a + b| = -(a + b)\).
     - The inequality becomes \(a b + (-(a - b)) \leq 1\).
     - Simplifying, we get \(a b + b - a \leq 1\).
  In all cases, we use the fact that \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\) and the non-negativity of squares to derive the desired inequality.
