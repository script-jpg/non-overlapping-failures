  Given real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\), we aim to show that \(ab + |a - b| \leq 1\). The proof involves considering different cases based on the signs of \(a - b\) and \(a + b\). For each case, we use the properties of absolute values and inequalities to derive the desired result.
