  Given real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\), we need to show that \(ab + |a - b| \leq 1\).
  1. **Case Analysis on Absolute Value**: We consider two cases for the absolute value \(|a - b|\):
     - Case 1: \(a - b \geq 0\)
     - Case 2: \(a - b < 0\)
  2. **Case 1: \(a - b \geq 0\)**:
     - Since \(a - b \geq 0\), we have \(|a - b| = a - b\).
     - We need to show \(a b + (a - b) \leq 1\).
     - Using the given condition \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\), we can derive the inequality by considering the squares and the given condition.
  3. **Case 2: \(a - b < 0\)**:
     - Since \(a - b < 0\), we have \(|a - b| = -(a - b) = b - a\).
     - We need to show \(a b + (b - a) \leq 1\).
     - Using the given condition \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\), we can derive the inequality by considering the squares and the given condition.
