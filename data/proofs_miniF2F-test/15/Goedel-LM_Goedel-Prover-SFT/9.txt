  Given real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\), we need to show that \(ab + |a - b| \leq 1\).
  1. **Case Analysis on the Sign of \(a - b\)**:
     - If \(a - b \geq 0\), then \(|a - b| = a - b\).
     - If \(a - b < 0\), then \(|a - b| = -(a - b) = b - a\).
  2. **Non-negativity of Squares**:
     - Since \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\), both \(a^2\) and \(b^2\) are non-negative.
  3. **Using Non-linear Arithmetic**:
     - For \(a - b \geq 0\), consider the expression \(a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\). Since \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\), we have \(1 - 2ab \geq 0\), which simplifies to \(ab \leq \frac{1}{2}\).
     - For \(a - b < 0\), consider the expression \(a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\). Since \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\), we have \(1 - 2ab \geq 0\), which simplifies to \(ab \leq \frac{1}{2}\).
  Combining these results, we conclude that \(ab + |a - b| \leq 1\).
