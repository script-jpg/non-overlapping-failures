This theorem is asking us to find the absolute difference between the area of a $3491 \times 3491$ square and the area of a $(3491-60) \times (3491+60)$ rectangle, and prove that this difference is 3600.

Let's think about how to approach this. 

The original area is $3491^2$. 
The new area is $(3491-60)(3491+60)$. 

We could expand the new area using the difference of squares formula:
$(3491-60)(3491+60) = 3491^2 - 60^2$

So the change in area is:
$3491^2 - (3491^2 - 60^2) = 60^2 = 3600$

Since we're looking for the absolute value of the difference, and the difference is positive, the absolute value won't change it. So we should have $|3600| = 3600$.

Let's complete the proof:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

We're importing the necessary libraries and opening namespaces for mathematical operations. We also set `maxHeartbeats` to 0 to ensure Lean can handle the computation, though in this case, Lean's computational engine should be able to handle it directly.

Now, let's define the theorem:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_296 : abs ((3491 - 60) * (3491 + 60) - 3491 ^ 2 : ℤ) = 3600 := by
```

We need to compute $|(3491-60)(3491+60) - 3491^2|$. 

Let's simplify this expression algebraically:
- $(3491-60)(3491+60) = 3491^2 - 60^2$ (difference of squares)
- So the expression becomes $|3491^2 - 60^2 - 3491^2| = |-60^2| = |-(60^2)| = 60^2 = 3600$

Since Lean is working with integers and computing the absolute value of an integer expression, we can let Lean compute this directly:

```tactics
norm_num
```

The `norm_num` tactic is powerful enough to compute arithmetic expressions involving concrete integers. It will:
1. Compute $(3491 - 60) = 3431$
2. Compute $(3491 + 60) = 3551$
3. Compute $3431 \times 3551$
4. Compute $3491^2$
5. Subtract the two results
6. Take the absolute value
7. Verify that the result equals 3600

So indeed, the area changes by 3600. The Lean proof is remarkably concise because Lean's computational engine can handle these arithmetic calculations directly. Lean verifies that the absolute value of the difference between the new area and the original area is indeed 3600.
