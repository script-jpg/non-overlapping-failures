-- The area of a square with side $a$ is $a^2$. We have an initial square with side $3491$, whose area is $3491^2$. When we change the sides to $3491-60$ and $3491+60$, the area changes to $(3491-60)(3491+60)$.

  -- The difference of squares formula says that $(a-b)(a+b) = a^2 - b^2$. So, $(3491-60)(3491+60) = 3491^2 - 60^2$.

  -- So, the change in area is $3491^2 - (3491^2 - 60^2) = 60^2 = 3600$.
