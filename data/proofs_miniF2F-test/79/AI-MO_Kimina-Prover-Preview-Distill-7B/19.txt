This Lean 4 proof is calculating the change in area of a square when its length is decreased by 60 and its width is increased by 60. The original area is $3491^2$, and the new area is $(3491-60)(3491+60)$. The change in area is $3491^2 - (3491-60)(3491+60)$. 

To compute this directly:
- Original area: $3491^2 = 3491 \times 3491$
- New area: $(3491-60)(3491+60) = 3431 \times 3551$
- Change: $3491^2 - 3431 \times 3551$

Instead of calculating directly, we can use the difference of squares formula: $(a-b)(a+b) = a^2 - b^2$. So:
$(3491-60)(3491+60) = 3491^2 - 60^2$

Therefore, the change is $3491^2 - (3491^2 - 60^2) = 60^2 = 3600$

The Lean proof is using `norm_num` to compute the arithmetic expression directly. The absolute value is necessary because the problem is asking for the change in area, which could be positive or negative depending on whether we're looking at the change from the original to the new or vice versa. However, since we're subtracting the new area from the original area, we get a positive value. 

In Lean, we're proving that $|(3491-60)(3491+60) - 3491^2| = 3600$. Using the difference of squares, we know that $(3491-60)(3491+60) = 3491^2 - 60^2$, so the difference is $3491^2 - (3491^2 - 60^2) = 60^2 = 3600$. 

Since $3600$ is positive, the absolute value doesn't change it, and we get $|3600| = 3600$.
