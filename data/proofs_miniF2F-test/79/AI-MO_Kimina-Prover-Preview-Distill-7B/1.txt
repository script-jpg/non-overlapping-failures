-- The change in area is $3600$.

This problem is a straightforward arithmetic calculation. We have a square with side length 3491, and we modify it to have length 3491 - 60 and width 3491 + 60. We need to find the difference in area.

The original area is 3491². The new area is (3491 - 60)(3491 + 60). The change in area is:

3491² - (3491 - 60)(3491 + 60) = 3491² - (3491² - 60²) = 60² = 3600

Let's think about why this is true algebraically:
(a - b)(a + b) = a² - b²
So (3491 - 60)(3491 + 60) = 3491² - 60²

Therefore, the area change is:
3491² - (3491² - 60²) = 60² = 3600

The Lean proof is simple because it's a direct computation:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

```

We start by importing the necessary libraries and opening namespaces. The `maxHeartbeats` setting is increased to allow more computation time for the arithmetic.

Now, let's define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_296 : abs ((3491 - 60) * (3491 + 60) - 3491 ^ 2 : ℤ) = 3600 := by
```

We have declared the theorem. The expression `(3491 - 60) * (3491 + 60) - 3491 ^ 2` represents the change in area, and we take the absolute value since we know it should be positive.

Now we need to compute this expression. Using the algebraic identity (a - b)(a + b) = a² - b², we have:
(3491 - 60)(3491 + 60) = 3491² - 60²

So the change is 3491² - (3491² - 60²) = 60² = 3600

The Lean proof is remarkably concise because Lean can compute integer arithmetic directly:

```tactics
norm_num
```

The `norm_num` tactic is powerful for arithmetic goals. It will compute the expression directly and verify that the absolute value equals 3600.

To recap the mathematical reasoning:
1. Original area: 3491²
2. New area: (3491 - 60)(3491 + 60) = 3491² - 60²
3. Change in area: 3491² - (3491² - 60²) = 60² = 3600

The Lean proof confirms that the absolute value of the area change is indeed 3600.
