The problem involves calculating the change in area of a square when its length is decreased by 60 and its width is increased by 60. Let's think about this step by step.

First, let's understand the initial setup: We have a square with side length 3491. The area of this square is 3491².

When the length is decreased by 60, the new length becomes 3491 - 60 = 3431.
When the width is increased by 60, the new width becomes 3491 + 60 = 3551.

The new area is then 3431 × 3551.

The change in area is the difference between the new area and the original area:
ΔArea = 3431 × 3551 - 3491²

Let's calculate this directly:
3431 × 3551 = (3491 - 60) × (3491 + 60) = 3491² - 60² (difference of squares formula)
So ΔArea = (3491² - 60²) - 3491² = -60² = -3600

The absolute value of the change is |ΔArea| = 3600.

In Lean, we need to prove that the absolute value of the difference between the new area and the original area is 3600. We'll work with integers (`ℤ`) to preserve the sign:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

```

Now we'll define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_296 : abs ((3491 - 60) * (3491 + 60) - 3491 ^ 2 : ℤ) = 3600 := by
```

We need to compute the absolute value of the difference between the new area and the original area. Let's simplify the expression:

(3491 - 60) * (3491 + 60) = 3491² - 60² (using the difference of squares formula)
So the difference is (3491² - 60²) - 3491² = -60² = -3600
The absolute value is |-3600| = 3600

In Lean, we can use `norm_num` to compute this directly:

```tactics
norm_num
```

The `norm_num` tactic is powerful enough to compute arithmetic expressions involving integers. It will:
1. Evaluate (3491 - 60) * (3491 + 60) as 3491² - 60²
2. Subtract 3491² to get -60²
3. Compute the absolute value of -3600 to get 3600

And it will verify that indeed, the absolute value of the difference is 3600, completing our proof.

The mathematical insight is that changing the dimensions of the square by -60 and +60 results in a change of area equal to -60², because the area change is essentially the difference of squares formula applied to the original square and the modified rectangle.
