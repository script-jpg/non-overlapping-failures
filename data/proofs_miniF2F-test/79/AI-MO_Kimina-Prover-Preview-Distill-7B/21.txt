-- The change in area is $3600$.
  norm_num
```

This solution is concise because the problem can be solved by direct computation. The area of the original square is $3491^2$, and the area of the modified rectangle is $(3491-60)(3491+60)$. The difference between these two areas is $3600$. 

To understand why this is true algebraically, consider the difference of squares formula: $(a-b)(a+b) = a^2 - b^2$. Here, $a = 3491$ and $b = 60$, so $(3491-60)(3491+60) = 3491^2 - 60^2$. Therefore, the difference in area is $3491^2 - (3491^2 - 60^2) = 60^2 = 3600$.

The Lean proof is very straightforward:
- We import the necessary libraries
- We open the necessary namespaces
- We define the theorem with the exact statement
- We use `norm_num` to compute the arithmetic expression directly

The `norm_num` tactic is powerful enough to evaluate arithmetic expressions involving integers, and it will compute the exact value of $(3491 - 60) \cdot (3491 + 60) - 3491^2$, verify it is $-3600$, and then take the absolute value to get $3600$.

Therefore, the area of the square changes by $3600$ when its length is decreased by $60$ and its width is increased by $60$.
