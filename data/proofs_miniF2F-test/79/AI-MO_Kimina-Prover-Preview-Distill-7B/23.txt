The problem asks us to find the change in area of a square when its length is decreased by 60 and its width is increased by 60. The original square has side length 3491.

Let's calculate the original area and the new area:

1. **Original Area**: The original square has side length 3491, so its area is \(3491^2\).

2. **New Dimensions**:
   - New length: \(3491 - 60 = 3431\)
   - New width: \(3491 + 60 = 3551\)

3. **New Area**: The area of the new rectangle is \(3431 \times 3551\).

4. **Area Change**: The change in area is \(3431 \times 3551 - 3491^2\).

Let's compute this change:

We can use the difference of squares formula to simplify the calculation:
\(3431 \times 3551 = (3491 - 60)(3491 + 60) = 3491^2 - 60^2\)

So the area change is:
\(3491^2 - 60^2 - 3491^2 = -60^2 = -3600\)

The absolute value of the area change is \(3600\).

The Lean proof:
```tactics

import Aesop

We start by importing the necessary libraries and setting up the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_296 : abs ((3491 - 60) * (3491 + 60) - 3491 ^ 2 : ℤ) = 3600 := by
```

Now we need to compute the value of \((3491 - 60) \times (3491 + 60) - 3491^2\).

Using the difference of squares formula:
\((3491 - 60)(3491 + 60) = 3491^2 - 60^2\)

So the expression becomes:
\(3491^2 - 60^2 - 3491^2 = -60^2 = -3600\)

The absolute value of \(-3600\) is \(3600\).

In Lean, we can compute this directly using `norm_num`:

```tactics
norm_num
```

The `norm_num` tactic is powerful for arithmetic goals. It will compute the exact value of the expression \((3491 - 60) \times (3491 + 60) - 3491^2\), confirm it is \(-3600\), and then take the absolute value to get \(3600\), completing the proof.

Therefore, the area of the square changes by \(\boxed{3600}\).
