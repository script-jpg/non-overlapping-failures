The Lean proof is very concise because the problem is purely computational. The area of the original square is $3491^2$, and when we decrease the length by $60$ and increase the width by $60$, the new area becomes $(3491-60)(3491+60)$. 

To find the change in area, we compute the difference between the original area and the new area:
$3491^2 - (3491-60)(3491+60)$

This simplifies using the difference of squares formula: $(a-b)(a+b) = a^2 - b^2$
$3491^2 - (3491^2 - 60^2)$
$3491^2 - 3491^2 + 60^2$
$60^2 = 3600$

So the area increases by $3600$. The Lean proof calculates this directly by evaluating the arithmetic expression. The `norm_num` tactic is powerful enough to compute this arithmetic goal directly. The cast to `ℤ` is necessary because subtraction of integers is not the same as subtraction of natural numbers in Lean (which would be rounded down).

The Lean proof is complete and demonstrates that the absolute value of the area change is indeed $3600$.
