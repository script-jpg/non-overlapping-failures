The problem asks us to find the change in area of a square when its length is decreased by 60 and its width is increased by 60. The original square has side length 3491. 

To solve this, we need to calculate the area of the original square and the area of the modified rectangle, then find the absolute difference between these two areas.

1. **Original Area**: The original area of the square is $3491 \times 3491 = 3491^2$.

2. **Modified Area**: After changing the dimensions, the new length is $3491 - 60 = 3431$ and the new width is $3491 + 60 = 3551$. So the new area is $3431 \times 3551$.

3. **Area Change**: The change in area is $3431 \times 3551 - 3491^2$.

We can compute this directly:
- $3431 \times 3551 = (3491 - 60) \times (3491 + 60) = 3491^2 - 60^2$ (difference of squares)
- So the area change is $3491^2 - 60^2 - 3491^2 = -60^2 = -3600$
- Taking absolute value, we get $3600$

In Lean, we can compute this as follows:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

We begin by importing the necessary libraries and setting up the basic environment.

Now, let's define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_296 : abs ((3491 - 60) * (3491 + 60) - 3491 ^ 2 : ℤ) = 3600 := by
```

We're setting up the theorem to prove that the absolute value of the area change is 3600. The expression `(3491 - 60) * (3491 + 60) - 3491 ^ 2` computes the difference between the new area and the original area.

Now, let's compute this algebraically to verify:
- $(3491 - 60) \times (3491 + 60) = 3491^2 - 60^2$ (difference of squares)
- So the difference is $3491^2 - 60^2 - 3491^2 = -60^2 = -3600$
- Absolute value is $3600$

In Lean, we can compute this directly:

```tactics
norm_num
```

The `norm_num` tactic is powerful enough to compute arithmetic expressions like this directly. It will evaluate the integer expression and compute its absolute value.

So our complete proof is:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat


theorem mathd_algebra_296 : abs ((3491 - 60) * (3491 + 60) - 3491 ^ 2 : ℤ) = 3600 := by 
  norm_num
```

This proof is complete. The `norm_num` tactic has computed that the expression evaluates to 3600, confirming our manual calculation.

Therefore, the area of the square changes by 3600 when the length is decreased by 60 and the width is increased by 60.
