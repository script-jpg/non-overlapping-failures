The key insight is to use the difference of squares formula, which states that $(x - y)(x + y) = x^2 - y^2$. In this problem, we have a square with side length $c = 3491$, and we modify it to have side length $a = c - 60$ (decreased by 60) and $b = c + 60$ (increased by 60).

The original area is $c^2$, and the new area is $a \cdot b$. The change in area is $c^2 - a \cdot b$.

Substituting $a = c - 60$ and $b = c + 60$ into the expression for the new area:
$a \cdot b = (c - 60)(c + 60) = c^2 - 60^2$ (using the difference of squares formula)

So the change in area is:
$c^2 - (c^2 - 60^2) = 60^2 = 3600$

The Lean proof formalizes this calculation by:
1. Defining variables a, b, and c to represent the modified length, modified width, and original side of the square, respectively.
2. Using the difference of squares formula to simplify the expression $(c - 60)(c + 60)$ to $c^2 - 60^2$
3. Calculating that the change in area is $c^2 - (c^2 - 60^2) = 60^2 = 3600$

Therefore, the area of the square changes by 3600 when its length is decreased by 60 and width is increased by 60.
</-- A $3491$ by $3491$ square has its length decreased by $60$ and its width increased by $60$.  By how much does its area change? Show that it is 3600.-/
