  To solve the problem of determining the change in the area of a \(3491 \times 3491\) square when its length is decreased by 60 and its width is increased by 60, we need to follow these steps:
  1. Calculate the new length and width after the changes:
     - Original length: 3491
     - Original width: 3491
     - New length: \(3491 - 60 = 3431\)
     - New width: \(3491 + 60 = 3551\)
  2. Compute the original and new areas of the square:
     - Original area: \(3491 \times 3491\)
     - New area: \(3431 \times 3551\)
  3. Calculate the difference in area:
     - Difference: \(3431 \times 3551 - 3491 \times 3491\)
  4. Simplify the expression to find the absolute value of the difference:
     - \(3431 \times 3551 - 3491 \times 3491 = 3600\)
  Thus, the area of the square changes by \(3600\).
