  To solve the problem, we need to determine the change in area of a \(3491 \times 3491\) square when its length is decreased by 60 and its width is increased by 60. We are given that the area change is 3600.
  First, we calculate the new dimensions of the square:
  - The new length is \(3491 - 60 = 3431\).
  - The new width is \(3491 + 60 = 3551\).
  Next, we find the new area of the square:
  \[ \text{New Area} = 3431 \times 3551 \]
  We then compute the original area of the square:
  \[ \text{Original Area} = 3491 \times 3491 \]
  The change in area is the difference between the new area and the original area:
  \[ \text{Change in Area} = 3431 \times 3551 - 3491 \times 3491 \]
  We need to show that this change in area equals 3600.
