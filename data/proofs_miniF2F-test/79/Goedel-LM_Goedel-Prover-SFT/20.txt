  To determine the change in the area of a \(3491 \times 3491\) square when its length is decreased by 60 and its width is increased by 60, we need to calculate the new area and compare it to the original area.
  1. **Calculate the new dimensions**:
     - New length: \(3491 - 60 = 3431\)
     - New width: \(3491 + 60 = 3551\)
  2. **Calculate the new area**:
     - New area: \(3431 \times 3551\)
  3. **Calculate the original area**:
     - Original area: \(3491 \times 3491\)
  4. **Find the difference in area**:
     - Change in area: \(3431 \times 3551 - 3491 \times 3491\)
  5. **Simplify the expression**:
     - The expression simplifies to \(3600\), as shown by the calculation in the Lean4 code.
