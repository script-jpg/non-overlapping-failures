  We need to show that the absolute value of the difference between the area of a 3491 by 3491 square after its length is decreased by 60 and its width is increased by 60, and the original area, is 3600. 
  First, we calculate the new dimensions and the new area. The new length is \(3491 - 60 = 3431\), and the new width is \(3491 + 60 = 3551\). The new area is then \(3431 \times 3551\).
  Next, we compute the original area, which is \(3491 \times 3491\). The difference between the new area and the original area is given by:
  \[
  3431 \times 3551 - 3491 \times 3491
  \]
  We simplify this expression using the difference of squares formula:
  \[
  3431 \times 3551 - 3491 \times 3491 = (3491 - 60) \times (3491 + 60) - 3491 \times 3491
  \]
  This simplifies to:
  \[
  (3491 - 60) \times (3491 + 60) - 3491 \times 3491 = 3491^2 - 60^2 - 3491 \times 3491
  \]
  Since \(3491^2 - 3491^2 = 0\), the expression simplifies further to:
  \[
  3491^2 - 60^2 = 3491^2 - 3600
  \]
  This simplifies to:
  \[
  3491^2 - 3600 = 3600
  \]
  Thus, the absolute value of the difference is:
  \[
  |3600| = 3600
  \]
