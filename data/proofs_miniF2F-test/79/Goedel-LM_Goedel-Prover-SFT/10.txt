  To determine the change in the area of a \(3491 \times 3491\) square when its length is decreased by 60 and its width is increased by 60, we start by calculating the original area and the new area. The original area of the square is \(3491^2\). The new dimensions are \(3491 - 60\) and \(3491 + 60\). The new area is \((3491 - 60)(3491 + 60)\).
  First, we simplify the expression \((3491 - 60)(3491 + 60)\):
  \[
  (3491 - 60)(3491 + 60) = 3491^2 - 60^2
  \]
  Next, we compute the difference between the new area and the original area:
  \[
  3491^2 - 60^2 - 3491^2 = -60^2
  \]
  Since \(60^2 = 3600\), we have:
  \[
  -60^2 = -3600
  \]
  Thus, the change in the area is \(-3600\).
