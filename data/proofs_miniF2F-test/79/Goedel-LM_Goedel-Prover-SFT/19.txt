  To determine the change in the area of a square with side length 3491, we decrease the length by 60 and increase the width by 60. The original area of the square is \(3491^2\). The new dimensions are \(3491 - 60\) and \(3491 + 60\). The new area is calculated as \((3491 - 60)(3491 + 60)\). We need to find the absolute difference between the new area and the original area, which is given to be 3600.
