  Given a 3491 by 3491 square, we decrease its length by 60 and increase its width by 60. We need to determine the change in the area of the square. The original area of the square is \(3491^2\). The new dimensions are \(3491 - 60\) and \(3491 + 60\). The new area is \((3491 - 60) \times (3491 + 60)\). We calculate the difference between the new area and the original area to find the change in the area.
  First, we compute the new area:
  \[
  (3491 - 60) \times (3491 + 60) = 3431 \times 3551
  \]
  Next, we compute the original area:
  \[
  3491^2
  \]
  The change in the area is:
  \[
  3431 \times 3551 - 3491^2
  \]
  We simplify the expression:
  \[
  3431 \times 3551 - 3491^2 = 3491 \times (3551 - 3491) = 3491 \times 60 = 209460
  \]
  The absolute value of this change is:
  \[
  \left| 209460 \right| = 209460
  \]
  However, the problem states that the change in the area is 3600. This discrepancy suggests a possible error in the calculation or interpretation of the problem.
