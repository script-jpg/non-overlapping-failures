  To determine the change in the area of a \(3491 \times 3491\) square when its length is decreased by 60 and its width increased by 60, we start by calculating the new dimensions and then the new area. The original area is then subtracted from the new area to find the change.
  1. The new length is \(3491 - 60 = 3431\).
  2. The new width is \(3491 + 60 = 3551\).
  3. The new area is \(3431 \times 3551\).
  4. The original area is \(3491 \times 3491\).
  5. The change in area is \(3431 \times 3551 - 3491 \times 3491\).
  6. We simplify this expression to find that the change in area is 3600.

  -- We need to show that the absolute value of the difference between the new area and the original area is 3600.
  apply Eq.symm
  -- Simplify the expression using basic arithmetic operations.
  norm_num [abs_of_nonneg]
  -- The result of the simplification shows that the absolute value is indeed 3600.
