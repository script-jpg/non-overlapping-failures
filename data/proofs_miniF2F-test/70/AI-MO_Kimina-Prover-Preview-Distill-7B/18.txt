-- We will solve this using the Fermat's Little Theorem and modular arithmetic.
  -- First, let's reduce the bases modulo 11.
  have h1 : 129 % 11 = 7 := by norm_num
  have h2 : 96 % 11 = 9 := by norm_num

  -- By Fermat's Little Theorem, since 11 is prime, we have $a^{10} \equiv 1 \pmod{11}$ for any not divisible by 11.
  -- So let's reduce the exponents modulo 10.
  have h3 : 34 % 10 = 4 := by norm_num
  have h4 : 38 % 10 = 8 := by norm_num

  -- Now, we can rewrite the powers using these congruences.
  have h5 : 129 ^ 34 % 11 = (129 % 11) ^ 34 % 11 := by
    rw [Nat.pow_mod]
  have h6 : 96 ^ 38 % 11 = (96 % 11) ^ 38 % 11 := by
    rw [Nat.pow_mod]

  -- Substituting the reduced values:
  rw [h5, h6, h1, h2]
  -- Now we need to compute $7^4 + 9^8 \pmod{11}$

  -- Let's compute $7^4 \pmod{11}$:
  have h7 : 7 ^ 4 % 11 = 1 := by norm_num

  -- And $9^8 \pmod{11}$:
  have h8 : 9 ^ 8 % 11 = 1 := by norm_num

  -- So $7^4 + 9^8 \pmod{11}$:
  norm_num
  -- And the result is 9.
