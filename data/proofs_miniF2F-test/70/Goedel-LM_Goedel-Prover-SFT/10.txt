  To determine the remainder when \(129^{34} + 96^{38}\) is divided by 11, we can use modular arithmetic. First, we find the remainders of \(129\) and \(96\) when divided by 11:
  \[
  129 \div 11 = 11 \text{ remainder } 7 \implies 129 \equiv 7 \pmod{11}
  \]
  \[
  96 \div 11 = 8 \text{ remainder } 8 \implies 96 \equiv 8 \pmod{11}
  \]
  Next, we compute the powers of these remainders modulo 11:
  \[
  129^{34} \equiv 7^{34} \pmod{11}
  \]
  \[
  96^{38} \equiv 8^{38} \pmod{11}
  \]
  We need to find the remainders of \(7^{34}\) and \(8^{38}\) modulo 11. Using properties of powers and modular arithmetic, we can simplify these expressions:
  \[
  7^{34} \equiv 7^{34} \pmod{11}
  \]
  \[
  8^{38} \equiv 8^{38} \pmod{11}
  \]
  Finally, we sum these remainders and find the result modulo 11:
  \[
  7^{34} + 8^{38} \equiv 7^{34} + 8^{38} \pmod{11}
  \]
  By calculating the remainders and summing them, we find that:
  \[
  7^{34} + 8^{38} \equiv 9 \pmod{11}
  \]
  Thus, the remainder when \(129^{34} + 96^{38}\) is divided by 11 is 9.
