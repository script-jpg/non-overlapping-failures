  To determine the remainder when \(129^{34} + 96^{38}\) is divided by 11, we can use modular arithmetic to simplify the problem. We will compute the remainders of \(129^{34}\) and \(96^{38}\) modulo 11 and then add these remainders.
  1. Compute \(129 \mod 11\):
     \[
     129 \div 11 = 11 \text{ remainder } 8 \implies 129 \equiv 8 \mod 11
     \]
  2. Compute \(96 \mod 11\):
     \[
     96 \div 11 = 8 \text{ remainder } 8 \implies 96 \equiv 8 \mod 11
     \]
  3. Compute \(8^{34} \mod 11\):
     \[
     8^2 = 64 \equiv 9 \mod 11
     \]
     \[
     8^4 = (8^2)^2 = 9^2 = 81 \equiv 4 \mod 11
     \]
     \[
     8^8 = (8^4)^2 = 4^2 = 16 \equiv 5 \mod 11
     \]
     \[
     8^{16} = (8^8)^2 = 5^2 = 25 \equiv 1 \mod 11
     \]
     Since \(8^{16} \equiv 1 \mod 11\), \(8^{34} = 8^{34 \mod 16} \equiv 8^6 \equiv 1 \mod 11\).
  4. Compute \(8^{38} \mod 11\):
     \[
     8^{38} = 8^{34 + 4} \equiv 8^4 \equiv 4 \mod 11
     \]
  5. Add the remainders:
     \[
     129^{34} + 96^{38} \equiv 8 + 4 \equiv 12 \equiv 1 \mod 11
     \]
  Thus, the remainder when \(129^{34} + 96^{38}\) is divided by 11 is 9.
