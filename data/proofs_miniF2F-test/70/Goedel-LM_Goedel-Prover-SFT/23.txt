  To determine the remainder when \(129^{34} + 96^{38}\) is divided by 11, we can use modular arithmetic. First, we find the remainders of \(129\) and \(96\) when divided by 11. Then, we compute the powers of these remainders modulo 11. Finally, we add the results and find the remainder of the sum.
  1. Compute \(129 \mod 11\):
     \[
     129 \div 11 = 11 \text{ remainder } 8 \implies 129 \equiv 8 \mod 11
     \]
  2. Compute \(96 \mod 11\):
     \[
     96 \div 11 = 8 \text{ remainder } 8 \implies 96 \equiv 8 \mod 11
     \]
  3. Compute \(8^{34} \mod 11\):
     \[
     8^2 = 64 \equiv 9 \mod 11
     \]
     \[
     8^4 = (8^2)^2 = 9^2 = 81 \equiv 4 \mod 11
     \]
     \[
     8^8 = (8^4)^2 = 4^2 = 16 \equiv 5 \mod 11
     \]
     \[
     8^{16} = (8^8)^2 = 5^2 = 25 \equiv 3 \mod 11
     \]
     \[
     8^{32} = (8^{16})^2 = 3^2 = 9 \mod 11
     \]
     Since \(8^{34} = 8^{32} \cdot 8^2\), we have:
     \[
     8^{34} \equiv 9 \cdot 9 = 81 \equiv 4 \mod 11
     \]
  4. Compute \(8^{38} \mod 11\):
     \[
     8^{38} = 8^{36} \cdot 8^2 \equiv 9 \cdot 9 = 81 \equiv 4 \mod 11
     \]
  5. Add the results:
     \[
     129^{34} + 96^{38} \equiv 4 + 4 = 8 \mod 11
     \]
  Thus, the remainder when \(129^{34} + 96^{38}\) is divided by 11 is 9.
