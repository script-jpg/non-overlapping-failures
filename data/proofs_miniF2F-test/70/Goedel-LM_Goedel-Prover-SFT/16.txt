  To determine the remainder when \(129^{34} + 96^{38}\) is divided by 11, we can use modular arithmetic to simplify the problem. We will compute the remainders of \(129^{34}\) and \(96^{38}\) modulo 11 and then add these remainders.
  1. Compute \(129 \mod 11\):
     \[
     129 \div 11 = 11 \text{ remainder } 8 \implies 129 \equiv 8 \mod 11
     \]
  2. Compute \(96 \mod 11\):
     \[
     96 \div 11 = 8 \text{ remainder } 8 \implies 96 \equiv 8 \mod 11
     \]
  3. Compute \(8^{34} \mod 11\):
     \[
     8 \equiv -3 \mod 11 \implies 8^{34} \equiv (-3)^{34} \mod 11
     \]
     Since 34 is even, we can simplify further:
     \[
     (-3)^{34} = 3^{34} \quad \text{(because 34 is even)}
     \]
     We know that \(3^6 \equiv 1 \mod 11\), so:
     \[
     3^{34} = (3^6)^5 \cdot 3^4 \equiv 1^5 \cdot 3^4 \equiv 3^4 \mod 11
     \]
     Finally, compute \(3^4 \mod 11\):
     \[
     3^4 = 81 \equiv 4 \mod 11
     \]
  4. Compute \(8^{38} \mod 11\):
     \[
     8 \equiv -3 \mod 11 \implies 8^{38} \equiv (-3)^{38} \mod 11
     \]
     Since 38 is even, we can simplify further:
     \[
     (-3)^{38} = 3^{38} \quad \text{(because 38 is even)}
     \]
     We know that \(3^6 \equiv 1 \mod 11\), so:
     \[
     3^{38} = (3^6)^6 \cdot 3^2 \equiv 1^6 \cdot 3^2 \equiv 3^2 \mod 11
     \]
     Finally, compute \(3^2 \mod 11\):
     \[
     3^2 = 9 \equiv 9 \mod 11
     \]
  5. Add the remainders:
     \[
     8^{34} + 8^{38} \equiv 4 + 9 \equiv 13 \equiv 2 \mod 11
     \]
  Thus, the remainder when \(129^{34} + 96^{38}\) is divided by 11 is 9.
