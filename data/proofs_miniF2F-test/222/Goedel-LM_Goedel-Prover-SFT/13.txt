  We need to show that the smallest of the even integers is 8. Given that the sum of 5 consecutive even integers is 4 less than the sum of the first 8 consecutive odd counting numbers, we can set up the equation:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{7} (2k + 1) - \sum_{k=0}^{4} (a + 2k) = 4
  \]
  First, we compute the sum of the first 8 odd counting numbers:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{7} (2k + 1) = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 = 64
  \]
  Next, we express the sum of the first 5 even integers starting from \(a\):
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{4} (a + 2k) = a + (a + 2) + (a + 4) + (a + 6) + (a + 8) = 5a + 20
  \]
  Substituting these into the given equation, we get:
  \[
  64 - (5a + 20) = 4
  \]
  Simplifying this equation:
  \[
  64 - 5a - 20 = 4 \implies 44 - 5a = 4 \implies 40 = 5a \implies a = 8
  \]
  Thus, the smallest of the even integers is \(a = 8\).
