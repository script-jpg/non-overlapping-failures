  We need to show that the smallest of the even integers \(a\) is 8, given the condition that the sum of 5 consecutive even integers is 4 less than the sum of the first 8 consecutive odd counting numbers.
  1. **Sum of the first 8 consecutive odd counting numbers**: The sum of the first 8 odd numbers is given by the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:
     \[
     \sum_{k=0}^{7} (2k + 1) = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 = 64
     \]
  2. **Sum of 5 consecutive even integers**: The sum of \(a, a+2, a+4, a+6, a+8\) is:
     \[
     a + (a+2) + (a+4) + (a+6) + (a+8) = 5a + 20
     \]
  3. **Given condition**: The difference between the sum of the first 8 odd numbers and the sum of 5 consecutive even integers is 4:
     \[
     64 - (5a + 20) = 4
     \]
  4. **Solving for \(a\)**:
     \[
     64 - 5a - 20 = 4 \implies 44 - 5a = 4 \implies 5a = 40 \implies a = 8
     \]
  Thus, the smallest of the even integers is \(a = 8\).
