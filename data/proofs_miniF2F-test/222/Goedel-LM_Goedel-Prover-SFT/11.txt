  We need to show that the smallest of the even integers \(a\) is 8, given that the sum of 5 consecutive even integers is 4 less than the sum of the first 8 consecutive odd counting numbers.
  1. **Sum of the first 8 odd counting numbers**: The sum of the first 8 odd counting numbers is given by the sum of the sequence \(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15\). This can be calculated as:
     \[
     \sum_{k=0}^{7} (2k + 1) = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 = 64
     \]
  2. **Sum of the first 5 even integers**: The sum of the first 5 even integers is given by the sum of the sequence \(a, a+2, a+4, a+6, a+8\). This can be calculated as:
     \[
     \sum_{k=0}^{4} (a + 2k) = a + (a + 2) + (a + 4) + (a + 6) + (a + 8) = 5a + 20
     \]
  3. **Given condition**: The sum of the first 5 even integers is 4 less than the sum of the first 8 odd counting numbers:
     \[
     5a + 20 = 64 - 4
     \]
  4. **Solving for \(a\)**:
     \[
     5a + 20 = 60 \implies 5a = 40 \implies a = 8
     \]
  Thus, the smallest of the even integers is \(a = 8\).
