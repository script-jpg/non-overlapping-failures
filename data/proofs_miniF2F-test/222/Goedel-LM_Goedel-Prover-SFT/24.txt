  To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest even integer \( a \) such that the sum of 5 consecutive even integers starting from \( a \) is 4 less than the sum of the first 8 consecutive odd counting numbers. We will show that \( a = 8 \).
  First, we express the sums involved:
  - The sum of the first 8 consecutive odd counting numbers is:
    \[
    \sum_{k=0}^{7} (2k + 1) = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 = 64
    \]
  - The sum of 5 consecutive even integers starting from \( a \) is:
    \[
    \sum_{k=0}^{4} (a + 2k) = a + (a + 2) + (a + 4) + (a + 6) + (a + 8) = 5a + 20
    \]
  According to the problem, the difference between these two sums is 4:
  \[
  64 - (5a + 20) = 4
  \]
  Solving for \( a \):
  \[
  64 - 5a - 20 = 4 \implies 44 - 5a = 4 \implies 40 = 5a \implies a = 8
  \]
  Thus, the smallest even integer \( a \) is indeed 8.
