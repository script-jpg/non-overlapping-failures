  We need to show that the sum of 5 consecutive even integers is 4 less than the sum of the first 8 consecutive odd counting numbers, and that the smallest of the even integers is 8.
  1. **Sum of 5 consecutive even integers**: Let the smallest even integer be \( a \). The sum of the first 5 even integers is:
     \[
     a + (a + 2) + (a + 4) + (a + 6) + (a + 8) = 5a + 20
     \]
  2. **Sum of the first 8 consecutive odd counting numbers**: The sum of the first 8 odd counting numbers is:
     \[
     1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 = 64
     \]
  3. **Given condition**: The sum of the first 5 even integers is 4 less than the sum of the first 8 odd counting numbers:
     \[
     5a + 20 = 64 - 4
     \]
  4. **Solving for \( a \)**:
     \[
     5a + 20 = 60 \implies 5a = 40 \implies a = 8
     \]
  Thus, the smallest even integer is \( a = 8 \).
