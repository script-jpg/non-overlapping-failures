  Given the problem, we need to show that the smallest of the 5 consecutive even integers is 8. The sum of the first 8 consecutive odd counting numbers is 4 less than the sum of the 5 consecutive even integers. We will verify that the smallest even integer is indeed 8.

  /- Simplify the sum expressions to verify the given condition.
     The sum of the first 8 consecutive odd numbers is calculated as:
     \[
     \sum_{k=0}^{7} (2k + 1) = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 = 64
     \]
     The sum of the first 5 consecutive even numbers is:
     \[
     \sum_{k=0}^{4} (a + 2k) = a + (a + 2) + (a + 4) + (a + 6) + (a + 8) = 5a + 20
     \]
     Given that the sum of the odd numbers is 4 less than the sum of the even numbers:
     \[
     64 = (5a + 20) + 4
     \]
     Solving for \( a \):
     \[
     64 = 5a + 24 \implies 40 = 5a \implies a = 8
     \]
