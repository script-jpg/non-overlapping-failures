  We need to show that the smallest of the even integers \(a\) is 8, given that the sum of 5 consecutive even integers is 4 less than the sum of the first 8 consecutive odd counting numbers.
  1. **Sum of 5 consecutive even integers**: Let \(a\) be the smallest of the 5 consecutive even integers. The sum of these integers is \(a + (a + 2) + (a + 4) + (a + 6) + (a + 8)\).
  2. **Sum of the first 8 consecutive odd counting numbers**: The sum of the first 8 consecutive odd counting numbers is \(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15\).
  3. **Difference given**: We are given that the sum of the 5 consecutive even integers is 4 less than the sum of the first 8 consecutive odd counting numbers.
  4. **Setting up the equation**: We set up the equation based on the given difference:
     \[
     (a + (a + 2) + (a + 4) + (a + 6) + (a + 8)) = ((1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15) - 4)
     \]
  5. **Simplifying the equation**: Simplify the left-hand side:
     \[
     a + (a + 2) + (a + 4) + (a + 6) + (a + 8) = 5a + 20
     \]
     Simplify the right-hand side:
     \[
     1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 = 64
     \]
     Thus, the equation becomes:
     \[
     5a + 20 = 64 - 4 = 60
     \]
  6. **Solving for \(a\)**: We solve for \(a\):
     \[
     5a + 20 = 60 \implies 5a = 40 \implies a = 8
     \]
  Therefore, the smallest of the even integers is \(a = 8\).
