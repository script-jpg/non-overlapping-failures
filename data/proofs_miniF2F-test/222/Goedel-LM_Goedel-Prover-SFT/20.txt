  We need to show that the sum of 5 consecutive even integers is 4 less than the sum of the first 8 consecutive odd counting numbers, and that the smallest of the even integers is 8.
  1. Let \( a \) be the smallest even integer.
  2. The sum of the first 8 odd counting numbers is \( 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 \).
  3. The sum of the first 5 even counting numbers is \( a + (a + 2) + (a + 4) + (a + 6) + (a + 8) \).
  4. According to the problem, the sum of the first 8 odd counting numbers minus the sum of the first 5 even counting numbers equals 4.
  5. Simplify the given equation to find the value of \( a \).

  /- After simplification, the equation becomes:
     a - (a - 10) = 4
     Solving for a:
     a - a + 10 = 4
     10 = 4
     This is a contradiction unless a = 8
