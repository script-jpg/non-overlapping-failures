  We need to show that the sum of 5 consecutive even integers is 4 less than the sum of the first 8 consecutive odd counting numbers, and that the smallest of the even integers is 8.
  1. **Sum of the first 8 consecutive odd counting numbers**:
     The sum of the first 8 odd numbers can be calculated as:
     \[
     \sum_{k=0}^{7} (2k + 1) = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 = 64
     \]
  2. **Sum of 5 consecutive even integers**:
     Let the smallest even integer be \( a \). The 5 consecutive even integers are:
     \[
     a, a+2, a+4, a+6, a+8
     \]
     The sum of these integers is:
     \[
     a + (a + 2) + (a + 4) + (a + 6) + (a + 8) = 5a + 20
     \]
  3. **Difference between the sums**:
     According to the problem, the sum of the 5 consecutive even integers is 4 less than the sum of the first 8 consecutive odd integers:
     \[
     5a + 20 = 64 - 4 = 60
     \]
  4. **Solving for \( a \)**:
     \[
     5a + 20 = 60 \implies 5a = 40 \implies a = 8
     \]
  Thus, the smallest of the even integers is 8.
