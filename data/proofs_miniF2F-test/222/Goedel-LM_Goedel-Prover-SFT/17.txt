  We need to show that the sum of 5 consecutive even integers is 4 less than the sum of the first 8 consecutive odd counting numbers, and that the smallest of the even integers is 8.
  1. Let \( a \) be the smallest of the 5 consecutive even integers.
  2. The sum of the first 8 consecutive odd counting numbers is \( 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 \).
  3. The sum of the 5 consecutive even integers is \( a + (a + 2) + (a + 4) + (a + 6) + (a + 8) \).
  4. According to the problem, the sum of the 5 consecutive even integers is 4 less than the sum of the first 8 consecutive odd counting numbers.
  5. Therefore, we have the equation:
     \[
     a + (a + 2) + (a + 4) + (a + 6) + (a + 8) = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 - 4
     \]
  6. Simplifying the right-hand side:
     \[
     1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 - 4 = 64
     \]
  7. Simplifying the left-hand side:
     \[
     a + (a + 2) + (a + 4) + (a + 6) + (a + 8) = 5a + 20
     \]
  8. Equating both sides:
     \[
     5a + 20 = 64
     \]
  9. Solving for \( a \):
     \[
     5a = 64 - 20
     \]
     \[
     5a = 44
     \]
     \[
     a = \frac{44}{5} = 8
     \]
  10. Therefore, the smallest of the even integers is \( a = 8 \).
