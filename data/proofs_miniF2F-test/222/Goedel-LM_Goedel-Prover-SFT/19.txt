  We need to show that the smallest of the even integers that satisfy the given conditions is 8. The conditions are:
  1. The sum of 5 consecutive even integers is 4 less than the sum of the first 8 consecutive odd counting numbers.
  2. The smallest of the even integers is 8.
  First, we express the sum of the first 8 consecutive odd counting numbers and the sum of the first 5 consecutive even integers. The sum of the first 8 odd numbers is given by the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:
  \[ \sum_{k=0}^{7} (2k + 1) \]
  The sum of the first 5 even numbers is:
  \[ \sum_{k=0}^{4} (a + 2k) \]
  According to the problem, the sum of the first 5 even numbers is 4 less than the sum of the first 8 odd numbers:
  \[ \sum_{k=0}^{4} (a + 2k) = \sum_{k=0}^{7} (2k + 1) - 4 \]
  We simplify the sums:
  \[ \sum_{k=0}^{4} (a + 2k) = 5a + 2 \sum_{k=0}^{4} k = 5a + 2 \times 10 = 5a + 20 \]
  \[ \sum_{k=0}^{7} (2k + 1) = 2 \sum_{k=0}^{7} k + \sum_{k=0}^{7} 1 = 2 \times 28 + 8 = 56 + 8 = 64 \]
  Thus, we have:
  \[ 5a + 20 = 64 - 4 \]
  \[ 5a + 20 = 60 \]
  \[ 5a = 40 \]
  \[ a = 8 \]
  Therefore, the smallest of the even integers is 8.
