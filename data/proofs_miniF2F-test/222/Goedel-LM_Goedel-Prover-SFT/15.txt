  We need to show that the sum of 5 consecutive even integers is 4 less than the sum of the first 8 consecutive odd counting numbers, and that the smallest of the even integers is 8.
  1. **Sum of the first 8 consecutive odd counting numbers**:
     - The sum of the first \( n \) odd numbers is given by \( n^2 \).
     - Therefore, the sum of the first 8 odd numbers is \( 8^2 = 64 \).
  2. **Sum of the first 5 consecutive even integers**:
     - Let the smallest even integer be \( a \).
     - The sum of the first 5 even integers can be expressed as:
       \[
       a + (a + 2) + (a + 4) + (a + 6) + (a + 8)
       \]
     - Simplifying this, we get:
       \[
       5a + 20
       \]
  3. **Difference between the sums**:
     - According to the problem, the sum of the first 5 even integers is 4 less than the sum of the first 8 odd integers:
       \[
       64 - (5a + 20) = 4
       \]
  4. **Solving for \( a \)**:
     - Simplify the equation:
       \[
       64 - 5a - 20 = 4
       \]
       \[
       44 - 5a = 4
       \]
       \[
       40 = 5a
       \]
       \[
       a = 8
       \]
  Thus, the smallest even integer is \( a = 8 \).
