  We need to show that the smallest of the even integers is 8. Given the problem, we start by expressing the sum of the first 8 consecutive odd counting numbers and the sum of 5 consecutive even integers. The sum of the first 8 odd numbers is calculated as \( \sum_{k=0}^{7} (2k + 1) \), and the sum of the first 5 even numbers starting from \( a \) is \( \sum_{k=0}^{4} (a + 2k) \).
  The relationship given is:
  \[ \sum_{k=0}^{7} (2k + 1) - \sum_{k=0}^{4} (a + 2k) = 4 \]
  First, we simplify the sums:
  \[ \sum_{k=0}^{7} (2k + 1) = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 = 64 \]
  \[ \sum_{k=0}^{4} (a + 2k) = a + (a + 2) + (a + 4) + (a + 6) + (a + 8) = 5a + 20 \]
  Substituting these into the given equation:
  \[ 64 - (5a + 20) = 4 \]
  Solving for \( a \):
  \[ 64 - 5a - 20 = 4 \]
  \[ 44 - 5a = 4 \]
  \[ 40 = 5a \]
  \[ a = 8 \]
  Thus, the smallest of the even integers is 8.
