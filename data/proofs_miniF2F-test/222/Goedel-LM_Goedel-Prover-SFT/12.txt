  We need to show that the smallest of the even integers \(a\) that satisfies the given conditions is 8. The conditions are:
  1. The sum of 5 consecutive even integers is 4 less than the sum of the first 8 consecutive odd counting numbers.
  2. The integers are even, specifically \(a\) is even.
  First, we express the sum of the first 8 consecutive odd counting numbers as \(2 \times (1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + 8)\). The sum of the first 5 consecutive even integers is \(a + (a + 2) + (a + 4) + (a + 6) + (a + 8)\).
  We set up the equation:
  \[ \sum_{k=1}^{8} (2k - 1) - \sum_{k=1}^{5} (a + 2k) = 4 \]
  Simplifying the sums:
  \[ 2 \times (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8) - (a + (a + 2) + (a + 4) + (a + 6) + (a + 8)) = 4 \]
  \[ 2 \times 36 - 5a - 20 = 4 \]
  \[ 72 - 5a - 20 = 4 \]
  \[ 52 - 5a = 4 \]
  \[ 5a = 48 \]
  \[ a = 8 \]
  Thus, the smallest of the even integers is 8.
