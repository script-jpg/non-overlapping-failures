  To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest even integer \( a \) such that the sum of five consecutive even integers is four less than the sum of the first eight consecutive odd counting numbers. We are given that the smallest even integer \( a \) is 8.
  First, we express the sums of the consecutive even and odd numbers. The sum of the first eight odd numbers is given by:
  \[ \sum_{k=0}^{7} (2k + 1) \]
  The sum of the first five even numbers starting from \( a \) is given by:
  \[ \sum_{k=0}^{4} (a + 2k) \]
  According to the problem, the sum of the first eight odd numbers minus the sum of the first five even numbers equals 4:
  \[ \sum_{k=0}^{7} (2k + 1) - \sum_{k=0}^{4} (a + 2k) = 4 \]
  We simplify the sums using the properties of finite sums and the given value of \( a \). By expanding and simplifying the sums, we find that the equation holds true when \( a = 8 \).
