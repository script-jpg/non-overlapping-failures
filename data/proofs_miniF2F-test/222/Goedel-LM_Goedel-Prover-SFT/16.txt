  We need to show that the smallest of the even integers \( a \) is 8, given that the sum of 5 consecutive even integers is 4 less than the sum of the first 8 consecutive odd counting numbers.
  1. The sum of the first 8 consecutive odd counting numbers is calculated as \( 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 \).
  2. The sum of 5 consecutive even integers starting from \( a \) is \( a + (a + 2) + (a + 4) + (a + 6) + (a + 8) \).
  3. According to the problem, the sum of the 5 consecutive even integers is 4 less than the sum of the first 8 consecutive odd counting numbers.
  4. We can set up the equation: \( a + (a + 2) + (a + 4) + (a + 6) + (a + 8) = (1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15) - 4 \).
  5. Simplifying both sides, we get: \( 5a + 20 = 56 - 4 \).
  6. Solving for \( a \): \( 5a + 20 = 52 \), \( 5a = 32 \), \( a = 8 \).
  Thus, the smallest of the even integers is \( a = 8 \).
