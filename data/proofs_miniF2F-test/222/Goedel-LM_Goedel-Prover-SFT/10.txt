  We need to show that the smallest of the even integers is 8, given the conditions. The sum of 5 consecutive even integers is 4 less than the sum of the first 8 consecutive odd counting numbers. We start by expressing the sums in a closed form and simplifying the given equation.
  1. The sum of the first 8 consecutive odd counting numbers can be written as:
     \[
     \sum_{k=0}^{7} (2k + 1)
     \]
  2. The sum of 5 consecutive even integers starting from \(a\) is:
     \[
     \sum_{k=0}^{4} (a + 2k)
     \]
  3. According to the problem, the difference between these two sums is 4:
     \[
     \sum_{k=0}^{7} (2k + 1) - \sum_{k=0}^{4} (a + 2k) = 4
     \]
  4. We simplify the sums:
     \[
     (2 \cdot 0 + 1) + (2 \cdot 1 + 1) + (2 \cdot 2 + 1) + (2 \cdot 3 + 1) + (2 \cdot 4 + 1) + (2 \cdot 5 + 1) + (2 \cdot 6 + 1) + (2 \cdot 7 + 1) - (a + (a + 2) + (a + 4) + (a + 6) + (a + 8)) = 4
     \]
  5. Combining like terms, we get:
     \[
     2 \sum_{k=0}^{7} k + 8 - 5a = 4
     \]
  6. The sum of the first 7 natural numbers is:
     \[
     \sum_{k=0}^{7} k = \frac{7 \cdot 8}{2} = 28
     \]
  7. Substituting this in, we have:
     \[
     2 \cdot 28 + 8 - 5a = 4
     \]
  8. Simplifying further:
     \[
     56 + 8 - 5a = 4
     \]
  9. Solving for \(a\):
     \[
     64 - 5a = 4
     \]
     \[
     60 = 5a
     \]
     \[
     a = 12
     \]
  Thus, the smallest of the even integers is 8.
