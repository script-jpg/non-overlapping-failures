  We need to show that the smallest of the even integers is 8, given that the sum of 5 consecutive even integers is 4 less than the sum of the first 8 consecutive odd counting numbers.
  1. **Sum of the first 8 consecutive odd counting numbers**:
     - The sum of the first 8 odd numbers is \(1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15\).
     - This can be calculated as \(8^2 = 64\).
  2. **Sum of 5 consecutive even integers**:
     - Let the smallest even integer be \(a\).
     - The 5 consecutive even integers are \(a, a+2, a+4, a+6, a+8\).
     - The sum of these integers is \(a + (a+2) + (a+4) + (a+6) + (a+8) = 5a + 20\).
  3. **Given condition**:
     - The sum of the first 8 odd numbers is 4 more than the sum of the 5 consecutive even integers.
     - Therefore, \(64 = 5a + 20 + 4\).
  4. **Solving for \(a\)**:
     - \(64 = 5a + 24\)
     - \(64 - 24 = 5a\)
     - \(40 = 5a\)
     - \(a = 8\).
  Thus, the smallest of the even integers is 8.
