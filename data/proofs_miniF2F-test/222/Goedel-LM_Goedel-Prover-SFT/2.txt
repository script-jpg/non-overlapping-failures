  To show that the smallest of the even integers is 8, we start by analyzing the given conditions. The sum of 5 consecutive even integers is 4 less than the sum of the first 8 consecutive odd counting numbers. We need to find the smallest even integer \( a \) such that this condition holds.
  First, we express the sums of the first 8 odd counting numbers and the sum of 5 consecutive even integers. The sum of the first 8 odd counting numbers is given by:
  \[ \sum_{k=0}^{7} (2k + 1) \]
  The sum of 5 consecutive even integers starting from \( a \) is:
  \[ \sum_{k=0}^{4} (a + 2k) \]
  According to the problem, the sum of the first 8 odd counting numbers minus the sum of the 5 consecutive even integers equals 4:
  \[ \sum_{k=0}^{7} (2k + 1) - \sum_{k=0}^{4} (a + 2k) = 4 \]
  We simplify the sums:
  \[ \sum_{k=0}^{7} (2k + 1) = 2 \sum_{k=0}^{7} k + \sum_{k=0}^{7} 1 = 2 \left( \frac{7 \cdot 8}{2} \right) + 8 = 7 \cdot 8 + 8 = 56 + 8 = 64 \]
  \[ \sum_{k=0}^{4} (a + 2k) = a \cdot 5 + 2 \sum_{k=0}^{4} k = a \cdot 5 + 2 \left( \frac{4 \cdot 5}{2} \right) = 5a + 20 \]
  Thus, the equation becomes:
  \[ 64 - (5a + 20) = 4 \]
  Solving for \( a \):
  \[ 64 - 5a - 20 = 4 \]
  \[ 44 - 5a = 4 \]
  \[ 40 = 5a \]
  \[ a = 8 \]
  Therefore, the smallest even integer \( a \) is 8.
