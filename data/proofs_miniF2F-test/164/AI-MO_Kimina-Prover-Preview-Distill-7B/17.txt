-- let's first try to understand the problem
  -- we have positive real numbers x ≠ 1 and y ≠ 1
  -- they satisfy two equations:
  -- 1. log_2(x) = log_y(16)
  -- 2. x * y = 64
  -- and we need to find (log_2(x/y))^2

  -- first, let's extract the two equations from the hypotheses
  rcases h₀ with ⟨hx, hy⟩
  have h₃ : Real.log x / Real.log 2 = Real.log 16 / Real.log y := h₁
  have h₄ : x * y = 64 := h₂

  -- my plan is to first solve the system of equations to find x and y,
  -- then compute the value we need

  -- let's start by simplifying the equations
  -- log_2(x) = log_y(16) can be rewritten as log(x) / log(2) = log(16) / log(y)
  have h₅ : Real.log 16 = 4 * Real.log 2 := by
    calc
      Real.log 16 = Real.log (2^4) := by norm_num
      _ = 4 * Real.log 2 := by simp [Real.log_pow]

  -- so we have a simplified equation h₃: log(x) / log(2) = 4 * log(2) / log(y)
  rw [h₅] at h₃

  -- let's think about how to solve the system of equations now
  -- we have:
  -- 1. log(x) / log(2) = 4 * log(2) / log(y)
  -- 2. x * y = 64
  -- and we need to find (log(x/y) / log(2))^2

  -- from equation 1, we can write log(x) * log(y) = 4 * log(2) * log(2)
  have h₆ : Real.log x * Real.log y = 4 * Real.log 2 * Real.log 2 := by
    field_simp at h₃
    nlinarith

  -- and from equation 2, we have x * y = 64, so log(x) + log(y) = log(64)
  have h₇ : Real.log x + Real.log y = 6 * Real.log 2 := by
    calc
      Real.log x + Real.log y = Real.log (x * y) := by rw [Real.log_mul (by linarith) (by linarith)]
      _ = Real.log 64 := by rw [h₄]
      _ = Real.log (2^6) := by norm_num
      _ = 6 * Real.log 2 := by simp [Real.log_pow]

  -- i'll try to solve the system by eliminating variables
  -- from h₇: log(x) + log(y) = 6 * log(2)
  -- from h₆: log(x) * log(y) = 4 * log(2) * log(2)
  -- these are sum and product of log(x) and log(y)
  -- i wonder if i can solve for log(x) and log(y) from these equations

  -- let's set up the quadratic equation
  have h₈ : (Real.log x - 3 * Real.log 2) * (Real.log y - 3 * Real.log 2) = 5 * Real.log 2 * Real.log 2 := by
    nlinarith

  -- and this gives us two possibilities:
  -- 1. log(x) = 3log(2) + sqrt(15)log(2)
  -- 2. log(y) = 3log(2) + sqrt(15)log(2)
  -- but since x and y play symmetric roles in the original equations,
  -- i'll assume without loss of generality that
  -- log(x) = 3log(2) + sqrt(15)log(2)

  -- but wait, that's not right. let me recalculate
  -- actually, i get:
  -- (Real.log x - 3 * Real.log 2) ^ 2 = 5 * (Real.log 2 * Real.log 2)
  -- so the solutions are:
  -- log(x) = 3log(2) ± sqrt(5)log(2)
  -- and therefore:
  -- log(x) = (3 ± sqrt(5))log(2)

  -- and then:
  -- log(y) = 6log(2) - log(x) = 6log(2) - (3 ± sqrt(5))log(2) = (3 ∓ sqrt(5))log(2)

  -- so we have two cases:
  -- case 1:
  -- log(x) = (3 + sqrt(5))log(2)
  -- log(y) = (3 - sqrt(5))log(2)
  -- case 2:
  -- log(x) = (3 - sqrt(5))log(2)
  -- log(y) = (3 + sqrt(5))log(2)

  -- but in both cases, the value we want is the same:
  -- log(x/y) = log(x) - log(y) = (3 + sqrt(5))log(2) - (3 - sqrt(5))log(2) = 2sqrt(5)log(2)
  -- so (log(x/y) / log(2))^2 = (2sqrt(5))^2 = 4 * 5 = 20

  -- however, note that if we directly compute:
  -- log(x/y) = log(x) - log(y) = [(3 + sqrt(5))log(2)] - [(3 - sqrt(5))log(2)] = 2sqrt(5)log(2)
  -- so (log(x/y) / log(2))^2 = (2sqrt(5))^2 = 4 * 5 = 20

  -- so the answer is 20, corresponding to answer choice (B)

  -- now, let's implement this in Lean:

  -- first, we'll compute the value of (log(x) - 3log(2)) * (log(y) - 3log(2))
  have h₈ : (Real.log x - 3 * Real.log 2) * (Real.log y - 3 * Real.log 2) = 5 * Real.log 2 * Real.log 2 := by
    nlinarith

  -- and from this, we can solve for the possible values of log(x) and log(y)
  -- but actually, we don't need to determine x and y individually
  -- we just need to calculate (log(x/y) / log(2))^2

  -- note that:
  -- log(x/y) = log(x) - log(y)
  -- so (log(x/y) / log(2))^2 = (log(x) - log(y))^2 / (log(2) * log(2))

  -- from our equations, we can determine:
  -- (log(x) - 3log(2)) * (log(y) - 3log(2)) = 5(log(2) * log(2))
  -- expanding: log(x) * log(y) - 3log(2) * log(x) - 3log(2) * log(y) + 9log(2) * log(2) = 5log(2) * log(2)
  -- from h₇: log(x) + log(y) = 6log(2)
  -- so: log(x) * log(y) - 3log(2) * (log(x) + log(y)) + 9log(2) * log(2) = 5log(2) * log(2)
  -- therefore: log(x) * log(y) - 18log(2) * log(2) + 9log(2) * log(2) = 5log(2) * log(2)
  -- thus: log(x) * log(y) = 14log(2) * log(2)

  -- now, we compute the value we want:
  -- (log(x/y) / log(2))^2 = (log(x) - log(y))^2 / (log(2) * log(2))
  -- we can rewrite this as: (log(x)^2 - 2log(x)log(y) + log(y)^2) / (log(2) * log(2))
  -- from h₆: log(x) * log(y) = 4log(2) * log(2)
  -- so: (log(x)^2 - 2log(x)log(y) + log(y)^2) / (log(2) * log(2)) = (log(x)^2 + log(y)^2 - 8log(2)^2) / (log(2)^2)
  -- and from h₇: log(x) + log(y) = 6log(2)
  -- so: log(x)^2 + log(y)^2 + 2log(x)log(y) = 36log(2)^2
  -- therefore: log(x)^2 + log(y)^2 = 36log(2)^2 - 2log(x)log(y) = 36log(2)^2 - 8log(2)^2 = 28log(2)^2
  -- so: (log(x)^2 + log(y)^2 - 8log(2)^2) / (log(2)^2) = (28log(2)^2 - 8log(2)^2) / (log(2)^2) = 20

  -- so the value we're looking for is 20
  have h₉ : (Real.log (x / y) / Real.log 2) ^ 2 = 20 := by
    have h₁₀ : Real.log (x / y) = Real.log x - Real.log y := by
      rw [Real.log_div (by linarith) (by linarith)]
    rw [h₁₀]
    field_simp
    nlinarith

  -- and that's our final answer: 20
  exact h₉
