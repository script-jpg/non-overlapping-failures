  To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the composition of functions \( f \) and \( g \) at a specific point. Given \( f(x) = 2x - 3 \) and \( g(x) = x + 1 \), we need to find \( g(f(5) - 1) \).
  1. First, compute \( f(5) \):
     \[
     f(5) = 2 \cdot 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7
     \]
  2. Next, compute \( f(5) - 1 \):
     \[
     f(5) - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6
     \]
  3. Finally, compute \( g(6) \):
     \[
     g(6) = 6 + 1 = 7
     \]
  Thus, the value of \( g(f(5) - 1) \) is indeed 7.
