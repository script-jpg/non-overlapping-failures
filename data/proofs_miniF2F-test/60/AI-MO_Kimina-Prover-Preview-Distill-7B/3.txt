This completes the proof that $g(f(5)-1) = 7$.

The key insight is that we first compute the value of $f(5)$. Given $f(x) = 2x - 3$, substituting $x = 5$ gives $f(5) = 2 \cdot 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7$. 

Next, we compute $f(5) - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6$.

Then, we apply $g$ to this result. Given $g(x) = x + 1$, substituting $x = 6$ gives $g(6) = 6 + 1 = 7$.

So $g(f(5) - 1) = g(6) = 7$, which is our final answer.
