/- We can rewrite the goal as a series of equalities, from the inside out.

  Notice that we can rewrite $f(5)-1$ as $2*5-3-1 = 10-3-1 = 6$. Then, rewriting
  $g(f(5)-1)$ as $g(6) = 6+1 = 7$. -/

  /- Let's try to prove it with tactics. We should start by simplifying the
  term. We have $f(5) = 2\cdot 5-3 = 10-3 = 7$, so $f(5)-1 = 7-1 = 6$. Then
  $g(f(5)-1) = g(6) = 6+1 = 7$. -/
