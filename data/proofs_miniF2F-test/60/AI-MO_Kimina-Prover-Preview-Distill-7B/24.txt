The theorem statement defines $f(x) = 2x-3$ and $g(x) = x+1$ as functions from reals to reals. We need to prove that $g(f(5)-1) = 7$.

First, we compute $f(5)$. By definition, $f(5) = 2 \cdot 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7$.

Next, we compute $f(5) - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6$.

Finally, we compute $g(f(5)-1) = g(6) = 6 + 1 = 7$.

The proof follows these steps exactly, using `rw` (rewrite) to substitute the definitions of $f$ and $g$, and `norm_num` to verify the arithmetic calculations.
