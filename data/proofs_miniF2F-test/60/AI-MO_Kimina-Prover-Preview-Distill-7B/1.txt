  -- The value of $g(f(5)-1)$ is $g(6) = 6+1 = 7$.
  rw [this, h₁]

```

This proof is straightforward by directly applying the definitions of $f$ and $g$.

The key insight is that we first compute $f(5) = 2 \times 5 - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7$. 
Then, $f(5) - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6$. 
Next, we compute $g(6) = 6 + 1 = 7$. 

Therefore, $g(f(5) - 1) = 7$.
