  Given the equation \( |x-1| + |x| + |x+1| = x + 2 \), we need to show that \( 0 \leq x \leq 1 \). We will consider different cases based on the signs of \( x-1 \), \( x \), and \( x+1 \). For each case, we will simplify the absolute values and solve the resulting equations.
  1. **Case Analysis on Absolute Values**:
     - We split into cases based on whether \( x-1 \), \( x \), and \( x+1 \) are non-negative or non-positive.
     - For each combination of these cases, we simplify the absolute values using the properties of absolute values.
  2. **Simplification and Equation Solving**:
     - After simplifying the absolute values, we solve the resulting equations to find the range of \( x \) that satisfies the given equation.
     - We use algebraic manipulation and linear arithmetic to conclude that \( 0 \leq x \leq 1 \).
