  Given a real number \( x \) such that \( |x-1| + |x| + |x+1| = x + 2 \), we need to show that \( 0 \leq x \leq 1 \).
  1. **Case Analysis on Absolute Values**:
     - We consider different cases based on the signs of \( x-1 \), \( x \), and \( x+1 \).
     - For each combination of non-negative and non-positive values, we simplify the absolute values accordingly.
  2. **Simplification and Inequality Solving**:
     - Using the properties of absolute values, we simplify the given equation.
     - We then solve the resulting inequalities to find the range of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.
  3. **Conclusion**:
     - By analyzing all cases, we conclude that \( 0 \leq x \leq 1 \).
