  We need to show that for any real number \( x \), if \( |x-1| + |x| + |x+1| = x + 2 \), then \( 0 \leq x \leq 1 \).
  1. **Case Analysis on Absolute Values**:
     - Consider the cases where \( x - 1 \), \( x \), and \( x + 1 \) are either non-negative or non-positive.
     - This results in a total of \( 2^3 = 8 \) cases.
  2. **Simplifying the Equation**:
     - For each case, simplify the absolute values using the properties of absolute values.
     - Substitute the simplified expressions into the given equation \( |x-1| + |x| + |x+1| = x + 2 \).
  3. **Solving the Equation**:
     - For each case, solve the resulting equations to find the range of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.
     - Combine the results to conclude that \( 0 \leq x \leq 1 \).
