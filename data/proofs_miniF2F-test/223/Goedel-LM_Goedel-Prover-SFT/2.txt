  Given the equation \( |x-1| + |x| + |x+1| = x + 2 \), we need to show that \( 0 \leq x \leq 1 \). We will consider different cases based on the signs of \( x-1 \), \( x \), and \( x+1 \). For each case, we will use the properties of absolute values and simplify the equation accordingly. Finally, we will verify that the solution \( x \) satisfies \( 0 \leq x \leq 1 \).
