  Given a real number \( x \), we need to show that if \( |x-1| + |x| + |x+1| = x + 2 \), then \( 0 \leq x \leq 1 \).
  1. **Case Analysis on Absolute Values**:
     - We consider different cases based on the signs of \( x - 1 \), \( x \), and \( x + 1 \).
     - For each combination of signs, we simplify the absolute values using the properties of absolute values.
  2. **Simplification and Linear Equations**:
     - After simplifying the absolute values, we solve the resulting linear equations to find the constraints on \( x \).
  3. **Conclusion**:
     - Combining the constraints from all cases, we conclude that \( 0 \leq x \leq 1 \).
