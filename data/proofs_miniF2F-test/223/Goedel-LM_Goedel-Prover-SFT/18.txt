  We need to show that for any real number \( x \), if \( |x-1| + |x| + |x+1| = x + 2 \), then \( 0 \leq x \leq 1 \).
  1. **Case Analysis on \( x \)**:
     - Consider the cases where \( x - 1 \), \( x \), and \( x + 1 \) are either non-negative or non-positive.
     - For each combination of these cases, simplify the absolute values using the properties of absolute values.
  2. **Simplification and Equation Solving**:
     - After simplifying the absolute values, solve the resulting equations to find the range of \( x \) that satisfies the given equation.
  3. **Conclusion**:
     - Combine the results from all cases to conclude that \( 0 \leq x \leq 1 \).
