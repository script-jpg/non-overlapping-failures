  We need to show that for any real number \( x \), if \( |x-1| + |x| + |x+1| = x + 2 \), then \( 0 \leq x \leq 1 \).
  1. We start by considering the cases where \( x - 1 \), \( x \), and \( x + 1 \) are either non-negative or non-positive.
  2. For each combination of these cases, we simplify the absolute values using the properties of absolute values.
  3. We then solve the resulting equations to find the constraints on \( x \).
  4. Finally, we combine these constraints to conclude that \( 0 \leq x \leq 1 \).
