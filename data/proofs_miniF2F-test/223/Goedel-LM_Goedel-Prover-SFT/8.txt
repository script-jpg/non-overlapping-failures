  To show that for any real number \( x \), if \( |x-1| + |x| + |x+1| = x + 2 \), then \( 0 \leq x \leq 1 \), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Case Analysis on Absolute Values**: We consider different cases based on the signs of \( x - 1 \), \( x \), and \( x + 1 \).
  2. **Simplification and Linear Equations**: For each case, we simplify the given equation using the properties of absolute values and solve the resulting linear equations.
  3. **Verification of Solutions**: We verify that the solutions obtained from the equations are within the range \( 0 \leq x \leq 1 \).
