  To show that for any real number \( x \), if \( |x-1| + |x| + |x+1| = x + 2 \), then \( 0 \leq x \leq 1 \), we proceed as follows:
  1. Consider the cases where \( x-1 \), \( x \), and \( x+1 \) are either non-negative or non-positive.
  2. For each combination of these cases, simplify the absolute values using the properties of absolute values.
  3. Use the given equation \( |x-1| + |x| + |x+1| = x + 2 \) to derive constraints on \( x \).
  4. Combine these constraints to conclude that \( 0 \leq x \leq 1 \).
