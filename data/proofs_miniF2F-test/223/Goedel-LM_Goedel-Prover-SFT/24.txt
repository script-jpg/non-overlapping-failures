  Given a real number \( x \), we need to show that if \( |x-1| + |x| + |x+1| = x + 2 \), then \( 0 \leq x \leq 1 \).
  1. Consider the absolute values \( |x-1| \), \( |x| \), and \( |x+1| \).
  2. We can split into cases based on whether \( x-1 \), \( x \), and \( x+1 \) are non-negative or non-positive.
  3. For each combination of these cases, we simplify the absolute values using the properties of absolute values.
  4. We then solve the resulting equations and use algebraic manipulations to find the constraints on \( x \).
  5. Finally, we conclude that \( 0 \leq x \leq 1 \).
