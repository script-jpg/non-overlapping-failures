  To show that for any real number \( x \), if \( |x-1| + |x| + |x+1| = x + 2 \), then \( 0 \leq x \leq 1 \), we proceed by considering different cases based on the signs of \( x-1 \), \( x \), and \( x+1 \). We use the properties of absolute values and simplify the equations accordingly. Finally, we verify that the solutions satisfy the given conditions.
