  To show that for any real number \( x \), if \( |x - 1| + |x| + |x + 1| = x + 2 \), then \( 0 \leq x \leq 1 \), we will consider different cases based on the signs of \( x - 1 \), \( x \), and \( x + 1 \). We will use the properties of absolute values and linear equations to derive the necessary inequalities.
  1. **Case Analysis on Signs**:
     - We consider the cases where \( x - 1 \), \( x \), and \( x + 1 \) are non-negative or non-positive.
     - For each combination of these cases, we simplify the given equation using the properties of absolute values.
  2. **Simplification and Inequality Derivation**:
     - After simplifying the equation, we derive the inequalities \( 0 \leq x \) and \( x \leq 1 \) using algebraic manipulation and linear arithmetic.
