  We need to show that for any natural number \( n \), 12 divides \( 4^{n+1} + 20 \). We will use mathematical induction to prove this.
  **Base Case:**
  When \( n = 0 \), we have \( 4^{0+1} + 20 = 4^1 + 20 = 4 + 20 = 24 \). Since 12 divides 24, the base case holds.
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume that for some natural number \( n \), 12 divides \( 4^{n+1} + 20 \). We need to show that 12 divides \( 4^{(n+1)+1} + 20 \).
  Consider \( 4^{(n+1)+1} + 20 = 4^{n+2} + 20 \). We can rewrite this as:
  \[ 4^{n+2} + 20 = 4 \cdot 4^{n+1} + 20 \]
  Using the inductive hypothesis that 12 divides \( 4^{n+1} + 20 \), we can express \( 4^{n+1} + 20 \) as \( 12k \) for some integer \( k \). Thus:
  \[ 4 \cdot 4^{n+1} + 20 = 4 \cdot (12k - 20) + 20 = 48k - 80 + 20 = 48k - 60 \]
  Since 48k and 60 are both multiples of 12, \( 48k - 60 \) is also a multiple of 12. Therefore, 12 divides \( 4^{n+2} + 20 \).
  By induction, 12 divides \( 4^{n+1} + 20 \) for all natural numbers \( n \).
