  To show that for any natural number \( n \), 12 divides \( 4^{n+1} + 20 \), we can use the property of divisibility and modular arithmetic. Specifically, we will demonstrate that the remainder when \( 4^{n+1} + 20 \) is divided by 12 is zero. This can be achieved by examining the powers of 4 modulo 12 and using the periodicity of modular arithmetic.
