  We aim to show that for any natural number \( n \), 12 divides \( 4^{n+1} + 20 \). We will use mathematical induction to prove this statement.
  1. **Base Case**: When \( n = 0 \), we need to check if 12 divides \( 4^{0+1} + 20 \).
     \[
     4^{0+1} + 20 = 4^1 + 20 = 4 + 20 = 24
     \]
     Since 24 is divisible by 12, the base case holds.
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume that for some natural number \( n \), 12 divides \( 4^{n+1} + 20 \). We need to show that 12 divides \( 4^{(n+1)+1} + 20 \).
     \[
     4^{(n+1)+1} + 20 = 4^{n+2} + 20 = 4 \cdot 4^{n+1} + 20
     \]
     By the inductive hypothesis, 12 divides \( 4^{n+1} + 20 \), so we can write:
     \[
     4^{n+1} + 20 = 12k \text{ for some integer } k
     \]
     Therefore:
     \[
     4^{n+2} + 20 = 4 \cdot (4^{n+1} + 20) = 4 \cdot 12k = 48k
     \]
     Since 48k is clearly divisible by 12, the inductive step holds.
  By the principle of mathematical induction, we have shown that 12 divides \( 4^{n+1} + 20 \) for any natural number \( n \).
