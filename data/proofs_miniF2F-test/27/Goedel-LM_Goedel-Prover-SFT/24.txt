  We aim to show that for any natural number \( n \), 12 divides \( 4^{n+1} + 20 \). We will use mathematical induction to prove this statement.
  **Base Case: \( n = 0 \)**
  When \( n = 0 \), we have:
  \[ 4^{0+1} + 20 = 4^1 + 20 = 4 + 20 = 24 \]
  Since 24 is divisible by 12, the base case holds.
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume that for some natural number \( n \), 12 divides \( 4^{n+1} + 20 \). We need to show that 12 divides \( 4^{(n+1)+1} + 20 \).
  First, express \( 4^{(n+1)+1} + 20 \) in terms of \( 4^{n+1} + 20 \):
  \[ 4^{(n+1)+1} + 20 = 4 \cdot 4^{n+1} + 20 = 4 \cdot (4^{n+1} + 20 - 20) + 20 = 4 \cdot (4^{n+1} + 20) - 4 \cdot 20 + 20 \]
  \[ = 4 \cdot (4^{n+1} + 20) - 80 + 20 = 4 \cdot (4^{n+1} + 20) - 60 \]
  Since \( 4^{n+1} + 20 \) is divisible by 12 by the inductive hypothesis, we can write:
  \[ 4^{n+1} + 20 = 12k \]
  for some integer \( k \). Thus:
  \[ 4 \cdot (4^{n+1} + 20) - 60 = 4 \cdot (12k) - 60 = 48k - 60 \]
  Since \( 48k - 60 \) is clearly divisible by 12, the inductive step holds.
  By mathematical induction, 12 divides \( 4^{n+1} + 20 \) for all natural numbers \( n \).
