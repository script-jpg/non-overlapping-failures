  To show that for any natural number \( n \), 12 divides \( 4^{n+1} + 20 \), we can use mathematical induction. The base case is straightforward: \( 4^1 + 20 = 24 \), and since 24 is divisible by 12, the base case holds. For the inductive step, assume that \( 4^{k+1} + 20 \) is divisible by 12 for some natural number \( k \). We need to show that \( 4^{(k+1)+1} + 20 \) is also divisible by 12.
  First, express \( 4^{(k+1)+1} + 20 \) in terms of \( 4^{k+1} + 20 \):
  \[ 4^{(k+1)+1} + 20 = 4 \cdot 4^{k+1} + 20 \]
  Using the inductive hypothesis that \( 4^{k+1} + 20 \) is divisible by 12, we can write:
  \[ 4^{k+1} + 20 = 12m \]
  for some integer \( m \). Then:
  \[ 4 \cdot 4^{k+1} + 20 = 4 \cdot (12m - 20) + 20 = 48m - 80 + 20 = 48m - 60 \]
  Since \( 48m - 60 \) is clearly divisible by 12, we conclude that \( 4^{(k+1)+1} + 20 \) is divisible by 12. By induction, \( 4^{n+1} + 20 \) is divisible by 12 for all natural numbers \( n \).
