-- check by induction on n

  induction' n with n hn

  -- check for $n = 0$

 . use 2

    ring

  -- use the induction hypothesis and multiply both sides by $4$

  have h1 : 4 ^ (n + 1) + 20 = (4 ^ n + 5) * 4 := by

    ring

  rw [h1, mul_assoc]

  -- since $4 ^ n + 5$ and $4$ are both natural numbers, it follows by the induction hypothesis that $4 ^ (n + 1) + 20$ is divisible by $12$

  apply Nat.mul_dvd_mul hn (by norm_num)
