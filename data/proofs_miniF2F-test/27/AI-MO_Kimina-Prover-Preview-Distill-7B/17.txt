This proof checks that $4^{n+1} + 20$ is divisible by 12 for any natural number $n$ using induction. For $n = 0$, we have $4^{0+1} + 20 = 4 + 20 = 24$, which is divisible by 12. For the inductive step, assuming $4^{n+1} + 20$ is divisible by 12, we need to show that $4^{(n+1)+1} + 20$ is also divisible by 12. 

We have $4^{(n+1)+1} + 20 = 4 \cdot 4^{n+1} + 20 = 4^{n+1} + 20 + 3 \cdot 4^{n+1}$. Since $4^{n+1} + 20$ is divisible by 12 by the induction hypothesis, and $3 \cdot 4^{n+1}$ is clearly divisible by 12 (as $4^{n+1}$ is divisible by 4 and thus $3 \cdot 4^{n+1}$ is divisible by 48, which is divisible by 12), the sum is divisible by 12. 

Therefore, $4^{n+1} + 20$ is divisible by 12 for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$.
