This completes the proof that 12 divides $4^{n+1} + 20$ for any natural number $n$.

Now, let's move on to the second part of the problem:

---

The second part asks us to show that for any natural number $n$, 64 divides $81^{n+1} + 12 \cdot 9^{n+1}$.

Let's start by importing the necessary libraries and setting up the theorem statement:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

```

Now, let's define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem induction_64dvd81expnp1p12mul9expnp1 (n : ℕ) : 64 ∣ 81 ^ (n + 1) + 12 * 9 ^ (n + 1) := by
```

We'll prove this by induction on $n$.

For the base case $n = 0$, we have:
$81^{0+1} + 12 \cdot 9^{0+1} = 81^1 + 12 \cdot 9^1 = 81 + 12 \cdot 9 = 81 + 108 = 189$

And $64 \mid 189$ is false, so the base case doesn't hold. Let's check the next case.

For $n = 1$: $81^{1+1} + 12 \cdot 9^{1+1} = 81^2 + 12 \cdot 9^2 = 6561 + 12 \cdot 81 = 6561 + 972 = 7533$

And $64 \mid 7533$ is false. Let's continue checking.

For $n = 2$: $81^{2+1} + 12 \cdot 9^{2+1} = 81^3 + 12 \cdot 9^3 = 531441 + 12 \cdot 729 = 531441 + 8748 = 540189$

And $64 \mid 540189$ is false. Let's continue.

For $n = 3$: $81^{3+1} + 12 \cdot 9^{3+1} = 81^4 + 12 \cdot 9^4 = 6561 + 12 \cdot 6561 = 6561 + 78732 = 85293$

And $64 \mid 85293$ is false. Let's continue.

For $n = 4$: $81^{4+1} + 12 \cdot 9^{4+1} = 81^5 + 12 \cdot 9^5 = 6561 + 12 \cdot 59049 = 6561 + 708588 = 715149$

And $64 \mid 715149$ is false. Let's continue.

For $n = 5$: $81^{5+1} + 12 \cdot 9^{5+1} = 81^6 + 12 \cdot 9^6 = 81^6 + 12 \cdot 9^6 = 81^6 + 12 \cdot 9^6 =...$

This is getting tedious. Let's try a different approach.

Notice that $81 = 9^2$, so we can rewrite the expression as:
$(9^2)^{n+1} + 12 \cdot 9^{n+1} = 9^{2(n+1)} + 12 \cdot 9^{n+1} = 9^{2n+2} + 12 \cdot 9^{n+1}$

Now, let's try to find a pattern by factoring out $9^{n+1}$:
$9^{2n+2} + 12 \cdot 9^{n+1} = 9^{n+1}(9^{n+1} + 12)$

We need to show that $64 \mid 9^{n+1}(9^{n+1} + 12)$ for all $n \geq 0$.

For $n = 0$: $9^{0+1}(9^{0+1} + 12) = 9^1(9^1 + 12) = 9(9 + 12) = 9 \cdot 21 = 189$

And $64 \mid 189$ is false. 

It seems that the original claim is false. Let me re-evaluate the problem.

Wait, I see the issue. The pattern I was looking for was different. Let me try again.

$81^{n+1} + 12 \cdot 9^{n+1} = (9^2)^{n+1} + 12 \cdot 9^{n+1} = 9^{2(n+1)} + 12 \cdot 9^{n+1} = 9^{2n+2} + 12 \cdot 9^{n+1}$

Now, let's try to express this as a multiple of 64:

$9^{2n+2} + 12 \cdot 9^{n+1} = 64 \cdot k$ for some integer $k$

This is starting to look impossible. Let me check the base case again.

For $n = 0$: $81^1 + 12 \cdot 9^1 = 81 + 12 \cdot 9 = 81 + 108 = 189$

And $64 \mid 189$ is indeed false. 

The original claim must be incorrect. Let me reflect on why this happened.

When trying to prove this statement, I would have noticed that the base case doesn't hold, and therefore the entire statement is false. The Lean proof would reflect this by failing as well.

The Lean proof would start by checking the base case, which would fail, and then attempting to proceed with induction. However, since the base case is false, the entire induction proof would be invalid.

In conclusion, the claim that $64 \mid 81^{n+1} + 12 \cdot 9^{n+1}$ for all $n \geq 0$ is incorrect. The Lean proof would reveal this by failing on the base case.
