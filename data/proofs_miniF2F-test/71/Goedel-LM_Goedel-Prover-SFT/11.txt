  Given an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = \frac{2}{3} \) and the ninth term \( a_9 = \frac{4}{5} \), we need to find the fifth term \( a_5 \). The common difference \( d \) of the arithmetic sequence can be determined by the difference between any two consecutive terms. Using the properties of arithmetic sequences, we can express the fifth term in terms of the first and ninth terms. By solving for the common difference and substituting back, we find that the fifth term is \( \frac{11}{15} \).

  -- We start by finding the common difference `d` using the given terms.
  have d : ∀ n : ℕ, a (n + 1) - a n = a 2 - a 1 := fun n ↦ by
    -- Using the property of arithmetic sequences, we know that the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant.
    -- We use the given terms to find the common difference.
    linarith [h₀ n, h₀ 1, h₀ 2]
  -- Now we use the common difference to find the fifth term.
  have h₃ : a 5 = 11 / 15 := by
    -- We express the fifth term in terms of the first and ninth terms using the common difference.
    -- a_5 = a_1 + 4 * (a_2 - a_1)
    -- Given a_1 = 2/3 and a_9 = 4/5, we can solve for a_2 and then find a_5.
    linarith [h₀ 1, h₀ 2, h₀ 3, h₀ 4, h₀ 5, h₀ 6, h₀ 7, h₀ 8]
  -- Finally, we conclude that the fifth term is 11/15.
