  Given an arithmetic sequence where the first term is \(\frac{2}{3}\) and the ninth term is \(\frac{4}{5}\), we need to determine the fifth term. We start by using the property of arithmetic sequences that the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Let \(d\) be the common difference. We can express the terms of the sequence in terms of the first term and the common difference.
  Given:
  - \(a_1 = \frac{2}{3}\)
  - \(a_9 = \frac{4}{5}\)
  The terms of the sequence can be written as:
  \[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d \]
  Using the given information:
  \[ a_9 = a_1 + 8d \]
  Substituting the known values:
  \[ \frac{4}{5} = \frac{2}{3} + 8d \]
  Solving for \(d\):
  \[ \frac{4}{5} - \frac{2}{3} = 8d \]
  \[ \frac{12}{15} - \frac{10}{15} = 8d \]
  \[ \frac{2}{15} = 8d \]
  \[ d = \frac{2}{15 \cdot 8} = \frac{1}{60} \]
  Now, we find the fifth term:
  \[ a_5 = a_1 + 4d \]
  Substituting the known values:
  \[ a_5 = \frac{2}{3} + 4 \cdot \frac{1}{60} \]
  \[ a_5 = \frac{2}{3} + \frac{4}{60} \]
  \[ a_5 = \frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{15} \]
  \[ a_5 = \frac{10}{15} + \frac{1}{15} \]
  \[ a_5 = \frac{11}{15} \]
  Thus, the fifth term is \(\frac{11}{15}\).
