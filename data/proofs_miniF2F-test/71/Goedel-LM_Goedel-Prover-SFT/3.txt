  Given an arithmetic sequence \( a_n \) where the first term \( a_1 \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \) and the ninth term \( a_9 \) is \( \frac{4}{5} \), we need to find the fifth term \( a_5 \).
  First, we use the property of arithmetic sequences that the difference between consecutive terms is constant. This property allows us to express the terms of the sequence in terms of the first term and the common difference.
  Given:
  \[ a_1 = \frac{2}{3} \]
  \[ a_9 = \frac{4}{5} \]
  The common difference \( d \) can be found by considering the difference between any two consecutive terms. Specifically, we can use the difference between the first and second terms, the second and third terms, and so on, to find \( d \).
  Using the property of arithmetic sequences:
  \[ a_9 = a_1 + 8d \]
  Substituting the known values:
  \[ \frac{4}{5} = \frac{2}{3} + 8d \]
  Solving for \( d \):
  \[ \frac{4}{5} - \frac{2}{3} = 8d \]
  \[ \frac{12}{15} - \frac{10}{15} = 8d \]
  \[ \frac{2}{15} = 8d \]
  \[ d = \frac{1}{60} \]
  Now, we need to find the fifth term \( a_5 \):
  \[ a_5 = a_1 + 4d \]
  Substituting the known values:
  \[ a_5 = \frac{2}{3} + 4 \cdot \frac{1}{60} \]
  \[ a_5 = \frac{2}{3} + \frac{4}{60} \]
  \[ a_5 = \frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{15} \]
  \[ a_5 = \frac{10}{15} + \frac{1}{15} \]
  \[ a_5 = \frac{11}{15} \]
  Thus, the fifth term \( a_5 \) is \( \frac{11}{15} \).
