  Given an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 \) is \(\frac{2}{3}\) and the ninth term \( a_9 \) is \(\frac{4}{5}\), we need to find the fifth term \( a_5 \). The common difference \( d \) of the arithmetic sequence can be determined by the given terms. Using the property of arithmetic sequences, we can express the ninth term in terms of the first term and the common difference. By solving for the common difference and using it to find the fifth term, we find that the fifth term is \(\frac{11}{15}\).
