  Given an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \) and the ninth term \( a_9 \) is \( \frac{4}{5} \), we need to find the fifth term \( a_5 \).
  1. From the property of an arithmetic sequence, we know that the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Let \( d \) be the common difference.
  2. Using the given terms, we can express the ninth term in terms of the first term and the common difference:
     \[
     a_9 = a_1 + 8d
     \]
     Substituting the known values:
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} = \frac{2}{3} + 8d
     \]
  3. Solving for \( d \):
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} - \frac{2}{3} = 8d \implies \frac{12}{15} - \frac{10}{15} = 8d \implies \frac{2}{15} = 8d \implies d = \frac{1}{60}
     \]
  4. The fifth term \( a_5 \) can be expressed as:
     \[
     a_5 = a_1 + 4d
     \]
     Substituting the known values:
     \[
     a_5 = \frac{2}{3} + 4 \cdot \frac{1}{60} = \frac{2}{3} + \frac{4}{60} = \frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{15} = \frac{10}{15} + \frac{1}{15} = \frac{11}{15}
     \]
  Thus, the fifth term \( a_5 \) is \( \frac{11}{15} \).
