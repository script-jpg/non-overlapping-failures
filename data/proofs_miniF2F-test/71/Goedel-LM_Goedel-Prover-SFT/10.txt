  Given an arithmetic sequence where the first term is \(\frac{2}{3}\) and the ninth term is \(\frac{4}{5}\), we need to determine the fifth term and show that it is \(\frac{11}{15}\).
  1. Let \(a_n\) be the \(n\)-th term of the arithmetic sequence.
  2. By the properties of an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant, i.e., \(a_{n+2} - a_{n+1} = a_{n+1} - a_n\).
  3. Given \(a_1 = \frac{2}{3}\) and \(a_9 = \frac{4}{5}\), we can express \(a_9\) in terms of \(a_1\) and the common difference \(d\):
     \[
     a_9 = a_1 + 8d
     \]
  4. Substituting the known values:
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} = \frac{2}{3} + 8d
     \]
  5. Solving for \(d\):
     \[
     8d = \frac{4}{5} - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{12}{15} - \frac{10}{15} = \frac{2}{15}
     \]
     \[
     d = \frac{1}{60}
     \]
  6. To find \(a_5\), we use the common difference \(d\) and the first term \(a_1\):
     \[
     a_5 = a_1 + 4d = \frac{2}{3} + 4 \cdot \frac{1}{60} = \frac{2}{3} + \frac{4}{60} = \frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{15} = \frac{10}{15} + \frac{1}{15} = \frac{11}{15}
     \]
