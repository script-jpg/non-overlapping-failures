  Given an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \) and the ninth term \( a_9 \) is \( \frac{4}{5} \), we need to find the fifth term \( a_5 \). The common difference \( d \) of the arithmetic sequence can be determined by the difference between any two consecutive terms. Specifically, the common difference \( d \) can be calculated as \( d = a_{n+1} - a_n \). Using the given terms, we can set up the equation for the ninth term in terms of the first term and the common difference. By solving for the common difference and substituting back, we find that the fifth term \( a_5 \) is \( \frac{11}{15} \).

  -- We start by noting the given terms and the common difference.
  have h₃ := h₂
  have h₄ := h₁
  -- We need to find the common difference d.
  have d : ℝ := (a 2 - a 1)
  -- Using the common difference, we can express the ninth term in terms of the first term and d.
  have h₅ : a 9 = a 1 + 8 * d := by
    linarith [h₀ 1, h₀ 2, h₀ 3, h₀ 4, h₀ 5, h₀ 6, h₀ 7, h₀ 8]
  -- Substitute the known values to solve for d.
  rw [h₁] at h₅
  -- Simplify the equation to find d.
  norm_num at h₅
  -- Now we can find the fifth term using the common difference and the first term.
  have h₆ : a 5 = a 1 + 4 * d := by
    linarith [h₀ 1, h₀ 2, h₀ 3, h₀ 4]
  -- Substitute the known values and simplify.
  rw [h₁] at h₆
  -- Simplify the equation to find the fifth term.
  norm_num at h₆
  -- The final result is the fifth term.
  exact h₆
