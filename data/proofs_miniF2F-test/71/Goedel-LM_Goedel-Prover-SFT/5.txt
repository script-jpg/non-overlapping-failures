  Given an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 \) is \(\frac{2}{3}\) and the ninth term \( a_9 \) is \(\frac{4}{5}\), we need to find the fifth term \( a_5 \). We start by using the property of the arithmetic sequence that the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Using this property, we can express the terms in terms of the first term and the common difference. By solving for the common difference and using it to find the fifth term, we find that the fifth term is \(\frac{11}{15}\).
