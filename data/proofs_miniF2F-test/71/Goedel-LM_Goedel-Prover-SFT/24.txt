  Given an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = \frac{2}{3} \) and the ninth term \( a_9 = \frac{4}{5} \), we need to find the fifth term \( a_5 \). We know that the common difference \( d \) of the arithmetic sequence can be derived from the difference between any two terms. Specifically, we can use the given terms to express the fifth term in terms of the first and ninth terms. By leveraging the properties of arithmetic sequences and the given terms, we can solve for the fifth term.

  -- We start by expressing the fifth term in terms of the first and ninth terms.
  have h₃ : a 5 = 11 / 15 := by
    -- We use the given terms and the properties of arithmetic sequences to solve for the fifth term.
    -- Specifically, we use the fact that the common difference can be derived from the difference between any two terms.
    linarith [h₀ 1, h₀ 2, h₀ 3, h₀ 4, h₀ 5, h₀ 6, h₀ 7, h₀ 8, h₀ 9]
  -- Finally, we conclude that the fifth term is indeed 11/15.
