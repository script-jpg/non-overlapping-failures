  Given an arithmetic sequence where the first term is \(\frac{2}{3}\) and the ninth term is \(\frac{4}{5}\), we need to find the fifth term. Let \(a_n\) be the \(n\)-th term of the sequence. By the properties of an arithmetic sequence, the common difference \(d\) can be expressed as \(d = a_{n+1} - a_n\) for any \(n\). Using the given terms, we can derive the common difference and then compute the fifth term.
  1. **Determine the common difference**:
     - From the given terms, we have:
       \[
       a_9 = a_1 + 8d
       \]
     - Substituting the known values:
       \[
       \frac{4}{5} = \frac{2}{3} + 8d
       \]
     - Solving for \(d\):
       \[
       8d = \frac{4}{5} - \frac{2}{3}
       \]
       \[
       8d = \frac{12 - 10}{15}
       \]
       \[
       8d = \frac{2}{15}
       \]
       \[
       d = \frac{2}{15} \div 8
       \]
       \[
       d = \frac{2}{15} \times \frac{1}{8}
       \]
       \[
       d = \frac{2}{120} = \frac{1}{60}
       \]
  2. **Compute the fifth term**:
     - The fifth term \(a_5\) is given by:
       \[
       a_5 = a_1 + 4d
       \]
     - Substituting the known values:
       \[
       a_5 = \frac{2}{3} + 4 \times \frac{1}{60}
       \]
       \[
       a_5 = \frac{2}{3} + \frac{4}{60}
       \]
       \[
       a_5 = \frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{15}
       \]
       \[
       a_5 = \frac{10}{15} + \frac{1}{15}
       \]
       \[
       a_5 = \frac{11}{15}
       \]
  Thus, the fifth term is \(\frac{11}{15}\).
