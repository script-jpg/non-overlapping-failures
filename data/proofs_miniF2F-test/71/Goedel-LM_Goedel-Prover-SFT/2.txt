  Given an arithmetic sequence \( a \) where the first term \( a_1 = \frac{2}{3} \) and the ninth term \( a_9 = \frac{4}{5} \), we need to find the fifth term \( a_5 \).
  First, we express the common difference \( d \) of the arithmetic sequence in terms of the given terms. Since the sequence is arithmetic, the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant. Let \( d \) be the common difference.
  From the given terms:
  \[ a_1 = \frac{2}{3} \]
  \[ a_9 = \frac{4}{5} \]
  We can write:
  \[ a_9 = a_1 + 8d \]
  Substituting the known values:
  \[ \frac{4}{5} = \frac{2}{3} + 8d \]
  Solving for \( d \):
  \[ \frac{4}{5} - \frac{2}{3} = 8d \]
  \[ \frac{12}{15} - \frac{10}{15} = 8d \]
  \[ \frac{2}{15} = 8d \]
  \[ d = \frac{1}{60} \]
  Now, we can find the fifth term \( a_5 \):
  \[ a_5 = a_1 + 4d \]
  Substituting the known values:
  \[ a_5 = \frac{2}{3} + 4 \cdot \frac{1}{60} \]
  \[ a_5 = \frac{2}{3} + \frac{4}{60} \]
  \[ a_5 = \frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{15} \]
  \[ a_5 = \frac{10}{15} + \frac{1}{15} \]
  \[ a_5 = \frac{11}{15} \]
  Thus, the fifth term \( a_5 \) is \( \frac{11}{15} \).
