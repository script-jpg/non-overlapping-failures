  Given an arithmetic sequence where the first term is \(\frac{2}{3}\) and the ninth term is \(\frac{4}{5}\), we need to determine the fifth term. We start by using the property of arithmetic sequences that the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Using this property, we can express the terms in terms of the first term and the common difference. By solving for the common difference and substituting back, we find that the fifth term is \(\frac{11}{15}\).
