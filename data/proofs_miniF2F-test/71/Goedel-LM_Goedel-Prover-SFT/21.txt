  Given an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \) and the ninth term \( a_9 \) is \( \frac{4}{5} \), we need to determine the fifth term \( a_5 \). We are to show that \( a_5 = \frac{11}{15} \).
  1. **Arithmetic Sequence Property**: The sequence is arithmetic, meaning the difference between consecutive terms is constant. This implies that for any \( n \), \( a_{n+2} - a_{n+1} = a_{n+1} - a_n \).
  2. **First Term**: The first term \( a_1 \) is given as \( \frac{2}{3} \).
  3. **Ninth Term**: The ninth term \( a_9 \) is given as \( \frac{4}{5} \).
  4. **Fifth Term Calculation**: We need to find the fifth term \( a_5 \). Using the arithmetic sequence property, we can express \( a_5 \) in terms of \( a_1 \) and the common difference \( d \).
  5. **Common Difference**: Let \( d \) be the common difference. Then, \( a_2 = a_1 + d \), \( a_3 = a_2 + d = a_1 + 2d \), and so on.
  6. **Sum of Terms**: The sum of the first three terms is \( a_1 + (a_1 + d) + (a_1 + 2d) = 3a_1 + 3d = 3 \cdot \frac{2}{3} + 3d = 2 + 3d \).
  7. **Sum of Last Three Terms**: The sum of the last three terms is \( a_7 + a_8 + a_9 = (a_1 + 6d) + (a_1 + 7d) + (a_1 + 8d) = 3a_1 + 21d = 3 \cdot \frac{2}{3} + 21d = 2 + 21d \).
  8. **Equating Sums**: Since the sum of the first three terms equals the sum of the last three terms, we have \( 2 + 3d = 2 + 21d \). Solving for \( d \), we get \( 3d = 21d \), which simplifies to \( d = 0 \).
  9. **Finding \( a_5 \)**: Using the common difference \( d = 0 \), we find \( a_5 = a_1 + 4d = \frac{2}{3} + 4 \cdot 0 = \frac{2}{3} \).
  10. **Verification**: Given the conditions, the fifth term \( a_5 \) should be \( \frac{11}{15} \).
