  Given an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = \frac{2}{3} \) and the ninth term \( a_9 = \frac{4}{5} \), we need to find the fifth term \( a_5 \). By the properties of an arithmetic sequence, we know that the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Let \( d \) be the common difference.
  Using the property of the arithmetic sequence:
  \[ a_{n+2} - a_{n+1} = a_{n+1} - a_n \]
  We can express \( a_9 \) in terms of \( a_1 \) and \( d \):
  \[ a_9 = a_1 + 8d \]
  Given \( a_1 = \frac{2}{3} \) and \( a_9 = \frac{4}{5} \), we substitute these values into the equation:
  \[ \frac{4}{5} = \frac{2}{3} + 8d \]
  Solving for \( d \):
  \[ \frac{4}{5} - \frac{2}{3} = 8d \]
  \[ \frac{12 - 10}{15} = 8d \]
  \[ \frac{2}{15} = 8d \]
  \[ d = \frac{2}{15} \div 8 \]
  \[ d = \frac{2}{15} \times \frac{1}{8} \]
  \[ d = \frac{2}{120} \]
  \[ d = \frac{1}{60} \]
  Now, we find \( a_5 \):
  \[ a_5 = a_1 + 4d \]
  \[ a_5 = \frac{2}{3} + 4 \times \frac{1}{60} \]
  \[ a_5 = \frac{2}{3} + \frac{4}{60} \]
  \[ a_5 = \frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{15} \]
  \[ a_5 = \frac{10}{15} + \frac{1}{15} \]
  \[ a_5 = \frac{11}{15} \]
  Thus, the fifth term \( a_5 \) is \( \frac{11}{15} \).
