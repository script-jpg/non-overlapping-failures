  Given an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = \frac{2}{3} \) and the ninth term \( a_9 = \frac{4}{5} \), we need to find the fifth term \( a_5 \). The common difference \( d \) of the arithmetic sequence can be derived using the given terms. Specifically, the common difference \( d \) is calculated as the difference between any two consecutive terms. Using the given terms, we can express the ninth term in terms of the first term and the common difference. By solving for the common difference and substituting it back into the expression for the fifth term, we find that the fifth term is \( \frac{11}{15} \).

  -- The common difference d is the difference between any two consecutive terms.
  have d : a 2 - a 1 = a 3 - a 2 := by
    -- Using the arithmetic sequence property, we equate the differences.
    linarith [h₀ 1, h₀ 2]
  -- We now have the common difference d.
  have d2 : a 3 - a 2 = a 4 - a 3 := by
    -- Similarly, we equate the differences.
    linarith [h₀ 2, h₀ 3]
  have d3 : a 4 - a 3 = a 5 - a 4 := by
    -- We continue to equate the differences.
    linarith [h₀ 3, h₀ 4]
  have d4 : a 5 - a 4 = a 6 - a 5 := by
    -- We continue to equate the differences.
    linarith [h₀ 4, h₀ 5]
  have d5 : a 6 - a 5 = a 7 - a 6 := by
    -- We continue to equate the differences.
    linarith [h₀ 5, h₀ 6]
  have d6 : a 7 - a 6 = a 8 - a 7 := by
    -- We continue to equate the differences.
    linarith [h₀ 6, h₀ 7]
  have d7 : a 8 - a 7 = a 9 - a 8 := by
    -- We continue to equate the differences.
    linarith [h₀ 7, h₀ 8]
  have d8 : a 9 - a 8 = a 10 - a 9 := by
    -- We continue to equate the differences.
    linarith [h₀ 8, h₀ 9]
  -- Using the common difference and the given terms, we solve for the fifth term.
  linarith [h₁, h₂, d, d2, d3, d4, d5, d6, d7, d8]
