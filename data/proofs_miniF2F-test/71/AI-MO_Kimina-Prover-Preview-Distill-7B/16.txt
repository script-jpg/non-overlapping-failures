-- the first and ninth terms of an arithmetic sequence are $\frac23$ and $\frac45$, respectively.
  -- What is the fifth term?

  -- Let the first term be a and the common difference be d.
  let a' := a 1
  let d := a (1 + 1) - a 1

  -- It is well known that the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by: a_n = a + (n - 1) * d
  have h (n : ℕ) : a (1 + n) = a' + n * d := by
    induction n with
    | zero => simp
    | succ n ih =>
      rw [Nat.add_succ, ih]
      simp [d]
      linarith only [h₀ (1 + n)]
      -- the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by: a_n = a + (n - 1) * d

  -- the fifth term is: a_5 = a + 4 * d
  have h' : a 5 = a' + 4 * d := by
    rw [h 4]

  -- the first term is: a_1 = a
  have h'' : a 1 = a' := by

  -- the ninth term is: a_9 = a + 8 * d
  have h''': a 9 = a' + 8 * d := by
    rw [h 8]

  -- So, a_5 = (a_1 + a_9) / 2
  have h'''' : a 5 = (a' + a' + 8 * d) / 2 := by

  have h'''' : a 5 = (a 1 + a 9) / 2 := by
