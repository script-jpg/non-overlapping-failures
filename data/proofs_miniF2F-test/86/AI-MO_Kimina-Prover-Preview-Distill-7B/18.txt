-- According to the problem, we have two equations: `x + y = 25` and `x - y = 11`.
  -- We need to find the value of `x`, which is the larger of the two numbers.

  -- We can solve this system of equations by adding the two equations:
  -- `(x + y) + (x - y) = 25 + 11`
  -- `2x = 36`
  -- `x = 18`

  have h_add : x + y + (x - y) = 25 + 11 := by rw [h₀, h₁]
  have h2 : 2 * x = 36 := by linarith
  have hx : x = 18 := by linarith

  -- The larger of the two numbers is indeed 18.

  exact hx
