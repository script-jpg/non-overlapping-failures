-- According to the problem, we have two equations: $x + y = 25$ and $x - y = 11$.

  -- We can solve this system of equations to find the value of $x$.

  -- By adding the two equations, we get: $(x + y) + (x - y) = 25 + 11$, which simplifies to $2x = 36$.

  have h2 : 2 * x = 36 := by linarith

  -- Solving for $x$, we divide both sides by 2, yielding $x = 18$.

This completes the proof that the larger of the two numbers is indeed 18.

The key insight was that by adding the two given equations $x + y = 25$ and $x - y = 11$, we eliminated $y$ and were able to solve directly for $x$. This is a classic example of the method of elimination in solving systems of linear equations. The resulting equation $2x = 36$ is simple enough to solve for $x$ by division, giving us $x = 18$. Therefore, the larger of the two numbers is 18.
