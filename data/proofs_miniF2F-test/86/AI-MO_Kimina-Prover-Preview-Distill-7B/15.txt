-- The sum of two numbers is 25
  -- The difference of two numbers is 11
  -- what is the larger of the two numbers?

  have h : x = 18 := by linarith

  exact h
```

The Lean proof is remarkably concise because Lean's `linarith` tactic is powerful enough to solve systems of linear arithmetic goals directly. In this case, we have two equations:
1. $x + y = 25$
2. $x - y = 11$

If we add these two equations, we get:
$(x + y) + (x - y) = 25 + 11$
$2x = 36$
$x = 18$

So indeed, the larger of the two numbers is 18. Lean's `linarith` tactic is able to derive this conclusion directly from the given hypotheses `h₀` and `h₁` without requiring us to manually manipulate the equations. This demonstrates how Lean can efficiently solve straightforward arithmetic problems that would typically require algebraic manipulation by hand.

In summary, the Lean 4 proof shows that given the constraints that the sum of two numbers is 25 and their difference is 11, the larger number must be 18. The proof is elegant in its simplicity, leveraging Lean's built-in capabilities to solve the system of equations directly.
