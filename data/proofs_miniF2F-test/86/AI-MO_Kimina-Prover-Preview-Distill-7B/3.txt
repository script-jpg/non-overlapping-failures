-- The sum of two numbers is 25 and their difference is 11. What is the larger of the two numbers? Show that it is 18.

  -- x + y = 25
  -- x - y = 11
  -- 2x = 36
  -- x = 18
  have h : 2 * x = 36 := by linarith
  linarith

```

This completes the proof. The value of $x$ is indeed 18, confirming that the larger of the two numbers is $\boxed{18}$.
