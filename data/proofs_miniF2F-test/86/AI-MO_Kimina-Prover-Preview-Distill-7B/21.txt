-- According to the problem, we have two equations: $x + y = 25$ and $x - y = 11$.

  -- We want to find the value of $x$.

  -- We can solve this system of equations by adding the two equations to eliminate $y$.

  have h2 : x = 18 := by linarith

  -- The `linarith` tactic is powerful for solving linear arithmetic goals.

  -- It takes our two hypotheses `h₀` and `h₁` and adds them together:

  -- $(x + y) + (x - y) = 25 + 11$

  -- This simplifies to $2x = 36$.

  -- Therefore, $x = 18$.
