-- According to the problem, we have two equations: $x + y = 25$ and $x - y = 11$.

  -- We want to find the value of $x$.

  -- We can solve this system of equations by adding the two equations to eliminate $y$.

  have h2 : x = 18 := by linarith

  -- The `linarith` tactic is powerful enough to solve linear arithmetic goals. It takes the two hypotheses `h₀` and `h₁` and combines them to conclude that $x = 18$.

  -- Specifically, if we add the two equations $x + y = 25$ and $x - y = 11$, we get:
  -- $$ (x + y) + (x - y) = 25 + 11 $$
  -- $$ 2x = 36 $$
  -- $$ x = 18 $$

  exact h2

  -- The `exact` tactic is used to provide the exact proof of the goal. In this case, `h2` is exactly the statement `x = 18` that we want to prove.
