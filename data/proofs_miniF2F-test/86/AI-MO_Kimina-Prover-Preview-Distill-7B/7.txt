-- According to the problem, we have two equations: `x + y = 25` and `x - y = 11`. We need to find the value of `x`.

  -- We can solve this system of equations by adding the two equations together. 
  -- Adding them gives: `(x + y) + (x - y) = 25 + 11`
  -- Which simplifies to: `2x = 36`
  -- Therefore, `x = 18`
  have h : 2 * x = 36 := by linarith
