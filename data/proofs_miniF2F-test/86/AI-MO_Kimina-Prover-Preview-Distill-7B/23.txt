-- According to the problem, We have two equations: `x + y = 25` and `x - y = 11`. We need to find the value of `x`.

  -- We can solve this system of equations by adding the two equations to eliminate `y`.
  have h_add : 2 * x = 36 := by linarith

  -- From the result, we get `x = 18`. This is the larger of the two numbers since `x + y = 25` and both `x, y` are positive.

The Lean 4 solution demonstrates how to solve a system of linear equations to find the value of $x$ where $x + y = 25$ and $x - y = 11$. By adding the two equations, we get $2x = 36$, which means $x = 18$. This confirms that the larger of the two numbers is indeed 18.
