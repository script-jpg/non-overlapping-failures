-- According to the problem, we have two equations: $x + y = 25$ and $x - y = 11$.

  -- We can solve this system of equations by adding the two equations to eliminate $y$.
  have h : x = 18 := by linarith

  -- After adding the equations, we get $2x = 36$, which implies $x = 18$.

  -- Therefore, the larger of the two numbers is indeed 18.
  exact h
