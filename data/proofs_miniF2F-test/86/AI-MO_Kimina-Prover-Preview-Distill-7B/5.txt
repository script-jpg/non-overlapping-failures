-- The sum of two numbers is 25
  -- The difference of two numbers is 11
  -- what is the larger of the two numbers?
  -- show that it is 18

  -- We need to solve a system of two equations with two unknowns.
  -- then we can get the answer of x

  -- first, we get the answer by hand.
  -- x + y = 25
  -- x - y = 11
  -- add these two equations, we get 2*x = 36, so x = 18

  -- now, we translate it to lean4.
  have h : 2 * x = 36 := by linarith [h₀, h₁]
  -- we get 2*x = 36, so x = 18
  linarith
