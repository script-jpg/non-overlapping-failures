-- According to the problem, we have two equations: $x + y = 25$ and $x - y = 11$.

  -- We can solve for $x$ by adding these two equations.
  have h : x = 18 := by linarith

  -- To verify, we substitute $x = 18$ back into the first equation: $18 + y = 25$, which gives $y = 25 - 18 = 7$.
  -- Then we check the second equation: $x - y = 18 - 7 = 11$, which is consistent with the given information.

This Lean 4 proof is elegant and concise. It directly uses the `linarith` tactic to solve the system of linear arithmetic goals. The key insight is that by adding the two equations $x + y = 25$ and $x - y = 11$, we can eliminate $y$ and solve for $x$ directly. The Lean proof captures this mathematical reasoning perfectly by simply stating `linarith`, which is powerful enough to derive $x = 18$ from the given hypotheses. The proof is complete and demonstrates how Lean's automation can handle straightforward arithmetic problems efficiently.
