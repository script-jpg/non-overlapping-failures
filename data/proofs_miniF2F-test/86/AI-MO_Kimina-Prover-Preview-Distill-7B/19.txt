-- We have a system of two equations with two variables. There are several ways to solve it.
  -- For instance, we can use `linarith` tactic, which is powerful enough to solve systems of linear equations and inequalities.
  linarith

  -- We can also solve it be using more basic tactics. For example, we can add the two equations to get $2x = 36$.
  have h₂ : 2 * x = 36 := by linarith

  -- Then, we can use `linarith` tactic again to get $x = 18$.
