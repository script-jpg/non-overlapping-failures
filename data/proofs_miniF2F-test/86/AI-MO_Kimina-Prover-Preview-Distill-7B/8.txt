-- According to the problem, we have two equations: `x + y = 25` and `x - y = 11`.
  -- We need to find the value of `x`, which is the larger of the two numbers.

  -- We can solve this system of equations by adding the two equations together.
  -- Adding them gives: `(x + y) + (x - y) = 25 + 11`.
  have h : (x + y) + (x - y) = 25 + 11 := by rw [h₀, h₁]
  -- Simplifying the left side: `x + y + x - y = 2x`.
  rw [add_assoc, sub_add_cancel] at h
  -- So we get `2x = 36`.
  -- Dividing both sides by 2 gives: `x = 18`.
