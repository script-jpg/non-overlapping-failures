  Given two real numbers \( x \) and \( y \), we know that their sum is 25 and their difference is 11. We need to show that the larger number \( x \) is 18.
  First, we solve the system of equations:
  \[
  \begin{cases}
  x + y = 25 \\
  x - y = 11
  \end{cases}
  \]
  By adding these two equations, we eliminate \( y \):
  \[
  (x + y) + (x - y) = 25 + 11 \implies 2x = 36 \implies x = 18
  \]
  Thus, the larger number \( x \) is indeed 18.

  have h₂ : x = 18 := by
    -- Adding the two given equations to eliminate y.
    have h₃ : 2 * x = 36 := by
