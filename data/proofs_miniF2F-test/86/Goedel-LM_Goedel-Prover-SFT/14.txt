  Given the equations \( x + y = 25 \) and \( x - y = 11 \), we need to find the value of \( x \). By adding the two equations, we eliminate \( y \) and solve for \( x \).
  1. Start with the given equations:
     \[
     x + y = 25
     \]
     \[
     x - y = 11
     \]
  2. Add the two equations together:
     \[
     (x + y) + (x - y) = 25 + 11
     \]
  3. Simplify the left-hand side:
     \[
     x + y + x - y = 2x
     \]
  4. Combine like terms on the right-hand side:
     \[
     2x = 36
     \]
  5. Solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{36}{2} = 18
     \]
  Thus, the value of \( x \) is \( 18 \).

  have h : x = 18 := by
    -- Add the two equations: (x + y) + (x - y) = 25 + 11
    have h₂ : 2 * x = 36 := by
      linarith
    -- Solve for x: x = 36 / 2
    linarith
  -- The value of x is 18.
