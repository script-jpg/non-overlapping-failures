  Given two real numbers \( x \) and \( y \) such that their sum is 25 and their difference is 11, we need to show that the larger of the two numbers is 18.
  1. From the given equations \( x + y = 25 \) and \( x - y = 11 \), we can solve for \( x \) and \( y \).
  2. Adding the two equations, we get \( 2x = 36 \), which simplifies to \( x = 18 \).
  3. Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get \( 2y = 14 \), which simplifies to \( y = 7 \).
  4. Since \( x = 18 \) and \( y = 7 \), and \( x \) is greater than \( y \), the larger number is indeed 18.

  -- Adding the two given equations to eliminate y and solve for x.
  have h₂ : 2 * x = 36 := by linarith
  -- Dividing by 2 to solve for x.
  have h₃ : x = 18 := by linarith
  -- The final result showing that x is 18.
  exact h₃
