  Given two real numbers \( x \) and \( y \), we know that their sum is 25 and their difference is 11. We need to show that the larger of the two numbers is 18.
  First, we solve the system of equations:
  \[
  \begin{cases}
  x + y = 25 \\
  x - y = 11
  \end{cases}
  \]
  By adding these two equations, we eliminate \( y \):
  \[
  (x + y) + (x - y) = 25 + 11 \implies 2x = 36 \implies x = 18
  \]
  Thus, the larger of the two numbers is indeed 18.

  -- We solve the system of equations by adding the two given equations.
  have h₂ : x = 18 := by
    -- Adding the two equations:
    -- (x + y) + (x - y) = 25 + 11
    -- This simplifies to:
    -- 2x = 36
    -- Solving for x, we get:
    -- x = 18
    linarith
  -- We have already derived that x = 18, so we simply use this result.
