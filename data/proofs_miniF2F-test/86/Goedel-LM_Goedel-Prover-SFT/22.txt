  Given two real numbers \( x \) and \( y \) such that their sum is 25 and their difference is 11, we need to show that the larger of the two numbers is 18.
  1. Start with the given equations:
     \[
     x + y = 25
     \]
     \[
     x - y = 11
     \]
  2. Solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of \( x \) and \( y \).
  3. Add the two equations to eliminate \( y \):
     \[
     (x + y) + (x - y) = 25 + 11
     \]
     \[
     2x = 36
     \]
     \[
     x = 18
     \]
  4. Substitute \( x = 18 \) back into one of the original equations to find \( y \):
     \[
     18 + y = 25
     \]
     \[
     y = 7
     \]
  5. Since \( x = 18 \) and \( y = 7 \), and \( x \) is greater than \( y \), the larger number is indeed 18.

  -- We need to solve the system of equations:
  -- 1. x + y = 25
  -- 2. x - y = 11
  -- To find the value of x, we can add these two equations.
  have x_eq : x = 18 := by
    -- Adding the two equations:
    -- (x + y) + (x - y) = 25 + 11
    -- 2x = 36
    -- x = 18
    have h₂ : 2 * x = 36 := by linarith
    linarith
  -- Now we have the value of x, which is 18.
  -- We can substitute this value back into one of the original equations to find y.
  have y_eq : y = 7 := by
    -- Substituting x = 18 into x + y = 25:
    -- 18 + y = 25
    -- y = 7
    linarith
  -- Since x = 18 and y = 7, and x is greater than y, the larger number is 18.
