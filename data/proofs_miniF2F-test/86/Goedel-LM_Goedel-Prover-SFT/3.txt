  Given the equations \( x + y = 25 \) and \( x - y = 11 \), we need to find the value of \( x \). By adding these two equations, we eliminate \( y \) and solve for \( x \).
  1. Start with the given equations:
     \[
     x + y = 25
     \]
     \[
     x - y = 11
     \]
  2. Add the two equations together:
     \[
     (x + y) + (x - y) = 25 + 11
     \]
  3. Simplify the left-hand side:
     \[
     x + y + x - y = 2x
     \]
  4. Simplify the right-hand side:
     \[
     25 + 11 = 36
     \]
  5. Equate the simplified expressions:
     \[
     2x = 36
     \]
  6. Solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{36}{2} = 18
     \]
  Thus, the value of \( x \) is \( 18 \).

  -- We start by adding the two given equations to eliminate y and solve for x.
  have h : 2 * x = 36 := by
    -- Add the equations x + y = 25 and x - y = 11.
    linarith [h₀, h₁]
  -- Now we have 2 * x = 36. Solving for x, we divide both sides by 2.
  have h₂ : x = 18 := by
    -- Divide both sides of 2 * x = 36 by 2.
    linarith
  -- The result x = 18 is the desired solution.
  exact h₂
