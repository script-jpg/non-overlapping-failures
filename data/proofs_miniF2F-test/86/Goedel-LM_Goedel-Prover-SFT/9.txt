  Given two real numbers \( x \) and \( y \), we know that their sum is 25 and their difference is 11. We need to show that the larger of the two numbers, \( x \), is 18.
  First, we solve the system of equations:
  1. \( x + y = 25 \)
  2. \( x - y = 11 \)
  By adding these two equations, we eliminate \( y \):
  \[ (x + y) + (x - y) = 25 + 11 \]
  \[ 2x = 36 \]
  \[ x = 18 \]
  Thus, the larger number \( x \) is indeed 18.

  -- We solve the system of equations step by step.
  have h₂ : x = 18 := by
    -- Adding the two given equations to eliminate y:
    have h₃ : 2 * x = 36 := by
