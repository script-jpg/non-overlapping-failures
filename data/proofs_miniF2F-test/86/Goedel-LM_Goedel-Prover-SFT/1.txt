  Given the equations \( x + y = 25 \) and \( x - y = 11 \), we need to find the value of \( x \). We can solve this system of linear equations by adding and subtracting the equations to eliminate \( y \). First, we add the two equations to eliminate \( y \):
  \[
  (x + y) + (x - y) = 25 + 11
  \]
  This simplifies to:
  \[
  2x = 36
  \]
  Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
  \[
  x = 18
  \]
  Next, we verify that \( y \) can be determined by substituting \( x = 18 \) back into one of the original equations. Using \( x + y = 25 \):
  \[
  18 + y = 25
  \]
  Solving for \( y \):
  \[
  y = 25 - 18
  \]
  \[
  y = 7
  \]
  Thus, the larger number \( x \) is indeed 18.
