  Given the equations \( x + y = 25 \) and \( x - y = 11 \), we need to find the value of \( x \). By adding these two equations, we eliminate \( y \) and solve for \( x \). Specifically, we add \( x + y = 25 \) and \( x - y = 11 \) to get \( 2x = 36 \). Dividing both sides by 2, we find \( x = 18 \).

  -- We start by adding the two given equations to eliminate y and solve for x.
  have h₂ : 2 * x = 36 := by
    -- Adding the two equations x + y = 25 and x - y = 11 gives 2x = 36.
    linarith
  -- Now we have 2x = 36. Dividing both sides by 2, we solve for x.
  have h₃ : x = 18 := by
    -- Dividing both sides of 2x = 36 by 2 gives x = 18.
    linarith
  -- We have shown that x = 18, so we can conclude the proof.
