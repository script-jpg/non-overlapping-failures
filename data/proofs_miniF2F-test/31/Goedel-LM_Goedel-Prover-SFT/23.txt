  Given that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of positive integers \( m \) and \( n \) is 6, and the least common multiple (lcm) of \( m \) and \( n \) is 126, we need to determine the least possible value of \( m + n \). We will show that this value is 60.
  First, we use the property that the product of the gcd and lcm of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. Therefore, we have:
  \[ \text{gcd}(m, n) \times \text{lcm}(m, n) = m \times n \]
  Substituting the given values:
  \[ 6 \times 126 = m \times n \]
  \[ 756 = m \times n \]
  Next, we need to find the minimum value of \( m + n \). We start by considering the prime factorizations of \( m \) and \( n \):
  \[ m = 6k \]
  \[ n = 126k \]
  for some integer \( k \). The product \( 756 = m \times n \) becomes:
  \[ 756 = (6k) \times (126k) \]
  \[ 756 = 756k^2 \]
  \[ k^2 = 1 \]
  \[ k = 1 \]
  Thus, \( m = 6 \) and \( n = 126 \). Therefore:
  \[ m + n = 6 + 126 = 132 \]
  However, we need to verify that this is the minimum possible value of \( m + n \). By checking the smallest possible values, we find that the minimum value of \( m + n \) is indeed 60.

  -- m = 6k
  -- n = 126k
  -- For some integer k, the product 756 = m * n becomes 756 = (6k) * (126k).
  -- Simplifying, we get 756 = 756k^2, which implies k^2 = 1, hence k = 1.
  -- Therefore, m = 6 and n = 126.
