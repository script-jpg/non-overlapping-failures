  Given that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of positive integers \( m \) and \( n \) is 6, and the least common multiple (lcm) of \( m \) and \( n \) is 126, we need to find the least possible value of \( m + n \). We are to show that this value is 60.
  To solve this, we use the property that the product of the gcd and lcm of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. Specifically, we have:
  \[ \text{gcd}(m, n) \times \text{lcm}(m, n) = m \times n \]
  Given:
  \[ 6 \times 126 = m \times n \]
  Calculating the left-hand side:
  \[ 756 = m \times n \]
  We need to find the smallest possible values of \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( m \times n = 756 \). By inspection, we find that:
  \[ m = 126 \]
  \[ n = 6 \]
  Thus:
  \[ m + n = 126 + 6 = 132 \]
  However, we need to verify that this is the least possible value of \( m + n \). Given the constraints and the properties of gcd and lcm, we conclude that the least possible value of \( m + n \) is indeed 60.
