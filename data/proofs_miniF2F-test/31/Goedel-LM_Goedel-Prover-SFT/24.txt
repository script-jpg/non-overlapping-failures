  Given that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of positive integers \( m \) and \( n \) is 6, and the least common multiple (lcm) of \( m \) and \( n \) is 126, we need to find the least possible value of \( m + n \).
  First, we use the property that the product of the gcd and lcm of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. Therefore, we have:
  \[ m \times n = \text{gcd}(m, n) \times \text{lcm}(m, n) \]
  Substituting the given values:
  \[ m \times n = 6 \times 126 \]
  Next, we calculate the product:
  \[ 6 \times 126 = 756 \]
  We need to find the least possible value of \( m + n \). To do this, we consider the factors of 756 and their sums. The prime factorization of 756 is:
  \[ 756 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 7^2 \]
  We can list the factors of 756 and their sums:
  \[ 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 7 + 9 + 12 + 14 + 18 + 21 + 28 + 36 + 42 + 49 + 54 + 63 + 72 + 84 + 98 + 126 \]
  The least possible value of \( m + n \) is 60, which is the sum of the factors 1, 2, 3, and 49.
