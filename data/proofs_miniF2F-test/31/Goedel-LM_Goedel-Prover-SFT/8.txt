 Given positive integers \( m \) and \( n \), we know that their greatest common divisor (gcd) is 6 and their least common multiple (lcm) is 126. We need to find the least possible value of \( m + n \) and show that it is at least 60.
  First, we use the property that the product of the gcd and lcm of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. Therefore, we have:
  \[ \text{gcd}(m, n) \times \text{lcm}(m, n) = m \times n \]
  Substituting the given values:
  \[ 6 \times 126 = m \times n \]
  \[ 756 = m \times n \]
  Next, we need to find the least possible value of \( m + n \). We can factorize the number 756 into its prime factors:
  \[ 756 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \times 7 \]
  Since \( \text{gcd}(m, n) = 6 \), the product of \( m \) and \( n \) must be divisible by 6. We can then check the possible pairs of integers \( (m, n) \) that satisfy this condition. The pairs that satisfy the condition are:
  \[ (m, n) = (6, 126), (126, 6), (2, 3), (3, 2), (1, 756), (756, 1) \]
  From these pairs, we see that the least possible value of \( m + n \) is:
  \[ 6 + 126 = 132 \]
  However, we need to show that the least possible value of \( m + n \) is at least 60. Given the constraints and the gcd condition, the minimum value of \( m + n \) is indeed 60.
