  Given that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of positive integers \( m \) and \( n \) is 6, and the least common multiple (lcm) of \( m \) and \( n \) is 126, we need to determine the least possible value of \( m + n \).
  First, we use the property that the product of the gcd and lcm of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. Therefore, we have:
  \[ \text{gcd}(m, n) \times \text{lcm}(m, n) = m \times n \]
  Substituting the given values into this equation, we get:
  \[ 6 \times 126 = m \times n \]
  \[ 756 = m \times n \]
  Next, we use the fact that the gcd of \( m \) and \( n \) is 6, which implies that \( m \) and \( n \) are not coprime. We need to find the least possible value of \( m + n \). By considering the factors of 756 and their pairs that multiply to 756, we can determine the minimum sum \( m + n \).
  After analyzing the factors of 756, we find that the minimum sum of \( m \) and \( n \) that satisfies the given conditions is 60.
