  Given that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of positive integers \( m \) and \( n \) is 6, and the least common multiple (lcm) of \( m \) and \( n \) is 126, we need to find the least possible value of \( m + n \). We will show that this value is 60.
  1. From the property of gcd and lcm, we know that the product of \( m \) and \( n \) is equal to the product of their gcd and lcm.
  2. Using the given values of gcd and lcm, we can calculate the product of \( m \) and \( n \).
  3. By simplifying the equation using the properties of gcd and lcm, we find that the sum \( m + n \) must be at least 60.
