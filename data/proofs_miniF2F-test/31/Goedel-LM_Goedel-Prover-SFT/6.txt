  Given positive integers \( m \) and \( n \), we know that their greatest common divisor (gcd) is 6 and their least common multiple (lcm) is 126. We need to find the least possible value of \( m + n \).
  First, we use the relationship between the gcd and lcm of two numbers:
  \[ \text{gcd}(m, n) \times \text{lcm}(m, n) = m \times n \]
  Substituting the given values:
  \[ 6 \times 126 = m \times n \]
  \[ 756 = m \times n \]
  Next, we need to find the smallest possible values of \( m \) and \( n \) that satisfy this equation. We can factorize 756 as:
  \[ 756 = 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 7 \]
  Thus, the pairs \((m, n)\) that satisfy the equation are:
  \[ (2 \times 3, 2 \times 126) = (6, 252) \]
  \[ (2 \times 2, 2 \times 126) = (4, 252) \]
  \[ (6, 126) = (6, 126) \]
  \[ (2 \times 3, 126) = (6, 126) \]
  \[ (2 \times 2, 126) = (4, 126) \]
  \[ (6, 6) = (6, 6) \]
  From these, we see that the smallest value of \( m + n \) is \( 6 + 126 = 132 \).
