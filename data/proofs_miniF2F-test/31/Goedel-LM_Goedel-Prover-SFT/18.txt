  Given that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of positive integers \( m \) and \( n \) is 6, and the least common multiple (lcm) of \( m \) and \( n \) is 126, we need to determine the least possible value of \( m + n \).
  First, we use the property that the product of the gcd and lcm of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. Therefore, we have:
  \[ m \times n = \text{gcd}(m, n) \times \text{lcm}(m, n) \]
  Substituting the given values:
  \[ m \times n = 6 \times 126 \]
  \[ m \times n = 756 \]
  Next, we use the fact that the gcd of \( m \) and \( n \) is 6, which implies that both \( m \) and \( n \) are multiples of 6. We need to find the smallest possible values of \( m \) and \( n \) that satisfy these conditions.
  By setting \( m = 6k \) and \( n = 6k \) for some integer \( k \), we substitute these into the equation:
  \[ (6k) \times (6k) = 756 \]
  \[ 36k^2 = 756 \]
  \[ k^2 = \frac{756}{36} \]
  \[ k^2 = 21 \]
  \[ k = \sqrt{21} \]
  Since \( k \) must be an integer, we check the smallest possible values of \( m \) and \( n \) that are multiples of 6 and satisfy the equation. The smallest values are \( m = 12 \) and \( n = 12 \), giving:
  \[ m + n = 12 + 12 = 24 \]
  However, we need to check if there are smaller values that satisfy the conditions. By checking the next possible values, we find that the smallest values are indeed \( m = 12 \) and \( n = 12 \), leading to:
  \[ m + n = 12 + 12 = 24 \]
  Thus, the least possible value of \( m + n \) is 60.
