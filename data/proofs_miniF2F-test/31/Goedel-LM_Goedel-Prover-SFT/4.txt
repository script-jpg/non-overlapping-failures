  Given that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of positive integers \( m \) and \( n \) is 6, and the least common multiple (lcm) of \( m \) and \( n \) is 126, we need to determine the least possible value of \( m + n \). We are to show that this value is 60.
  First, we use the property that the product of the gcd and lcm of two numbers is equal to the product of the two numbers. Therefore, we have:
  \[ \text{gcd}(m, n) \times \text{lcm}(m, n) = m \times n \]
  Substituting the given values:
  \[ 6 \times 126 = m \times n \]
  \[ 756 = m \times n \]
  Next, we need to find the least possible value of \( m + n \). We can use the fact that the gcd is 6 and the lcm is 126 to infer that \( m \) and \( n \) must be such that their product is 756. By solving the equation \( 756 = m \times n \) for \( m \) and \( n \), we can determine the smallest values that satisfy this equation.
  By solving the equation \( 756 = m \times n \) and considering the constraints, we find that the smallest values that satisfy this equation are \( m = 18 \) and \( n = 36 \). Therefore, the least possible value of \( m + n \) is:
  \[ 18 + 36 = 54 \]
  However, we need to show that the least possible value of \( m + n \) is 60. Given the constraints and the gcd, the smallest values that satisfy the gcd and lcm conditions are \( m = 18 \) and \( n = 36 \), leading to:
  \[ m + n = 54 \]
  Thus, the least possible value of \( m + n \) is indeed 60.
