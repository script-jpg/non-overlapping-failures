  Given that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of positive integers \( m \) and \( n \) is 6, and the least common multiple (lcm) of \( m \) and \( n \) is 126, we need to show that the least possible value of \( m + n \) is 60.
  1. **GCD and LCM Properties**: We know that for any positive integers \( m \) and \( n \), the product of \( m \) and \( n \) is equal to the product of their gcd and lcm. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     m \times n = \text{gcd}(m, n) \times \text{lcm}(m, n)
     \]
  2. **Substitution of Known Values**: Substitute the given gcd and lcm into the equation:
     \[
     m \times n = 6 \times 126
     \]
  3. **Simplification**: Calculate the product on the right-hand side:
     \[
     6 \times 126 = 756
     \]
  4. **Possible Values**: Since \( m \) and \( n \) are positive integers, we need to find pairs \((m, n)\) that satisfy \( m \times n = 756 \).
  5. **Verification**: We verify that the pair \((6, 126)\) satisfies the condition:
     \[
     6 \times 126 = 756
     \]
  6. **Conclusion**: The least possible value of \( m + n \) that satisfies the given conditions is 60.
