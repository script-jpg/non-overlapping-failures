  Given that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of positive integers \( m \) and \( n \) is 6, and the least common multiple (lcm) of \( m \) and \( n \) is 126, we need to find the least possible value of \( m + n \). We will show that \( m + n \) must be at least 60.
  1. We start by using the relationship between gcd and lcm:
     \[
     \text{gcd}(m, n) \times \text{lcm}(m, n) = m \times n
     \]
     Substituting the given values:
     \[
     6 \times 126 = m \times n
     \]
     Simplifying this equation:
     \[
     756 = m \times n
     \]
  2. We need to find the least possible value of \( m + n \). To do this, we consider the possible pairs \((m, n)\) that satisfy the equation \( 756 = m \times n \).
  3. We list the pairs \((m, n)\) that satisfy the equation:
     \[
     (m, n) = (1, 756), (2, 378), (3, 252), (4, 176.25), (6, 126)
     \]
  4. We observe that the pairs \((1, 756)\), \((2, 378)\), and \((3, 252)\) do not satisfy \( m + n \geq 60 \). Therefore, we must consider the pairs \((4, 176.25)\) and \((6, 126)\).
  5. For the pair \((6, 126)\):
     \[
     6 + 126 = 132
     \]
  6. For the pair \((4, 176.25)\):
     \[
     4 + 176.25 = 180.25
     \]
  7. Since \( 126 \geq 180.25 \), the pair \((6, 126)\) is the better solution.
  8. Therefore, the least possible value of \( m + n \) is 60.
