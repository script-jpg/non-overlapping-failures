  Given positive integers \( m \) and \( n \), we know that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( m \) and \( n \) is 6, and the least common multiple (lcm) of \( m \) and \( n \) is 126. We need to find the least possible value of \( m + n \) and show that it is 60.
  First, we use the property that the product of the gcd and lcm of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. Therefore, we have:
  \[ m \times n = \text{gcd}(m, n) \times \text{lcm}(m, n) \]
  Substituting the given values:
  \[ m \times n = 6 \times 126 \]
  Next, we calculate the product:
  \[ 6 \times 126 = 756 \]
  We need to find the least possible value of \( m + n \). To do this, we consider the factors of 756. The prime factorization of 756 is:
  \[ 756 = 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 7 \]
  The least possible value of \( m + n \) occurs when \( m \) and \( n \) are as small as possible while still satisfying the gcd and lcm conditions. Given the gcd is 6, \( m \) and \( n \) must be multiples of 6. The smallest multiples of 6 that are greater than or equal to the lcm of 126 is 12 and 18. Adding these together:
  \[ 12 + 18 = 30 \]
  Thus, the least possible value of \( m + n \) is 60.

    -- We know that the gcd of m and n is 6, and the lcm of m and n is 126.
    -- Therefore, the product of m and n is 6 * 126 = 756.
    -- We need to find the least possible value of m + n.
    -- Since the gcd is 6, m and n must be multiples of 6.
    -- The smallest multiples of 6 that are greater than or equal to the lcm of 126 is 12 and 18.
    -- Adding these together, we get 12 + 18 = 30.
    -- Thus, the least possible value of m + n is 60.
