  Given that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of positive integers \( m \) and \( n \) is 6, and the least common multiple (lcm) of \( m \) and \( n \) is 126, we need to find the least possible value of \( m + n \). We are to show that this value is 60.
  First, we use the property that the product of the gcd and lcm of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. Specifically, for any two integers \( m \) and \( n \), we have:
  \[ \text{gcd}(m, n) \times \text{lcm}(m, n) = m \times n \]
  Substituting the given values into this equation, we get:
  \[ 6 \times 126 = m \times n \]
  \[ 756 = m \times n \]
  Next, we need to find the least possible value of \( m + n \). To do this, we consider the pairs of positive integers \( (m, n) \) that satisfy \( 756 = m \times n \). We will check each pair to find the smallest possible sum \( m + n \).
