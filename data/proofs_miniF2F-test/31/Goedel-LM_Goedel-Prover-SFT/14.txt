 Given that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of positive integers \( m \) and \( n \) is 6, and the least common multiple (lcm) of \( m \) and \( n \) is 126, we need to determine the least possible value of \( m + n \).
  First, we use the relationship between the gcd and lcm of two numbers \( a \) and \( b \):
  \[ \text{gcd}(a, b) \times \text{lcm}(a, b) = a \times b. \]
  Applying this to our case:
  \[ 6 \times 126 = m \times n. \]
  Next, we use the property of the gcd and lcm:
  \[ \text{gcd}(m, n) \times \text{lcm}(m, n) = m \times n. \]
  Since we know the gcd and lcm, we can substitute these values into the equation:
  \[ 6 \times 126 = m \times n. \]
  Now, we solve for \( m + n \). We know that \( m \) and \( n \) are positive integers, and we need to find the minimum value of \( m + n \).
  Given the constraints, we can use the fact that the gcd of \( m \) and \( n \) is 6, and the lcm is 126. We need to find the minimum value of \( m + n \) that satisfies these conditions.
  By solving the equation \( 6 \times 126 = m \times n \), we find that the minimum value of \( m + n \) is 60.

    -- If the sum of m and n is less than 60, then we can find a contradiction with the gcd and lcm properties.
