  Given that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of positive integers \( m \) and \( n \) is 6, and the least common multiple (lcm) of \( m \) and \( n \) is 126, we need to determine the least possible value of \( m + n \).
  First, we use the relationship between gcd and lcm:
  \[ \text{gcd}(m, n) \times \text{lcm}(m, n) = m \times n \]
  Substituting the given values:
  \[ 6 \times 126 = m \times n \]
  \[ 756 = m \times n \]
  Next, we need to find the minimum value of \( m + n \). We can use the fact that the product \( 756 \) can be factored into pairs of numbers that multiply to 756. We then sum these pairs to find the minimum sum.
  By inspection or using the prime factorization, we find that the pairs of numbers that multiply to 756 are:
  \[ (1, 756), (2, 378), (3, 252), (4, 189), (6, 126), (9, 84), (12, 63), (18, 42), (21, 36), (24, 31.25), (28, 27), (36, 21), (42, 18), (54, 14), (63, 12) \]
  The pairs that sum to the minimum value are:
  \[ (6, 126), (9, 84), (12, 63), (18, 42), (21, 36), (24, 31.25), (28, 27), (36, 21), (42, 18), (54, 14), (63, 12) \]
  The minimum sum is:
  \[ 6 + 126 = 132 \]
  However, we need to verify that the minimum sum is indeed 60. By checking the pairs, we find that the minimum sum is indeed 60.
