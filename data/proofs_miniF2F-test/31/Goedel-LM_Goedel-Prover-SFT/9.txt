  Given that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of positive integers \( m \) and \( n \) is 6, and the least common multiple (lcm) of \( m \) and \( n \) is 126, we need to find the least possible value of \( m + n \). We are to show that this value is 60.
  First, we use the property that the product of the gcd and lcm of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. Using this property, we can derive the product of \( m \) and \( n \).
  Next, we use the fact that the gcd of \( m \) and \( n \) is 6 and the lcm is 126 to find the sum of \( m \) and \( n \). By manipulating the equations, we can show that \( m + n \) must be at least 60.
