  Given \( r \) is a real number such that \( r^{\frac{1}{3}} + \frac{1}{r^{\frac{1}{3}}} = 3 \), we need to show that \( r^3 + \frac{1}{r^3} = 5778 \).
  1. Start by simplifying the given equation \( r^{\frac{1}{3}} + \frac{1}{r^{\frac{1}{3}}} = 3 \).
  2. Clear the fraction by multiplying both sides by \( r^{\frac{1}{3}} \).
  3. Simplify the resulting equation to isolate terms involving \( r \).
  4. Use algebraic manipulation to express \( r^3 + \frac{1}{r^3} \) in terms of \( r \).
  5. Substitute the known value of the expression from the given equation into the derived form.
