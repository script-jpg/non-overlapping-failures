  Given \( r \) is a real number such that \( r^{\frac{1}{3}} + \frac{1}{r^{\frac{1}{3}}} = 3 \), we need to show that \( r^3 + \frac{1}{r^3} = 5778 \).
  1. Start by simplifying the given equation \( r^{\frac{1}{3}} + \frac{1}{r^{\frac{1}{3}}} = 3 \).
  2. Normalize the expression using algebraic rules.
  3. Use the fact that \( r \neq 0 \) to clear denominators.
  4. Apply algebraic manipulations to express \( r^3 + \frac{1}{r^3} \) in terms of \( r^{\frac{1}{3}} + \frac{1}{r^{\frac{1}{3}}} \).
  5. Verify that the resulting expression equals 5778.
