  Given a real number \( r \) such that \( r^{\frac{1}{3}} + \frac{1}{r^{\frac{1}{3}}} = 3 \), we need to show that \( r^3 + \frac{1}{r^3} = 5778 \).
  First, we simplify the given equation \( r^{\frac{1}{3}} + \frac{1}{r^{\frac{1}{3}}} = 3 \) by eliminating the cube roots. We then manipulate the equation algebraically to find a relationship involving \( r^3 \) and \( r^3 \). By squaring and simplifying, we derive the desired result.
