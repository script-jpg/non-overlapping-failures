  Given a real number \( r \) such that \( r^{\frac{1}{3}} + \frac{1}{r^{\frac{1}{3}}} = 3 \), we need to show that \( r^3 + \frac{1}{r^3} = 5778 \).
  1. Start by simplifying the given equation \( r^{\frac{1}{3}} + \frac{1}{r^{\frac{1}{3}}} = 3 \).
  2. Normalize the expressions using algebraic rules.
  3. Use the given equation to derive the value of \( r^3 + \frac{1}{r^3} \) by manipulating the terms algebraically.
  4. Verify the final result using arithmetic calculations.

  -- Use the given equation to derive the value of the target expression.
  -- The given equation is: r^(1/3) + 1/r^(1/3) = 3
  -- The target expression is: r^3 + 1/r^3
  -- By algebraic manipulation, we can show that:
  -- r^3 + 1/r^3 = (r^(1/3) + 1/r^(1/3))^3 - 3 * (r^(1/3) + 1/r^(1/3))
  -- Substituting the given equation into this formula, we get:
  -- r^3 + 1/r^3 = 3^3 - 3 * 3 = 27 - 9 = 18
  -- However, we need to verify the final result using arithmetic calculations.
