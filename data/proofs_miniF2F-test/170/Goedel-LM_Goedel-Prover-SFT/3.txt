  Given a real number \( r \) such that \( r^{\frac{1}{3}} + \frac{1}{r^{\frac{1}{3}}} = 3 \), we need to show that \( r^3 + \frac{1}{r^3} = 5778 \).
  1. First, we establish that \( r \neq 0 \) to avoid division by zero.
  2. We use the given equation \( r^{\frac{1}{3}} + \frac{1}{r^{\frac{1}{3}}} = 3 \) to derive a relationship involving \( r^3 \) and \( r^3 \).
  3. We simplify the expressions using algebraic manipulations and properties of real numbers.
  4. Finally, we verify that the derived relationship matches the required result.
