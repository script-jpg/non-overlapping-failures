  Given a real number \( r \) such that \( r^{\frac{1}{3}} + \frac{1}{r^{\frac{1}{3}}} = 3 \), we need to show that \( r^3 + \frac{1}{r^3} = 5778 \).
  1. Start by simplifying the given equation \( r^{\frac{1}{3}} + \frac{1}{r^{\frac{1}{3}}} = 3 \).
  2. Normalize the expression using ring operations to prepare for further manipulation.
  3. Use algebraic identities and properties to derive the desired result.
