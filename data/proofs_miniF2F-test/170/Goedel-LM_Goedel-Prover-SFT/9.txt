  Given a real number \( r \) such that \( r^{\frac{1}{3}} + \frac{1}{r^{\frac{1}{3}}} = 3 \), we need to show that \( r^3 + \frac{1}{r^3} = 5778 \).
  First, we simplify the given equation \( r^{\frac{1}{3}} + \frac{1}{r^{\frac{1}{3}}} = 3 \). By raising both sides to the power of 3, we obtain:
  \[
  \left( r^{\frac{1}{3}} + \frac{1}{r^{\frac{1}{3}}} \right)^3 = 3^3
  \]
  Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
  \[
  r^3 + 3 \cdot r^{\frac{1}{3}} \cdot \frac{1}{r^{\frac{1}{3}}} + \frac{1}{r^3} = 27
  \]
  Simplifying, we have:
  \[
  r^3 + 3 + \frac{1}{r^3} = 27
  \]
  Subtracting 3 from both sides, we obtain:
  \[
  r^3 + \frac{1}{r^3} = 24
  \]
  However, this result does not match the expected value of 5778. Therefore, there must be an error in the algebraic manipulations or the initial assumptions.
