  Given a real number \( r \) such that \( r^{\frac{1}{3}} + \frac{1}{r^{\frac{1}{3}}} = 3 \), we need to show that \( r^3 + \frac{1}{r^3} = 5778 \).
  1. Start by expressing the given condition in a more manageable form.
  2. Use algebraic manipulation to derive the desired result.
  -/
  -- Normalize the given condition using ring operations to prepare for further manipulation.
  ring_nf at h₀
  -- Use non-linear arithmetic to solve the equation.
  nlinarith [h₀]
