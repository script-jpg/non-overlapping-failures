  Given a real number \( r \) such that \( r^{\frac{1}{3}} + \frac{1}{r^{\frac{1}{3}}} = 3 \), we need to show that \( r^3 + \frac{1}{r^3} = 5778 \).
  First, we simplify the given equation by expressing \( r^{\frac{1}{3}} \) and \( \frac{1}{r^{\frac{1}{3}}} \) in terms of \( r \). We then use algebraic manipulations to find the relationship between \( r^3 \) and \( \frac{1}{r^3} \).
