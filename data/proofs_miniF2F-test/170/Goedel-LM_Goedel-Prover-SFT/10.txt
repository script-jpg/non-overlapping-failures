  Given \( r \) is a real number such that \( r^{\frac{1}{3}} + \frac{1}{r^{\frac{1}{3}}} = 3 \), we need to show that \( r^3 + \frac{1}{r^3} = 5778 \).
  First, we express \( r \) in terms of its cube root, \( r = x \). Then, we use the given equation to find a relationship between the cube root and the reciprocal. By simplifying the given equation, we derive that \( x^3 + \frac{1}{x^3} = 5778 \).
