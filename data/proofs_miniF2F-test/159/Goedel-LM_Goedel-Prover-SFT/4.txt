  To find the units digit of \(16^{17} \times 17^{18} \times 18^{19}\), we need to determine the units digits of each term individually and then multiply these units digits. The units digit of a number is equivalent to the remainder when the number is divided by 10.
  1. **Units digit of \(16^{17}\)**:
     - The units digit of \(16\) is \(6\).
     - The units digit of \(6^n\) cycles every 4 powers: \(6^1 = 6\), \(6^2 = 36\), \(6^3 = 216\), \(6^4 = 1296\), and \(6^5 = 7776\).
     - Since \(17 \mod 4 = 1\), the units digit of \(6^{17}\) is the same as the units digit of \(6^1\), which is \(6\).
  2. **Units digit of \(17^{18}\)**:
     - The units digit of \(17\) is \(7\).
     - The units digit of \(7^n\) cycles every 4 powers: \(7^1 = 7\), \(7^2 = 49\), \(7^3 = 343\), \(7^4 = 2401\), and \(7^5 = 16807\).
     - Since \(18 \mod 4 = 2\), the units digit of \(7^{18}\) is the same as the units digit of \(7^2\), which is \(9\).
  3. **Units digit of \(18^{19}\)**:
     - The units digit of \(18\) is \(8\).
     - The units digit of \(8^n\) cycles every 4 powers: \(8^1 = 8\), \(8^2 = 64\), \(8^3 = 512\), \(8^4 = 4096\), and \(8^5 = 32768\).
     - Since \(19 \mod 4 = 3\), the units digit of \(8^{19}\) is the same as the units digit of \(8^3\), which is \(2\).
  Finally, we multiply the units digits:
  \[ 6 \times 9 \times 2 = 108 \]
  The units digit of \(108\) is \(8\).
