  To find the units digit of \(16^{17} \times 17^{18} \times 18^{19}\), we need to determine the units digit of each term separately and then combine these units digits.
  1. **Units digit of \(16^{17}\)**:
     - The units digit of \(16\) is \(6\).
     - The units digit of \(6^n\) cycles every 4 powers: \(6, 6, 6, 6, \ldots\).
     - Since \(17 \mod 4 = 1\), the units digit of \(16^{17}\) is the same as \(6^1\), which is \(6\).
  2. **Units digit of \(17^{18}\)**:
     - The units digit of \(17\) is \(7\).
     - The units digit of \(7^n\) cycles every 4 powers: \(7, 9, 3, 1, \ldots\).
     - Since \(18 \mod 4 = 2\), the units digit of \(17^{18}\) is the same as \(7^2\), which is \(9\).
  3. **Units digit of \(18^{19}\)**:
     - The units digit of \(18\) is \(8\).
     - The units digit of \(8^n\) cycles every 4 powers: \(8, 4, 2, 6, \ldots\).
     - Since \(19 \mod 4 = 3\), the units digit of \(18^{19}\) is the same as \(8^3\), which is \(2\).
  Finally, we combine the units digits:
  - The units digit of \(16^{17}\) is \(6\).
  - The units digit of \(17^{18}\) is \(9\).
  - The units digit of \(18^{19}\) is \(2\).
  - Therefore, the units digit of \(16^{17} \times 17^{18} \times 18^{19}\) is \(6 \times 9 \times 2 = 108\), which has a units digit of \(8\).
