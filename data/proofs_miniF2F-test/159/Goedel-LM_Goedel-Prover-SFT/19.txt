  To find the units digit of \(16^{17} \times 17^{18} \times 18^{19}\), we need to consider the units digits of the individual powers. The units digit of \(16\) is \(6\), the units digit of \(17\) is \(7\), and the units digit of \(18\) is \(8\). Therefore, we need to find the units digit of \(6^{17} \times 7^{18} \times 8^{19}\).
  The units digit of \(6^n\) cycles every 4 powers:
  - \(6^1 = 6\) (units digit is \(6\))
  - \(6^2 = 36\) (units digit is \(6\))
  - \(6^3 = 216\) (units digit is \(6\))
  - \(6^4 = 1296\) (units digit is \(6\))
  Thus, the units digit of \(6^n\) for any positive integer \(n\) is \(6\).
  Similarly, the units digit of \(7^n\) cycles every 4 powers:
  - \(7^1 = 7\) (units digit is \(7\))
  - \(7^2 = 49\) (units digit is \(9\))
  - \(7^3 = 343\) (units digit is \(3\))
  - \(7^4 = 2401\) (units digit is \(1\))
  Thus, the units digit of \(7^n\) for any positive integer \(n\) is:
  - \(7\) if \(n \mod 4 = 0\)
  - \(9\) if \(n \mod 4 = 1\)
  - \(3\) if \(n \mod 4 = 2\)
  - \(1\) if \(n \mod 4 = 3\)
  Since \(17 \mod 4 = 1\), the units digit of \(7^{17}\) is \(9\).
  Similarly, the units digit of \(8^n\) cycles every 4 powers:
  - \(8^1 = 8\) (units digit is \(8\))
  - \(8^2 = 64\) (units digit is \(4\))
  - \(8^3 = 512\) (units digit is \(2\))
  - \(8^4 = 4096\) (units digit is \(6\))
  Thus, the units digit of \(8^n\) for any positive integer \(n\) is:
  - \(8\) if \(n \mod 4 = 0\)
  - \(4\) if \(n \mod 4 = 1\)
  - \(2\) if \(n \mod 4 = 2\)
  - \(6\) if \(n \mod 4 = 3\)
  Since \(19 \mod 4 = 3\), the units digit of \(8^{19}\) is \(6\).
  Therefore, the units digit of \(16^{17} \times 17^{18} \times 18^{19}\) is:
  \[ 6 \times 9 \times 6 = 324 \]
  The units digit of \(324\) is \(4\).
