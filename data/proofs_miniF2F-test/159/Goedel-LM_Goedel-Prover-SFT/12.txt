  To find the units digit of \(16^{17} \times 17^{18} \times 18^{19}\), we need to determine the units digit of each term individually and then combine these units digits.
  1. **Units digit of \(16^{17}\)**:
     - The units digit of \(16\) is \(6\).
     - The units digit of \(16^n\) cycles every 4 powers: \(6, 6, 6, 6, \ldots\).
     - Since \(17 \mod 4 = 1\), the units digit of \(16^{17}\) is the same as the units digit of \(16^1\), which is \(6\).
  2. **Units digit of \(17^{18}\)**:
     - The units digit of \(17\) is \(7\).
     - The units digit of \(17^n\) cycles every 4 powers: \(7, 9, 3, 1, \ldots\).
     - Since \(18 \mod 4 = 2\), the units digit of \(17^{18}\) is the same as the units digit of \(17^2\), which is \(9\).
  3. **Units digit of \(18^{19}\)**:
     - The units digit of \(18\) is \(8\).
     - The units digit of \(18^n\) cycles every 4 powers: \(8, 4, 2, 6, \ldots\).
     - Since \(19 \mod 4 = 3\), the units digit of \(18^{19}\) is the same as the units digit of \(18^3\), which is \(2\).
  Combining these units digits:
  - \(6 \times 9 = 54\), so the units digit of \(54\) is \(4\).
  - \(4 \times 2 = 8\), so the units digit of \(8\) is \(8\).
  Thus, the units digit of \(16^{17} \times 17^{18} \times 18^{19}\) is \(8\).
