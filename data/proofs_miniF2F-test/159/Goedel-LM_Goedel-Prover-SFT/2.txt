  To find the units digit of \(16^{17} \times 17^{18} \times 18^{19}\), we need to compute the expression modulo 10. We start by noting the units digits of the numbers involved:
  - The units digit of \(16\) is \(6\).
  - The units digit of \(17\) is \(7\).
  - The units digit of \(18\) is \(8\).
  Thus, the units digits of \(16^{17}\), \(17^{18}\), and \(18^{19}\) are the same as the units digits of \(6^{17}\), \(7^{18}\), and \(8^{19}\) respectively.
  Next, we observe the pattern in the units digits of powers of \(6\), \(7\), and \(8\):
  - \(6^1 = 6\) (units digit is \(6\))
  - \(6^2 = 36\) (units digit is \(6\))
  - \(6^3 = 216\) (units digit is \(6\))
  - \(7^1 = 7\) (units digit is \(7\))
  - \(7^2 = 49\) (units digit is \(9\))
  - \(7^3 = 343\) (units digit is \(3\))
  - \(8^1 = 8\) (units digit is \(8\))
  - \(8^2 = 64\) (units digit is \(4\))
  - \(8^3 = 512\) (units digit is \(2\))
  From this pattern, we see that the units digits of powers of \(6\) and \(8\) repeat every 4 powers, and the units digit of \(7\) is \(7\) for all powers.
  Since \(17 \equiv 1 \pmod{4}\) and \(18 \equiv 2 \pmod{4}\), the units digits of \(6^{17}\) and \(8^{19}\) are the same as the units digits of \(6^1\) and \(8^1\) respectively.
  Thus, the units digits are:
  - \(6^{17}\) has a units digit of \(6\).
  - \(7^{18}\) has a units digit of \(9\).
  - \(8^{19}\) has a units digit of \(2\).
  Multiplying these together, we get:
  \[ 6 \times 9 = 54 \]
  The units digit of \(54\) is \(4\).
  Multiplying by \(2\), we get:
  \[ 4 \times 2 = 8 \]
  Thus, the units digit of \(16^{17} \times 17^{18} \times 18^{19}\) is \(8\).
