  To find the units digit of \(16^{17} \times 17^{18} \times 18^{19}\), we need to determine the units digits of each term separately and then combine them. The units digit of a number raised to a power depends only on the units digit of the base number.
  1. **Units digit of \(16^{17}\)**:
     - The units digit of \(16\) is \(6\).
     - The units digit of \(6^n\) cycles every 4 powers: \(6, 6, 6, 6, \ldots\).
     - Since \(17 \mod 4 = 1\), the units digit of \(6^{17}\) is the same as the units digit of \(6^1\), which is \(6\).
  2. **Units digit of \(17^{18}\)**:
     - The units digit of \(17\) is \(7\).
     - The units digit of \(7^n\) cycles every 4 powers: \(7, 9, 3, 1, \ldots\).
     - Since \(18 \mod 4 = 2\), the units digit of \(7^{18}\) is the same as the units digit of \(7^2\), which is \(9\).
  3. **Units digit of \(18^{19}\)**:
     - The units digit of \(18\) is \(8\).
     - The units digit of \(8^n\) cycles every 4 powers: \(8, 4, 2, 6, \ldots\).
     - Since \(19 \mod 4 = 3\), the units digit of \(8^{19}\) is the same as the units digit of \(8^3\), which is \(2\).
  Finally, we multiply the units digits of the three terms:
  \[ 6 \times 9 \times 2 = 108 \]
  The units digit of \(108\) is \(8\).

  -- The units digit of 16^17 is the same as the units digit of 6^17, which is 6.
  -- The units digit of 17^18 is the same as the units digit of 7^18, which is 9.
  -- The units digit of 18^19 is the same as the units digit of 8^19, which is 2.
  -- Multiplying these units digits: 6 * 9 * 2 = 108, whose units digit is 8.
