  To find the units digit of \(16^{17} \times 17^{18} \times 18^{19}\), we need to determine the units digits of each term individually and then combine them. The units digit of a number raised to a power depends only on the units digit of the base number.
  1. The units digit of \(16\) is \(6\).
  2. The units digit of \(17\) is \(7\).
  3. The units digit of \(18\) is \(8\).
  Next, we observe the units digits of the powers of these numbers:
  - \(6^1 = 6\) (units digit is \(6\))
  - \(6^2 = 36\) (units digit is \(6\))
  - \(6^3 = 216\) (units digit is \(6\))
  - \(6^4 = 1296\) (units digit is \(6\))
  Thus, the units digit of \(16^n\) for any positive integer \(n\) is \(6\).
  Similarly, the units digits of \(7^n\) and \(8^n\) can be determined by examining their patterns:
  - \(7^1 = 7\) (units digit is \(7\))
  - \(7^2 = 49\) (units digit is \(9\))
  - \(7^3 = 343\) (units digit is \(3\))
  - \(7^4 = 2401\) (units digit is \(1\))
  The units digits repeat every 4 powers: \(7, 9, 3, 1\).
  - \(8^1 = 8\) (units digit is \(8\))
  - \(8^2 = 64\) (units digit is \(4\))
  - \(8^3 = 512\) (units digit is \(2\))
  - \(8^4 = 4096\) (units digit is \(6\))
  The units digits repeat every 4 powers: \(8, 4, 2, 6\).
  Combining these, we find the units digit of \(16^{17} \times 17^{18} \times 18^{19}\):
  - The units digit of \(16^{17}\) is \(6\).
  - The units digit of \(17^{18}\) is \(7\) (since \(17 \equiv 7 \mod 10\)).
  - The units digit of \(18^{19}\) is \(8\).
  Multiplying these units digits together:
  \[ 6 \times 7 \times 8 = 336 \]
  The units digit of \(336\) is \(6\).
  Thus, the units digit of \(16^{17} \times 17^{18} \times 18^{19}\) is \(8\).
