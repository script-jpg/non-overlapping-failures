  To find the units digit of \(16^{17} \times 17^{18} \times 18^{19}\), we need to determine the units digit of each term separately and then combine them. The units digit of a number raised to a power depends on the units digit of the base number.
  1. **Units digit of \(16^{17}\)**:
     - The units digit of 16 is 6.
     - The units digit of \(6^n\) cycles every 2 powers: \(6^1 = 6\) and \(6^2 = 36\) (units digit 6).
     - Since 17 is odd, the units digit of \(6^{17}\) is 6.
  2. **Units digit of \(17^{18}\)**:
     - The units digit of 17 is 7.
     - The units digit of \(7^n\) cycles every 4 powers: \(7^1 = 7\), \(7^2 = 49\) (units digit 9), \(7^3 = 343\) (units digit 3), and \(7^4 = 2401\) (units digit 1).
     - Since 18 is even, the units digit of \(7^{18}\) is 1.
  3. **Units digit of \(18^{19}\)**:
     - The units digit of 18 is 8.
     - The units digit of \(8^n\) cycles every 4 powers: \(8^1 = 8\), \(8^2 = 64\) (units digit 4), \(8^3 = 512\) (units digit 2), and \(8^4 = 4096\) (units digit 6).
     - Since 19 is odd, the units digit of \(8^{19}\) is 8.
  Combining the units digits:
  - \(6 \times 1 = 6\) (units digit 6)
  - \(6 \times 8 = 48\) (units digit 8)
  Thus, the units digit of \(16^{17} \times 17^{18} \times 18^{19}\) is 8.
