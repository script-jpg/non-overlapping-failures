  To find the units digit of \(16^{17} \times 17^{18} \times 18^{19}\), we need to determine the units digit of each base raised to its respective power and then multiply these units digits.
  1. **Units digit of \(16^{17}\):**
     - The units digit of \(16\) is \(6\).
     - The units digit of \(16^n\) cycles every 4 powers: \(6, 6, 6, 6, \ldots\).
     - Since \(17 \mod 4 = 1\), the units digit of \(16^{17}\) is \(6\).
  2. **Units digit of \(17^{18}\):**
     - The units digit of \(17\) is \(7\).
     - The units digit of \(17^n\) cycles every 4 powers: \(7, 9, 3, 1, \ldots\).
     - Since \(18 \mod 4 = 2\), the units digit of \(17^{18}\) is \(9\).
  3. **Units digit of \(18^{19}\):**
     - The units digit of \(18\) is \(8\).
     - The units digit of \(18^n\) cycles every 4 powers: \(8, 4, 2, 6, \ldots\).
     - Since \(19 \mod 4 = 3\), the units digit of \(18^{19}\) is \(2\).
  Finally, we multiply the units digits: \(6 \times 9 \times 2 = 108\). The units digit of \(108\) is \(8\).
