  To find the units digit of \(16^{17} \times 17^{18} \times 18^{19}\), we need to determine the units digit of each term individually and then multiply these units digits. The units digit of a number is the remainder when the number is divided by 10.
  1. **Units digit of \(16^{17}\)**:
     - The units digit of \(16\) is \(6\).
     - We need to find the units digit of \(6^{17}\).
     - The units digits of powers of \(6\) cycle every 2: \(6^1 = 6\) (units digit \(6\)), \(6^2 = 36\) (units digit \(6\)), \(6^3 = 216\) (units digit \(6\)), and so on.
     - Since \(17\) is odd, \(6^{17}\) has the same units digit as \(6^1\), which is \(6\).
  2. **Units digit of \(17^{18}\)**:
     - The units digit of \(17\) is \(7\).
     - We need to find the units digit of \(7^{18}\).
     - The units digits of powers of \(7\) cycle every 4: \(7^1 = 7\) (units digit \(7\)), \(7^2 = 49\) (units digit \(9\)), \(7^3 = 343\) (units digit \(3\)), \(7^4 = 2401\) (units digit \(1\)), and so on.
     - Since \(18 \mod 4 = 2\), \(7^{18}\) has the same units digit as \(7^2\), which is \(9\).
  3. **Units digit of \(18^{19}\)**:
     - The units digit of \(18\) is \(8\).
     - We need to find the units digit of \(8^{19}\).
     - The units digits of powers of \(8\) cycle every 4: \(8^1 = 8\) (units digit \(8\)), \(8^2 = 64\) (units digit \(4\)), \(8^3 = 512\) (units digit \(2\)), \(8^4 = 4096\) (units digit \(6\)), and so on.
     - Since \(19 \mod 4 = 3\), \(8^{19}\) has the same units digit as \(8^3\), which is \(2\).
  Finally, we multiply the units digits: \(6 \times 9 \times 2 = 108\). The units digit of \(108\) is \(8\).
