  To find the units digit of \(16^{17} \times 17^{18} \times 18^{19}\), we need to determine the last digit of the expression. We start by examining the units digits of the individual powers:
  1. The units digit of \(16\) is \(6\). Therefore, the units digit of \(16^{17}\) is the same as the units digit of \(6^{17}\).
  2. The units digit of \(17\) is \(7\). Therefore, the units digit of \(17^{18}\) is the same as the units digit of \(7^{18}\).
  3. The units digit of \(18\) is \(8\). Therefore, the units digit of \(18^{19}\) is the same as the units digit of \(8^{19}\).
  Next, we observe the pattern in the units digits of powers of \(6\), \(7\), and \(8\):
  - The units digit of \(6^n\) cycles every 4 powers: \(6, 6, 6, 6, \ldots\).
  - The units digit of \(7^n\) cycles every 4 powers: \(7, 9, 3, 1, \ldots\).
  - The units digit of \(8^n\) cycles every 4 powers: \(8, 4, 2, 6, \ldots\).
  Given these cycles:
  - \(6^{17}\) has the same units digit as \(6^1\) (since \(17 \mod 4 = 1\)).
  - \(7^{18}\) has the same units digit as \(7^2\) (since \(18 \mod 4 = 2\)).
  - \(8^{19}\) has the same units digit as \(8^3\) (since \(19 \mod 4 = 3\)).
  Thus, the units digits are:
  - \(6^1 = 6\)
  - \(7^2 = 49\) (units digit \(9\))
  - \(8^3 = 512\) (units digit \(2\))
  Multiplying these units digits:
  \[ 6 \times 9 \times 2 = 108 \]
  The units digit of \(108\) is \(8\).
  Therefore, the units digit of \(16^{17} \times 17^{18} \times 18^{19}\) is \(8\).
