  To find the units digit of \(16^{17} \times 17^{18} \times 18^{19}\), we need to determine the units digit of each term separately and then combine them.
  1. **Units digit of \(16^{17}\)**:
     - The units digit of 16 is 6.
     - The units digit of \(6^n\) cycles every 4 powers: \(6, 6, 6, 6, \ldots\).
     - Since 17 modulo 4 is 1, the units digit of \(16^{17}\) is the same as the units digit of \(6^1\), which is 6.
  2. **Units digit of \(17^{18}\)**:
     - The units digit of 17 is 7.
     - The units digit of \(7^n\) cycles every 4 powers: \(7, 9, 3, 1, \ldots\).
     - Since 18 modulo 4 is 2, the units digit of \(17^{18}\) is the same as the units digit of \(7^2\), which is 9.
  3. **Units digit of \(18^{19}\)**:
     - The units digit of 18 is 8.
     - The units digit of \(8^n\) cycles every 4 powers: \(8, 4, 2, 6, \ldots\).
     - Since 19 modulo 4 is 3, the units digit of \(18^{19}\) is the same as the units digit of \(8^3\), which is 2.
  Finally, we multiply the units digits: \(6 \times 9 \times 2 = 108\). The units digit of 108 is 8.
