  To find the units digit of \(16^{17} \times 17^{18} \times 18^{19}\), we need to determine the units digits of each term individually and then combine them. The units digit of a number is equivalent to the remainder when the number is divided by 10.
  1. **Units digit of \(16^{17}\)**:
     - The units digits of powers of 16 cycle every 2: \(16^1 = 16\) (units digit is 6), \(16^2 = 256\) (units digit is 6).
     - Since 17 is odd, \(16^{17}\) has the same units digit as \(16^1\), which is 6.
  2. **Units digit of \(17^{18}\)**:
     - The units digits of powers of 17 cycle every 4: \(17^1 = 17\) (units digit is 7), \(17^2 = 289\) (units digit is 9), \(17^3 = 4913\) (units digit is 3), \(17^4 = 83577\) (units digit is 7).
     - Since 18 is even, \(17^{18}\) has the same units digit as \(17^4\), which is 7.
  3. **Units digit of \(18^{19}\)**:
     - The units digits of powers of 18 cycle every 4: \(18^1 = 18\) (units digit is 8), \(18^2 = 324\) (units digit is 4), \(18^3 = 5832\) (units digit is 2), \(18^4 = 104856\) (units digit is 6).
     - Since 19 is odd, \(18^{19}\) has the same units digit as \(18^1\), which is 8.
  Combining the units digits:
  - \(16^{17} \times 17^{18} \times 18^{19}\) has the units digit of \(6 \times 7 \times 8\).
  - Calculate \(6 \times 7 = 42\), so the units digit is 2.
  - Calculate \(2 \times 8 = 16\), so the units digit is 6.
  Thus, the units digit of \(16^{17} \times 17^{18} \times 18^{19}\) is 8.
