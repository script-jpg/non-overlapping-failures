  To find the units digit of \(16^{17} \times 17^{18} \times 18^{19}\), we need to compute the product modulo 10. We observe the pattern in the units digits of the powers of 16, 17, and 18.
  1. **Units digit of \(16^{17}\)**:
     - The units digit of \(16\) is \(6\).
     - The units digit of \(16^2\) is \(6 \times 6 = 36\), so the units digit is \(6\).
     - The units digit of \(16^3\) is \(6 \times 6 = 36\), so the units digit is \(6\).
     - The units digit of \(16^4\) is \(6 \times 6 = 36\), so the units digit is \(6\).
     - This pattern repeats every 2 powers: \(6, 6, 6, \ldots\).
     - Since \(17 \mod 2 = 1\), the units digit of \(16^{17}\) is \(6\).
  2. **Units digit of \(17^{18}\)**:
     - The units digit of \(17\) is \(7\).
     - The units digit of \(17^2\) is \(7 \times 7 = 49\), so the units digit is \(9\).
     - The units digit of \(17^3\) is \(7 \times 9 = 63\), so the units digit is \(3\).
     - The units digit of \(17^4\) is \(7 \times 3 = 21\), so the units digit is \(1\).
     - The units digit of \(17^5\) is \(7 \times 1 = 7\), so the units digit is \(7\).
     - This pattern repeats every 4 powers: \(7, 9, 3, 1, \ldots\).
     - Since \(18 \mod 4 = 2\), the units digit of \(17^{18}\) is \(9\).
  3. **Units digit of \(18^{19}\)**:
     - The units digit of \(18\) is \(8\).
     - The units digit of \(18^2\) is \(8 \times 8 = 64\), so the units digit is \(4\).
     - The units digit of \(18^3\) is \(8 \times 4 = 32\), so the units digit is \(2\).
     - The units digit of \(18^4\) is \(8 \times 2 = 16\), so the units digit is \(6\).
     - The units digit of \(18^5\) is \(8 \times 6 = 48\), so the units digit is \(8\).
     - This pattern repeats every 4 powers: \(8, 4, 2, 6, \ldots\).
     - Since \(19 \mod 4 = 3\), the units digit of \(18^{19}\) is \(2\).
  Finally, we multiply the units digits: \(6 \times 9 \times 2 = 108\), so the units digit is \(8\).

  -- Simplify the expression modulo 10 using the properties of powers and units digits.
  simp [pow_mod, (by decide : 10 = 10), (by decide : 20 = 10 * 2)]
  -- The units digit of 16^17 is 6 (since 17 % 2 = 1).
  -- The units digit of 17^18 is 9 (since 18 % 4 = 2).
  -- The units digit of 18^19 is 2 (since 19 % 4 = 3).
  -- Multiplying these units digits: 6 * 9 * 2 = 108, so the units digit is 8.
