  To find the units digit of \(16^{17} \times 17^{18} \times 18^{19}\), we need to determine the units digit of each term separately and then combine them.
  1. **Units digit of \(16^{17}\)**:
     - The units digit of \(16\) is \(6\).
     - The units digit of \(16^n\) cycles every 2 powers: \(6^1 = 6\) and \(6^2 = 36\) (units digit \(6\)).
     - Since \(17\) is odd, \(16^{17}\) has the same units digit as \(16^1\), which is \(6\).
  2. **Units digit of \(17^{18}\)**:
     - The units digit of \(17\) is \(7\).
     - The units digit of \(17^n\) cycles every 4 powers: \(7^1 = 7\), \(7^2 = 49\) (units digit \(9\)), \(7^3 = 343\) (units digit \(3\)), \(7^4 = 2401\) (units digit \(1\)).
     - Since \(18 \mod 4 = 2\), \(17^{18}\) has the same units digit as \(17^2\), which is \(9\).
  3. **Units digit of \(18^{19}\)**:
     - The units digit of \(18\) is \(8\).
     - The units digit of \(18^n\) cycles every 2 powers: \(8^1 = 8\) and \(8^2 = 64\) (units digit \(4\)).
     - Since \(19\) is odd, \(18^{19}\) has the same units digit as \(18^1\), which is \(8\).
  Combining the units digits:
  - \(6 \times 9 = 54\), so the units digit of \(54\) is \(4\).
  - \(4 \times 8 = 32\), so the units digit of \(32\) is \(2\).
  Thus, the units digit of \(16^{17} \times 17^{18} \times 18^{19}\) is \(8\).
