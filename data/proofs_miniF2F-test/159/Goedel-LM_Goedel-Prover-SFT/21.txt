  To find the units digit of \(16^{17} \times 17^{18} \times 18^{19}\), we need to compute the expression modulo 10. We observe that the units digit of a number raised to a power depends only on the units digit of the base number.
  1. **Units digit of \(16^{17}\)**:
     - The units digit of 16 is 6.
     - The units digit of \(6^n\) cycles every 4 powers: \(6, 6, 6, 6, \ldots\).
     - Since 17 modulo 4 is 1, the units digit of \(6^{17}\) is the same as the units digit of \(6^1\), which is 6.
  2. **Units digit of \(17^{18}\)**:
     - The units digit of 17 is 7.
     - The units digit of \(7^n\) cycles every 4 powers: \(7, 9, 3, 1, \ldots\).
     - Since 18 modulo 4 is 2, the units digit of \(7^{18}\) is the same as the units digit of \(7^2\), which is 9.
  3. **Units digit of \(18^{19}\)**:
     - The units digit of 18 is 8.
     - The units digit of \(8^n\) cycles every 4 powers: \(8, 4, 2, 6, \ldots\).
     - Since 19 modulo 4 is 3, the units digit of \(8^{19}\) is the same as the units digit of \(8^3\), which is 2.
  Finally, we multiply the units digits:
  \[ 6 \times 9 \times 2 = 108 \]
  The units digit of 108 is 8.

  -- The units digit of 16^17 is 6 (since 17 % 4 = 1 and 6^1 % 10 = 6).
  -- The units digit of 17^18 is 9 (since 18 % 4 = 2 and 7^2 % 10 = 9).
  -- The units digit of 18^19 is 2 (since 19 % 4 = 3 and 8^3 % 10 = 2).
  -- Multiplying these units digits: 6 * 9 * 2 = 108, and the units digit of 108 is 8.
