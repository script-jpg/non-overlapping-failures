-- The units digit of a product is the product of the units digits.
  -- So it is equivalent to finding the units digit of $6^{17} \times 7^{18} \times 8^{19}$. There are two ways to solve it.
  simp
  -- The units digit of $6^{17}$ is 6.
  rw[show 6 ^ 17 % 10 = 6 by rfl]
  -- The units digit of $7^{18}$ is 1.
  rw[show 7 ^ 18 % 10 = 1 by rfl]
  -- The units digit of $8^{19}$ is 8.
  rw[show 8 ^ 19 % 10 = 8 by rfl]
  -- So the units digit of the product is $6 \times 1 \times 8 \bmod 10 = 48 \bmod 10 = 8$.
