-- We need to find the units digit of $16^{17} \times 17^{18} \times 18^{19}$, which is equivalent to finding the value of $16^{17} \times 17^{18} \times 18^{19} \bmod 10$.

  have h1:

    16 ^ 17 % 10 = 6 := by

      -- The pattern for the units digit of powers of 16 is as follows:

      -- $16^1 = 16$ (units digit 6)

      -- $16^2 = 256$ (units digit 6)

      -- $16^3 = 4096$ (units digit 6)

      --...

      -- In fact, for any positive integer $n$, the units digit of $16^n$ is 6.

      -- This is because 16 ≡ 6 (mod 10), and 6^n ≡ 6 (mod 10) for any positive integer n.

      -- So we have 16^17 ≡ 6 (mod 10).

    -- Now, combine the three results:

  -- The units digit of the product $16^{17} \times 17^{18} \times 18^{19}$ is determined by multiplying the units digits of each factor:

  -- 6 (from $16^{17}$) × 3 (from $17^{18}$) × 8 (from $18^{19}$) = 6 × 3 × 8 = 18 × 8 = 144

  -- The units digit of 144 is 4, but we need to compute the result modulo 10:

  -- 144 ≡ 4 (mod 10)

  -- However, let's recompute more carefully:

  -- 6 × 3 = 18 ≡ 8 (mod 10)

  -- 8 × 8 = 64 ≡ 4 (mod 10)

  -- Actually, the calculation should be:

  -- (6 × 3 × 8) ≡ (6 × 3) × 8 ≡ 18 × 8 ≡ 8 × 8 ≡ 64 ≡ 4 (mod 10)

  -- Wait, let's do this again:

  -- (6 × 3 × 8) ≡ (6 × 3) × 8 ≡ 18 × 8 ≡ 8 × 8 ≡ 64 ≡ 4 (mod 10)

  -- No, wait:

  -- 6 × 3 = 18

  -- 18 × 8 = 144

  -- 144 ≡ 4 (mod 10)

  -- But let's compute directly:

  -- (16^17 × 17^18 × 18^19) ≡ (6 × 3 × 8) ≡ 144 ≡ 4 (mod 10)

  -- This contradicts our goal, so let's compute directly using modular arithmetic properties:

  -- (16^17 × 17^18 × 18^19) ≡ (6^17 × 7^18 × 8^19) ≡ (6 × 7^2 × 8) ≡ (6 × 9 × 8) ≡ (54 × 8) ≡ (54 × 8) ≡ 432 ≡ 2 (mod 10)

  -- It seems I made an error in modular reduction at each step. Let's compute directly using the properties of modular arithmetic:

  -- (16^17 × 17^18 × 18^19) ≡ (6^17 × 7^18 × 8^19) (mod 10)

  -- We can compute each power modulo 10 separately:

  -- 6^17 ≡ 6 (mod 10) (since 6^n ≡ 6 (mod 10) for any positive integer n)

  -- 7^18 ≡ 9 (mod 10) (Cycle: 7, 9, 3, 1; 18 = 4*4 + 2, so same as 7^2 ≡ 9 (mod 10))

  -- 8^19 ≡ 8 (mod 10) (Cycle: 8, 4, 2, 6; 19 = 4*4 + 3, so same as 8^3 ≡ 2 (mod 10)) - no, wait:

  -- 8^19 ≡ 8 (mod 10) (Cycle: 8, 4, 2, 6; 19 = 4*4 + 3, so same as 8^3 ≡ 2 (mod 10))

  -- So we have: 6 × 9 × 2 = 108 ≡ 8 (mod 10)

  -- Thus the units digit is 8.
