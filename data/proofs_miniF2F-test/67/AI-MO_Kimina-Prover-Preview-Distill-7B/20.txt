-- We have a system of two equations with two variables.
  --
  -- s = 9 - 2t
  -- t = 3s + 1
  --
  -- We can solve this system algebraically.
  have h₂ : t = 3 * (9 - 2 * t) + 1 := by rw [←h₀, h₁]
  have h₃ : t = 4 := by linarith

  -- Now that we have t = 4, we can substitute it into the first equation to solve for s.
  have h₄ : s = 9 - 2 * (4 : ℝ) := by rw [←h₀, h₃]
  have h₅ : s = 1 := by linarith

  -- Thus, the point of intersection is (1, 4).
  exact ⟨h₅, h₄⟩
