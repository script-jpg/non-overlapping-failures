  -- The first equation tells us that $s = 9 - 2t$, so plugging this into the second equation gives us $t = 3(9-2t) + 1 = 27 - 6t + 1 = 28 - 6t$.

  -- We can then rearrange to get $t + 6t = 28$, or $7t = 28$, which means $t = 4$.

  -- This gives us $t = 4$, which we can plug into the first equation to get $s = 9 - 2(4) = 9 - 8 = 1$.
