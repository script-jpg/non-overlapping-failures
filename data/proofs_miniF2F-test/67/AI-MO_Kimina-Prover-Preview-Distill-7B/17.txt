-- solve by substituting $t=3s+1$ into $s=9-2t$ to get $s=9-2(3s+1)=3-6s$. then we have $s+6s=3$ so $s=1$. substitute it back to get $t=3(1)+1=4$.

This proof is quite straightforward. We have two equations:
1. $s = 9 - 2t$
2. $t = 3s + 1$

The approach is to substitute the expression for $t$ from the second equation into the first equation. This gives us:
$s = 9 - 2(3s + 1)$
$s = 9 - 6s - 2$
$s = 7 - 6s$

Adding $6s$ to both sides:
$s + 6s = 7$
$7s = 7$
$s = 1$

Now that we have $s = 1$, we can substitute it back into the second equation to find $t$:
$t = 3(1) + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4$

So the point of intersection is $(1, 4)$.

The Lean proof uses the `linarith` tactic, which is powerful for solving linear arithmetic problems. It automatically handles the substitution and solving process. The `<;>` combinator applies the tactic on the right to all goals generated by the tactic on the left. In this case, it applies `linarith` to both goals produced by the `refine'` tactic, which is setting up the conjunction of two equalities.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{(1, 4)}$.
