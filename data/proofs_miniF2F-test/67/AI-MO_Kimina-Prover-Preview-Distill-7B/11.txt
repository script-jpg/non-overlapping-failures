-- The equations of the lines are $s=9-2t$ and $t=3s+1$.
  -- Substituting the second equation into the first, we get $9-2t = 1 + 3t$.
  have : 9 - 2 * t = 1 + 3 * t := by rw [← h₀, ← h₁]
  -- This simplifies to $9-2t = 1 + 3t$.
  have : 9 - 2 * t = 1 + 3 * t := by assumption
  -- Solving for $t$, we get $t = \frac{9-1}{3+2} = \frac{8}{5} = 1.6$.
  have ht : t = 8 / 5 := by linarith
  -- Substituting this value of $t$ into the equation $s=9-2t$,  we get $s = 9 - 2 \times \frac{8}{5} = \frac{45-16}{5} = \frac{29}{5} = 5.8$.
  have : s = 29 / 5 := by linarith [h₀, ht]
  -- This contradicts the expected answer of (1,4).
  -- It seems like there is a mistake in my calculations.
  -- Let me re-think this.
  -- Substituting $t = 3s + 1$ into $s = 9 - 2t$, we get $s = 9 - 2(3s + 1) = 9 - 6s - 2 = 7 - 6s$.
  have : s = 7 - 6 * s := by linarith [h₀, h₁]
  -- Solving for $s$, we get $7s = 7$, which gives $s = 1$.
  have hs : s = 1 := by linarith
  -- Substituting this into $t = 3s + 1$, we get $t = 3(1) + 1 = 4$.
  have ht : t = 4 := by linarith [h₁, hs]
  -- So the point of intersection is indeed (1, 4).
