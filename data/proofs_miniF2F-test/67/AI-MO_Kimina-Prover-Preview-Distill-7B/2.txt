  -- The lines intersect when $s=9-2t$ and $t=3s+1$.

  -- We substitute $t=3s+1$ into $s=9-2t$ to get $s = 9 - 2(3s+1) = 9 - 6s - 2 = 7 - 6s$.

  -- So $s = 7 - 6s$. We can rearrange to get $s + 6s = 7$, so $7s = 7$ and $s=1$.

  · -- We substitute $t=3s+1$ into $s=9-2t$ to get $s = 9 - 2(3s+1) = 9 - 6s - 2 = 7 - 6s$.

    have h₂ : s = 7 - 6 * s := by linarith only [h₀, h₁]

    -- So $s = 7 - 6s$. We can rearrange to get $s + 6s = 7$, so $7s = 7$ and $s=1$.

    have h₃ : 7 * s = 7 := by linarith only [h₂]

    -- So $s = 1$.

    linarith only [h₃]

  -- Substituting $s=1$ into $t=3s+1$ to get $t=3(1)+1=4$.

  · -- Substituting $s=1$ into $t=3s+1$ to get $t=3(1)+1=4$.
