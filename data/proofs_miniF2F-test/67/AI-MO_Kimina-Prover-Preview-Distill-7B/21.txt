-- We have two equations of lines: $s = 9 - 2t$ and $t = 3s + 1$. To find the intersection point, we need to solve this system of equations.

  -- First, let's understand the approach. We have two equations with two unknowns (s and t). We need to solve for both variables.

  -- A straightforward method is to substitute the expression for one variable from one equation into the other equation. For instance, from the first equation, we have $s = 9 - 2t$. We can substitute this into the second equation $t = 3s + 1$ to get $t = 3(9 - 2t) + 1$.

  -- Let's solve this algebraically:
  -- $t = 3(9 - 2t) + 1$
  -- $t = 27 - 6t + 1$
  -- $t = 28 - 6t$
  -- $t + 6t = 28$
  -- $7t = 28$
  -- $t = 4$

  -- Now that we have $t = 4$, we can substitute back into the first equation to find $s$:
  -- $s = 9 - 2(4)$
  -- $s = 9 - 8$
  -- $s = 1$

  -- Thus, the intersection point is $(s, t) = (1, 4)$.

  -- Let's implement this in Lean 4:

  have h₂ : s = 1 := by
    linarith [h₀, h₁]

  have h₃ : t = 4 := by
    linarith [h₀, h₁]

  exact ⟨h₂, h₃⟩

  /-
  The Lean proof is remarkably concise because Lean's `linarith` tactic is powerful enough to solve systems of linear arithmetic goals automatically. When given the two equations as hypotheses, `linarith` can derive that $s = 1$ and $t = 4$ directly.

  In more detail, when Lean processes the goal, it has the two equations:
  - $s = 9 - 2t$ (h₀)
  - $t = 3s + 1$ (h₁)

  To find the value of $s$, Lean can substitute the expression for $s$ from the first equation into the second equation:
  $t = 3(9 - 2t) + 1$

  Expanding this:
  $t = 27 - 6t + 1$
  $t = 28 - 6t$
  $t + 6t = 28$
  $7t = 28$
  $t = 4$

  Then, substituting $t = 4$ back into the first equation:
  $s = 9 - 2(4)$
  $s = 9 - 8$
  $s = 1$

  Lean's `linarith` tactic is able to perform these algebraic manipulations automatically. It understands that the conjunction of the two equations implies both $s = 1$ and $t = 4$.

  The Lean proof demonstrates how powerful automation can be for solving systems of linear equations. While we would typically show the algebraic steps explicitly in a manual proof, Lean's automation can derive the result directly from the given equations.
