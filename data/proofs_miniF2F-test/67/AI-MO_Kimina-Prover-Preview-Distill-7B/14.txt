  -- The lines intersect when $s=9-2t$ and $t=3s+1$. Substituting $t=3s+1$ into $s=9-2t$ gives $s = 9 - 2(3s + 1) = 9 - 6s - 2 = 7 - 6s$. Adding $6s$ to both sides gives $7s = 7$, so $s=1$. Substituting $s=1$ into $t=3s+1$ gives $t = 3(1) + 1 = 4$.

  -- This shows that the lines intersect at the point (1,4).

  · -- Substitute $t = 3s + 1$ (equation h₁) into $s = 9 - 2t$ (equation h₀).

    -- Simplify the equation to get $s = 9 - 2(3s + 1) = 9 - 6s - 2 = 7 - 6s$.

    have h₂ : s = 7 - 6 * s := by linarith

    -- Add $6s$ to both sides to get $7s = 7$.

    have h₃ : 7 * s = 7 := by linarith

    -- Divide both sides by 7 to get $s = 1$.

    have h₄ : s = 1 := by linarith

  -- Substitute $s = 1$ (which we just proved) into $t = 3s + 1$ (equation h₁).
