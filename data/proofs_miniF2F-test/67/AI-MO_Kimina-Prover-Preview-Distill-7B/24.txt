-- We have two equations of lines:
  -- $s = 9 - 2t$ and $t = 3s + 1$.
  -- We need to find the point of intersection as an ordered pair $(s, t)$.

  -- The first step is to substitute one equation into the other.
  rw [h₀] at h₁
  -- After substitution, we get:
  -- $t = 3(9 - 2t) + 1$
  -- $t = 27 - 6t + 1$
  -- $t = 28 - 6t$
  -- $7t = 28$
  -- $t = 4$
  have ht : t = 4 := by linarith

  -- With $t = 4$ found, we substitute back into the first equation to find $s$:
  -- $s = 9 - 2(4)$
  -- $s = 9 - 8$
  -- $s = 1$
  have hs : s = 1 := by linarith [h₀, ht]

  -- Thus, the point of intersection is $(1, 4)$, which is our final answer.
  exact ⟨hs, ht⟩
