# Finding the Intersection of Two Lines in the $s-t$ Plane

I'll solve the system of equations to find where the lines $s = 9 - 2t$ and $t = 3s + 1$ intersect.

First, I'll substitute the expression for $t$ from the second equation into the first equation:

$s = 9 - 2(3s + 1)$

Expanding this gives:

$s = 9 - 6s - 2$

$s = 7 - 6s$

Adding $6s$ to both sides:

$7s = 7$

So $s = 1$.

Now, substituting $s = 1$ into the second equation $t = 3s + 1$:

$t = 3(1) + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4$

Therefore, the lines intersect at the point $(s, t) = (1, 4)$.

Let's formalize this in Lean 4:

```tactics

import Aesop

```

We begin by importing the necessary libraries and setting up the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_44 (s t : ℝ) (h₀ : s = 9 - 2 * t) (h₁ : t = 3 * s + 1) : s = 1 ∧ t = 4 := by
```

Now I'll solve the system of equations. First, substitute the expression for $t$ from the second equation into the first equation:

```tactics
have h₂ : s = 1 := by
  rw [h₁] at h₀
  linarith
```

So we've found that $s = 1$. Now, substituting this value back into the second equation to find $t$:

```tactics
have h₃ : t = 4 := by
  rw [h₂] at h₁
  linarith
```

Therefore, the point of intersection is $(1, 4)$. We can combine our results to conclude:

```tactics
exact ⟨h₂, h₃⟩
```

This confirms that the lines intersect at the point $(1, 4)$.
