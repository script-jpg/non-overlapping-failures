  have h₂ : t = 3 * (9 - 2 * t) + 1 := by rw [leftmost h₀] at h₁; exact h₁

  -- Now solve for $t$.

  have h₃ : t = 4 := by linarith

  -- Now that we know $t=4$, plug it back into the first equation to solve for $s$.

  have h₄ : s = 9 - 2 * 4 := by rw [h₃] at h₀; exact h₀

  -- Solve for $s$.

  have h₅ : s = 1 := by linarith

  -- Thus, the point of intersection is (1,4).

  exact ⟨h₅, h₄⟩  --_rewrite h₅, h₄ as h₅: s = 1, h₄: t = 1 * 4 (which is equivalent to t = 4)⟩
