The `linarith` tactic is powerful for solving linear arithmetic problems. It automatically solves the system of equations by substituting the value of one variable from one equation into the other equation. In this case, it would substitute the expression for $s$ from the first equation into the second equation, and then solve for $t$. After finding the value of $t$, it would substitute back to find $s$. This confirms that the intersection point of the two lines is indeed $(1, 4)$.

The formal proof demonstrates the solution to the system of equations:
1. $s = 9 - 2t$
2. $t = 3s + 1$

After substitution and solving, we find $s = 1$ and $t = 4$, which means the lines intersect at the point $(1, 4)$.
