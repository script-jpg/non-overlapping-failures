-- The equations are:
  --   s = 9 - 2t
  --   t = 3s + 1
  -- Substituting the first into the second:
  --   t = 3(9 - 2t) + 1
  --   t = 27 - 6t + 1
  --   t = 28 - 6t
  --   7t = 28
  --   t = 4
  have h₃ : t = 4 := by linarith [h₀, h₁]
  -- Then from the first equation:
  --   s = 9 - 2(4) = 9 - 8 = 1
  have h₂ : s = 1 := by linarith [h₀, h₁]
  -- So the point of intersection is (1, 4)
  exact ⟨h₂, h₃⟩
