  To find the point where the lines \( s = 9 - 2t \) and \( t = 3s + 1 \) intersect, we need to solve the system of equations:
  1. \( s = 9 - 2t \)
  2. \( t = 3s + 1 \)
  First, substitute \( t = 3s + 1 \) into the first equation:
  \[ s = 9 - 2(3s + 1) \]
  Simplify the equation:
  \[ s = 9 - 6s - 2 \]
  Combine like terms:
  \[ s + 6s = 9 - 2 \]
  \[ 7s = 7 \]
  Solve for \( s \):
  \[ s = 1 \]
  Next, substitute \( s = 1 \) back into the second equation to find \( t \):
  \[ t = 3(1) + 1 \]
  \[ t = 4 \]
  Thus, the point of intersection is \( (1, 4) \).

  -- Use the given equations to solve for s and t.
  -- Substitute t = 3s + 1 into s = 9 - 2t and solve for s.

  -- After simplifying, we find that s = 1.
  -- Substitute s = 1 back into t = 3s + 1 to find t.
  -- This gives t = 4.
  -- Thus, the solution is (1, 4).
