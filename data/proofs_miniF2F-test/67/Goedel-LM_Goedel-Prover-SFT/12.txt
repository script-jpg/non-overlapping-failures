  To find the point of intersection of the lines \( s = 9 - 2t \) and \( t = 3s + 1 \), we need to solve these equations simultaneously. We start by substituting \( t = 3s + 1 \) into the first equation. This gives us:
  \[ s = 9 - 2(3s + 1) \]
  Simplifying this equation:
  \[ s = 9 - 6s - 2 \]
  \[ s + 6s = 9 - 2 \]
  \[ 7s = 7 \]
  \[ s = 1 \]
  Next, we substitute \( s = 1 \) back into the equation \( t = 3s + 1 \):
  \[ t = 3(1) + 1 \]
  \[ t = 4 \]
  Thus, the point of intersection is \( (s, t) = (1, 4) \).

  -- Now that we have s = 1, we substitute this back into t = 3s + 1 to find t.
  have h₁ : t = 4 := by

  -- We construct the final answer using the values of s and t.
