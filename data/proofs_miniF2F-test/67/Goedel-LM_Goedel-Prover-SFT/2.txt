  To find the point where the lines \( s = 9 - 2t \) and \( t = 3s + 1 \) intersect, we solve the system of equations:
  1. \( s = 9 - 2t \)
  2. \( t = 3s + 1 \)
  First, substitute \( s \) from the first equation into the second equation:
  \[ t = 3(9 - 2t) + 1 \]
  Simplify and solve for \( t \):
  \[ t = 27 - 6t + 1 \]
  \[ t + 6t = 28 \]
  \[ 7t = 28 \]
  \[ t = 4 \]
  Now, substitute \( t = 4 \) back into the first equation to find \( s \):
  \[ s = 9 - 2(4) \]
  \[ s = 9 - 8 \]
  \[ s = 1 \]
  Thus, the intersection point is \( (1, 4) \).
