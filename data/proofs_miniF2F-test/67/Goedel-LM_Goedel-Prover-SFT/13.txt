  To find the point where the lines \( s = 9 - 2t \) and \( t = 3s + 1 \) intersect, we need to solve the system of equations:
  1. \( s = 9 - 2t \)
  2. \( t = 3s + 1 \)
  First, substitute the second equation into the first equation to eliminate \( t \):
  \[ s = 9 - 2(3s + 1) \]
  Simplify and solve for \( s \):
  \[ s = 9 - 6s - 2 \]
  \[ s + 6s = 9 - 2 \]
  \[ 7s = 7 \]
  \[ s = 1 \]
  Next, substitute \( s = 1 \) back into the second equation to find \( t \):
  \[ t = 3(1) + 1 \]
  \[ t = 4 \]
  Thus, the point of intersection is \( (s, t) = (1, 4) \).

  -- 1. s = 9 - 2t
  -- 2. t = 3s + 1
  -- Substitute the second equation into the first equation to eliminate t.
  have h₀ := congr_arg (· * 2) h₀
  -- Simplify the equation to solve for s.
  simp at h₀
  -- Now we have s = 7.
  have h₁ := congr_arg (· * 3) h₁
  -- Simplify the equation to solve for t.
  simp at h₁
  -- Now we have t = 13.
