  To find the intersection point of the lines \( s = 9 - 2t \) and \( t = 3s + 1 \), we need to solve the system of equations:
  1. \( s = 9 - 2t \)
  2. \( t = 3s + 1 \)
  First, substitute the second equation into the first:
  \[ s = 9 - 2(3s + 1) \]
  \[ s = 9 - 6s - 2 \]
  \[ s + 6s = 9 - 2 \]
  \[ 7s = 7 \]
  \[ s = 1 \]
  Next, substitute \( s = 1 \) back into the second equation:
  \[ t = 3(1) + 1 \]
  \[ t = 4 \]
  Thus, the intersection point is \( (1, 4) \).

  -- Solve for s using the equations
  have h : s = 1 := by
    -- Substitute h₁ into h₀ to express s in terms of t
    have h₂ : s = 9 - 2 * (3 * s + 1) := by rw [h₁] at h₀; exact h₀
    -- Simplify the equation to solve for s
    linarith
  -- Solve for t using the value of s
  have h' : t = 4 := by
    -- Substitute s = 1 into h₁ to solve for t
    rw [h] at h₁
    linarith
  -- Combine the results to get the final answer
  exact ⟨h, h'⟩
