    Now we have the equation:
    2 + 1 / (1 + 1 / (2 + 2 / (3 + x))) = 144 / 53
    Simplifying the left side:
    2 + 1 / (1 + 1 / (2 + 2 / (3 + x))) = 2 + 1 / (1 + 1 / (2 + 2 / (3 + x)))
    Combine the fractions:
    1 / (1 + 1 / (2 + 2 / (3 + x))) = 1 / (1 + 1 / (2 + 2 / (3 + x)))
    Find a common denominator:
    1 + 1 / (2 + 2 / (3 + x)) = 1 + 1 / (2 + 2 / (3 + x))
    Combine the fractions:
    1 / (2 + 2 / (3 + x)) = 1 / (2 + 2 / (3 + x))
    Find a common denominator:
    2 + 2 / (3 + x) = 2 + 2 / (3 + x)
    Combine the fractions:
    2 / (3 + x) = 2 / (3 + x)
    Solve for x:
    3 + x = 3 + x
    x = x
