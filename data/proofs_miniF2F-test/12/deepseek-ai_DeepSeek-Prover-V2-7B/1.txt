    At this point, we have:
    2 + 1 / (1 + 1 / (2 + 2 / (3 + x))) = 144 / 53
    We need to solve for x. We start by isolating the complex fraction:
    1 / (1 + 1 / (2 + 2 / (3 + x))) = 144 / 53 - 2
    Simplifying the right-hand side:
    144 / 53 - 2 = (144 - 2 * 53) / 53 = (144 - 106) / 53 = 38 / 53
    Thus, the equation becomes:
    1 / (1 + 1 / (2 + 2 / (3 + x))) = 38 / 53
    Next, we take reciprocals of both sides:
    1 + 1 / (2 + 2 / (3 + x)) = 53 / 38
    Isolating the remaining complex fraction:
    1 / (2 + 2 / (3 + x)) = 53 / 38 - 1
    Simplifying the right-hand side:
    53 / 38 - 1 = (53 - 38) / 38 = 15 / 38
    Thus, the equation becomes:
    1 / (2 + 2 / (3 + x)) = 15 / 38
    Taking reciprocals again:
    2 + 2 / (3 + x) = 38 / 15
    Isolating the remaining complex fraction:
    2 / (3 + x) = 38 / 15 - 2
    Simplifying the right-hand side:
    38 / 15 - 2 = 38 / 15 - 30 / 15 = 8 / 15
    Thus, the equation becomes:
    2 / (3 + x) = 8 / 15
    Cross-multiplying to solve for x:
    2 * 15 = 8 * (3 + x)
    30 = 24 + 8x
    30 - 24 = 8x
    6 = 8x
    x = 6 / 8 = 3 / 4
    Therefore, the value of x is 3 / 4.
