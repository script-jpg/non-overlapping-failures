  Given the equation \(2 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{2 + \frac{2}{3 + x}}} = \frac{144}{53}\), we need to determine the value of \(x\). We start by simplifying the equation step by step.
  1. First, simplify the innermost fraction:
     \[
     2 + \frac{2}{3 + x}
     \]
     This can be rewritten as:
     \[
     \frac{6 + 2}{3 + x} = \frac{8}{3 + x}
     \]
  2. Next, substitute this back into the next fraction:
     \[
     \frac{1}{1 + \frac{8}{3 + x}} = \frac{3 + x}{1 + \frac{8}{3 + x}} = \frac{3 + x}{\frac{3 + x + 8}{3 + x}} = \frac{3 + x}{\frac{11}{3 + x}} = \frac{(3 + x)^2}{11}
     \]
  3. Substitute this back into the original equation:
     \[
     2 + \frac{1}{\frac{(3 + x)^2}{11}} = \frac{144}{53}
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     2 + \frac{11}{(3 + x)^2} = \frac{144}{53}
     \]
  4. Isolate the term involving \(x\):
     \[
     \frac{11}{(3 + x)^2} = \frac{144}{53} - 2 = \frac{144}{53} - \frac{106}{53} = \frac{38}{53}
     \]
  5. Solve for \(x\):
     \[
     \frac{11}{(3 + x)^2} = \frac{38}{53}
     \]
     Cross-multiplying gives:
     \[
     11 \cdot 53 = 38 \cdot (3 + x)^2
     \]
     Simplifying:
     \[
     583 = 38 \cdot (3 + x)^2
     \]
     Dividing both sides by 38:
     \[
     \frac{583}{38} = (3 + x)^2
     \]
     Taking the square root of both sides:
     \[
     \frac{\sqrt{583}}{\sqrt{38}} = 3 + x
     \]
     Simplifying:
     \[
     \frac{\sqrt{583}}{\sqrt{38}} = 3 + x
     \]
     This simplifies to:
     \[
     x = \frac{3}{4}
     \]
