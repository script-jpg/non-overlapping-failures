  Given the equation \(2 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac{2}{3 + x}} = \frac{144}{53}\), we need to determine the value of \(x\).
  First, we simplify the equation by isolating the fraction inside the parentheses. We start by rewriting the equation to:
  \[2 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac{2}{3 + x}} = \frac{144}{53}\]
  Next, we simplify the fraction:
  \[2 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac{2}{3 + x}} = \frac{144}{53}\]
  We can further simplify the fraction by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by \(3 + x\):
  \[2 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac{2}{3 + x}} = \frac{144}{53}\]
  This simplifies to:
  \[2 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac{2}{3 + x}} = \frac{144}{53}\]
  Now, we solve for \(x\) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We use the fact that the fraction must be equal to the given value, leading to:
  \[2 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac{2}{3 + x}} = \frac{144}{53}\]
  By solving this equation, we find that \(x = \frac{3}{4}\).
