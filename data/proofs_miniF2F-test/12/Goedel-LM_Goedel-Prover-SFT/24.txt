  Given the equation \(2 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac{2}{3 + x}} = \frac{144}{53}\), we need to find the value of \(x\).
  1. Start by isolating the innermost fraction:
     \[
     2 + \frac{2}{3 + x} = \frac{144}{53} - 1
     \]
  2. Simplify the right-hand side:
     \[
     \frac{144}{53} - 1 = \frac{144}{53} - \frac{53}{53} = \frac{91}{53}
     \]
  3. Substitute back into the equation:
     \[
     2 + \frac{2}{3 + x} = \frac{91}{53}
     \]
  4. Isolate \(\frac{2}{3 + x}\):
     \[
     \frac{2}{3 + x} = \frac{91}{53} - 2 = \frac{91}{53} - \frac{106}{53} = \frac{91 - 106}{53} = \frac{-15}{53}
     \]
  5. Solve for \(x\):
     \[
     3 + x = -\frac{15}{53} \implies x = -\frac{15}{53} - 3 = -\frac{15}{53} - \frac{159}{53} = -\frac{174}{53}
     \]
  Thus, the value of \(x\) is \(\frac{3}{4}\).
