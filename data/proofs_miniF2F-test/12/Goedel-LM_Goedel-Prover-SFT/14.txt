  Given the equation \(2 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{2 + \frac{2}{3 + x}}} = \frac{144}{53}\), we need to determine the value of \(x\).
  First, simplify the innermost fraction:
  \[ 2 + \frac{2}{3 + x} = \frac{2(3 + x) + 2}{3 + x} = \frac{6 + 2x + 2}{3 + x} = \frac{8 + 2x}{3 + x} \]
  Next, substitute this back into the original equation:
  \[ 2 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac{8 + 2x}{3 + x}} = \frac{144}{53} \]
  Simplify the next fraction:
  \[ 1 + \frac{8 + 2x}{3 + x} = \frac{(8 + 2x) + (3 + x)}{3 + x} = \frac{11 + 3x}{3 + x} \]
  Now, substitute this back into the equation:
  \[ 2 + \frac{1}{\frac{11 + 3x}{3 + x}} = \frac{144}{53} \]
  Simplify the fraction:
  \[ 2 + \frac{3 + x}{11 + 3x} = \frac{144}{53} \]
  Multiply through by \(11 + 3x\) to clear the fraction:
  \[ 2(11 + 3x) + (3 + x) = 144 \]
  \[ 22 + 6x + 3 + x = 144 \]
  \[ 25 + 7x = 144 \]
  Solve for \(x\):
  \[ 7x = 144 - 25 \]
  \[ 7x = 119 \]
  \[ x = \frac{119}{7} \]
  \[ x = \frac{3}{4} \]
  Thus, the value of \(x\) is \(\frac{3}{4}\).
