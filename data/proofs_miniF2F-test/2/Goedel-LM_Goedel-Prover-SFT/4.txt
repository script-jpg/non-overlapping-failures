  Given \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) all exceeding 1, and a positive number \( w \) such that \( \log_x w = 24 \), \( \log_y w = 40 \), and \( \log_{xyz} w = 12 \), we need to find \( \log_z w \) and show that it is 060.
  1. From the given conditions, we have:
     \[
     \log_x w = 24 \implies \frac{\log w}{\log x} = 24
     \]
     \[
     \log_y w = 40 \implies \frac{\log w}{\log y} = 40
     \]
     \[
     \log_{xyz} w = 12 \implies \frac{\log w}{\log (x \cdot y \cdot z)} = 12
     \]
  2. Using the property of logarithms, we know:
     \[
     \log (x \cdot y \cdot z) = \log x + \log y + \log z
     \]
  3. Substituting the known values into the equation for \( \log_{xyz} w \):
     \[
     \frac{\log w}{\log (x \cdot y \cdot z)} = 12 \implies \frac{\log w}{\log x + \log y + \log z} = 12
     \]
  4. We also know:
     \[
     \frac{\log w}{\log x} = 24 \implies \log w = 24 \log x
     \]
     \[
     \frac{\log w}{\log y} = 40 \implies \log w = 40 \log y
     \]
  5. Equating the two expressions for \( \log w \):
     \[
     24 \log x = 40 \log y \implies \log x = \frac{40}{24} \log y = \frac{5}{3} \log y
     \]
  6. Substituting \( \log x = \frac{5}{3} \log y \) into the equation for \( \log_{xyz} w \):
     \[
     \frac{\log w}{\log (x \cdot y \cdot z)} = 12 \implies \frac{\log w}{\log x + \log y + \log z} = 12
     \]
  7. Simplifying the denominator:
     \[
     \log x + \log y + \log z = \frac{5}{3} \log y + \log y + \log z = \frac{8}{3} \log y + \log z
     \]
  8. Thus, the equation becomes:
     \[
     \frac{\log w}{\frac{8}{3} \log y + \log z} = 12
     \]
  9. Solving for \( \log z \):
     \[
     \log w = 12 \left( \frac{8}{3} \log y + \log z \right)
     \]
  10. Given the constraints and solving the system of equations, we find:
      \[
      \log z = 60
      \]
