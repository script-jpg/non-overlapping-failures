  Given \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) all exceed 1 and let \( w \) be a positive number such that \( \log_x w = 24 \), \( \log_y w = 40 \), and \( \log_{xyz} w = 12 \). We need to find \( \log_z w \) and show that it is 060.
  1. Start by expressing the given logarithmic equations in terms of the natural logarithm.
  2. Use the properties of logarithms to combine and simplify the equations.
  3. Solve the system of equations to find the value of \( \log_z w \).
