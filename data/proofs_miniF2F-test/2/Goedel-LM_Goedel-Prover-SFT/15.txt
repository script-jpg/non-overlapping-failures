  Given \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) all greater than 1 and a positive number \( w \) such that \( \log_x w = 24 \), \( \log_y w = 40 \), and \( \log_{xyz} w = 12 \), we need to find \( \log_z w \) and show that it equals 060.
  First, we use the properties of logarithms to express the given conditions:
  1. \( \log_x w = 24 \) implies \( \frac{\log w}{\log x} = 24 \).
  2. \( \log_y w = 40 \) implies \( \frac{\log w}{\log y} = 40 \).
  3. \( \log_{xyz} w = 12 \) implies \( \frac{\log w}{\log (x \cdot y \cdot z)} = 12 \).
  We need to find \( \log_z w \), which is \( \frac{\log w}{\log z} \).
  From the given conditions, we can derive the following relationships:
  \[ \log w = 24 \log x \]
  \[ \log w = 40 \log y \]
  \[ \log w = 12 \log (x \cdot y \cdot z) \]
  Since \( \log (x \cdot y \cdot z) = \log x + \log y + \log z \), we substitute this into the third equation:
  \[ \log w = 12 (\log x + \log y + \log z) \]
  We now have three equations for \( \log w \):
  \[ 24 \log x = 40 \log y \]
  \[ 24 \log x = 12 (\log x + \log y + \log z) \]
  From the first equation, we can express \( \log y \) in terms of \( \log x \):
  \[ \log y = \frac{24 \log x}{40} = \frac{3 \log x}{5} \]
  Substitute \( \log y \) into the second equation:
  \[ 24 \log x = 12 (\log x + \frac{3 \log x}{5} + \log z) \]
  Simplify the equation:
  \[ 24 \log x = 12 \left( \log x + \frac{3 \log x}{5} + \log z \right) \]
  \[ 24 \log x = 12 \log x + \frac{36 \log x}{5} + 12 \log z \]
  \[ 24 \log x = 12 \log x + 7.2 \log x + 12 \log z \]
  \[ 24 \log x = 19.2 \log x + 12 \log z \]
  \[ 24 \log x - 19.2 \log x = 12 \log z \]
  \[ 4.8 \log x = 12 \log z \]
  \[ \log z = \frac{4.8 \log x}{12} = 0.4 \log x \]
  Now, we need to find \( \log_z w \):
  \[ \log_z w = \frac{\log w}{\log z} \]
  \[ \log_z w = \frac{24 \log x}{0.4 \log x} = \frac{24}{0.4} = 60 \]
  Thus, \( \log_z w = 60 \).
