  Given \( x \), \( y \), \( z \) all exceeding 1 and a positive number \( w \) such that \( \log_x w = 24 \), \( \log_y w = 40 \), and \( \log_{xyz} w = 12 \), we need to find \( \log_z w \).
  1. Start by expressing the given logarithmic equations in terms of \( \log w \) and \( \log x \), \( \log y \), and \( \log z \).
  2. Use the properties of logarithms to combine and simplify these equations.
  3. Solve the resulting system of equations to find \( \log_z w \).
