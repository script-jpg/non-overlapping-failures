  Given \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) all exceed 1 and let \( w \) be a positive number such that \( \log_x w = 24 \), \( \log_y w = 40 \), and \( \log_{xyz} w = 12 \). We need to find \( \log_z w \) and show that it is 060.
  1. From the given conditions, we have:
     \[
     \log_x w = 24 \implies \frac{\log w}{\log x} = 24
     \]
     \[
     \log_y w = 40 \implies \frac{\log w}{\log y} = 40
     \]
     \[
     \log_{xyz} w = 12 \implies \frac{\log w}{\log (x \cdot y \cdot z)} = 12
     \]
  2. Using the properties of logarithms, we know:
     \[
     \log (x \cdot y \cdot z) = \log x + \log y + \log z
     \]
  3. Substituting \( \log (x \cdot y \cdot z) \) into the third equation:
     \[
     \frac{\log w}{\log (x \cdot y \cdot z)} = 12 \implies \frac{\log w}{\log x + \log y + \log z} = 12
     \]
  4. We also know:
     \[
     \frac{\log w}{\log x} = 24 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{\log w}{\log y} = 40
     \]
  5. To find \( \log_z w \), we need to solve for \( \log w \) in terms of \( \log z \):
     \[
     \log w = 24 \log x \quad \text{and} \quad \log w = 40 \log y
     \]
  6. Equating the two expressions for \( \log w \):
     \[
     24 \log x = 40 \log y \implies \log x = \frac{40}{24} \log y = \frac{5}{3} \log y
     \]
  7. Substituting \( \log x \) back into the equation for \( \log w \):
     \[
     \log w = 24 \left( \frac{5}{3} \log y \right) = 40 \log y
     \]
  8. Now, substituting \( \log w \) and \( \log (x \cdot y \cdot z) \) into the equation for \( \log_z w \):
     \[
     \frac{\log w}{\log z} = 60
     \]
