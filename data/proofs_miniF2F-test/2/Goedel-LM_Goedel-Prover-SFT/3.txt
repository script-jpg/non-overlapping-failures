  Given \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) all exceed 1 and a positive number \( w \) such that \( \log_x w = 24 \), \( \log_y w = 40 \), and \( \log_{xyz} w = 12 \), we need to find \( \log_z w \).
  First, we note that since \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) all exceed 1, the logarithms involved are positive. We can express the given logarithmic equations in terms of the natural logarithm:
  1. \( \frac{\log w}{\log x} = 24 \)
  2. \( \frac{\log w}{\log y} = 40 \)
  3. \( \frac{\log w}{\log (x \cdot y \cdot z)} = 12 \)
  From these equations, we can derive the following relationships:
  1. \( \log w = 24 \log x \)
  2. \( \log w = 40 \log y \)
  3. \( \log w = 12 \log (x \cdot y \cdot z) \)
  Since \( x \cdot y \cdot z = xyz \), we have:
  \[ \log w = 12 \log (xyz) \]
  Given that \( \log (xyz) = \log x + \log y + \log z \), we substitute:
  \[ \log w = 12 (\log x + \log y + \log z) \]
  From the first two equations, we can solve for \( \log x \) and \( \log y \):
  \[ \log x = \frac{\log w}{24} \]
  \[ \log y = \frac{\log w}{40} \]
  Substituting these into the third equation:
  \[ \log w = 12 \left( \frac{\log w}{24} + \frac{\log w}{40} + \log z \right) \]
  Simplifying the right-hand side:
  \[ \log w = 12 \left( \frac{5 \log w + 3 \log w + 24 \log z}{120} \right) \]
  \[ \log w = \frac{12 \log w + 288 \log z}{120} \]
  \[ \log w = \frac{12 \log w + 288 \log z}{120} \]
  \[ 120 \log w = 12 \log w + 288 \log z \]
  \[ 108 \log w = 288 \log z \]
  \[ \log z = \frac{108 \log w}{288} \]
  \[ \log z = \frac{3 \log w}{8} \]
  Thus, \( \log_z w = \frac{3}{8} \).
