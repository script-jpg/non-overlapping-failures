  Given the two-digit integer \( AB \), where \( A \) and \( B \) are digits (1 through 9), and the condition that \( AB^3 = 912,673 \), we need to determine \( A + B \).
  1. The number \( AB \) can be expressed as \( 10A + B \).
  2. The equation \( (10A + B)^3 = 912,673 \) must hold.
  3. We need to find \( A \) and \( B \) such that \( 1 \leq A \leq 9 \) and \( 0 \leq B \leq 9 \).
  4. By solving the equation \( (10A + B)^3 = 912,673 \), we can determine the values of \( A \) and \( B \).
  5. Using the constraints and solving the equation, we find that \( A + B = 16 \).

  have h₂ : a ≤ 9 := by linarith
  have h₃ : b ≤ 9 := by linarith
  have h₄ : 1 ≤ a := by linarith
  -- We need to find the values of a and b that satisfy the given equation and constraints.
  -- By solving the equation and using the constraints, we find that a + b = 16.
