  Given the two-digit integer \( \text{AB} \), we know that its cube is \( 912,673 \). We need to find the sum \( A + B \).
  1. Start by expressing \( \text{AB} \) as \( 10A + B \).
  2. Given \( (10A + B)^3 = 912,673 \), we can use this equation to find \( A \) and \( B \).
  3. Use the fact that \( 1 \leq A \leq 9 \) and \( 0 \leq B \leq 9 \) to narrow down the possible values of \( A \) and \( B \).
  4. By testing values, we find that \( A = 9 \) and \( B = 7 \) satisfy the equation \( (10 \cdot 9 + 7)^3 = 912,673 \).
  5. Therefore, \( A + B = 9 + 7 = 16 \).
