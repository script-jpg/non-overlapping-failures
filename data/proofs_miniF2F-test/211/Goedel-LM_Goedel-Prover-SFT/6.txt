  Given the two-digit integer \( \text{AB} \), we need to show that when this integer is cubed, the result is \( 912,673 \). We also need to determine \( A + B \).
  1. Start by expressing the two-digit integer \( \text{AB} \) as \( 10A + B \), where \( A \) and \( B \) are digits (i.e., \( 1 \leq A \leq 9 \) and \( 0 \leq B \leq 9 \)).
  2. Given the equation \( (10A + B)^3 = 912,673 \), we need to find \( A \) and \( B \) such that this equation holds.
  3. We know \( 1 \leq A \leq 9 \) and \( 0 \leq B \leq 9 \).
  4. By testing possible values of \( A \) and \( B \) that satisfy the equation, we find that \( A = 9 \) and \( B = 7 \) satisfy the equation.
  5. Therefore, \( A + B = 9 + 7 = 16 \).
