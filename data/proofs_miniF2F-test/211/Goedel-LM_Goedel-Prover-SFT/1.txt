  Given the two-digit integer \( \text{AB} \) where \( A \) and \( B \) are digits (i.e., \( 1 \leq A \leq 9 \) and \( 0 \leq B \leq 9 \)), we need to show that when \( \text{AB} \) is cubed, the result is 912,673. We aim to prove that \( A + B = 16 \).
  1. Start by noting that \( \text{AB} \) can be represented as \( 10A + B \).
  2. Given \( (10A + B)^3 = 912,673 \), we can use this equation to find the values of \( A \) and \( B \).
  3. Use the constraints \( 1 \leq A \leq 9 \) and \( 0 \leq B \leq 9 \) to narrow down the possible values of \( A \) and \( B \).
  4. Apply algebraic manipulation and simplification to the equation \( (10A + B)^3 = 912,673 \) to find the values of \( A \) and \( B \).
  5. Verify that \( A + B = 16 \) satisfies the equation and the constraints.
