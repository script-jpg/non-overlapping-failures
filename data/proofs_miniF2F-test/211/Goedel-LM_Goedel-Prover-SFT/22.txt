  Given the two-digit integer \( AB \) where \( A \) and \( B \) are digits (i.e., \( 1 \leq A \leq 9 \) and \( 0 \leq B \leq 9 \)), we are to find \( A + B \) such that when \( AB \) is cubed, the result is \( 912673 \). We start by noting that the cube root of \( 912673 \) is \( 21 \). Therefore, \( AB = 21 \). Since \( A \) and \( B \) are digits, the only solution is \( A = 2 \) and \( B = 1 \), giving \( A + B = 3 \).

  -- We know that the cube root of 912673 is 21, so AB = 21.
  have : (10 * a + b) = 21 := by
    apply Eq.symm
    -- We use the fact that 21^3 = 912673 to conclude that 10a + b must be 21.
    nlinarith [pow_two (10 * a + b), pow_two (10 * a + b - 21), pow_two (10 * a + b + 21)]
  -- Since AB = 21, we have A = 2 and B = 1, so A + B = 3.
