  Given the two-digit integer \( \text{AB} \) where \( A \) and \( B \) are digits (i.e., \( 1 \leq A \leq 9 \) and \( 0 \leq B \leq 9 \)), we need to find the value of \( A + B \) such that \( \text{AB}^3 = 912673 \).
  First, we express \( \text{AB} \) as \( 10A + B \). The equation given is:
  \[
  (10A + B)^3 = 912673
  \]
  We can rewrite this equation as:
  \[
  1000A^3 + 3000A^2B + 300AB^2 + 1B^3 = 912673
  \]
  Since \( A \) and \( B \) are digits, we can use the constraints \( 1 \leq A \leq 9 \) and \( 0 \leq B \leq 9 \) to solve for \( A \) and \( B \). By trial and error or systematic solving, we find that \( A = 9 \) and \( B = 7 \) satisfy the equation.
  Thus, \( A + B = 9 + 7 = 16 \).

  -- We start by noting the constraints on a and b.
  have h₀ := h₀
  have h₁ := h₁
  have h₂ : 1 ≤ a := by linarith
  have h₃ : a ≤ 9 := by linarith
  have h₄ : 0 ≤ b := by linarith
  have h₅ : b ≤ 9 := by linarith
  -- We use the fact that a and b are digits to narrow down the possible values.
  interval_cases a <;> interval_cases b <;> simp_all
  -- Finally, we use the constraints to conclude that a + b = 16.
