  Given the two-digit integer \( \text{AB} \) where \( \text{AB} \) is cubed to yield \( 912,673 \), we need to determine \( A + B \). We start by expressing \( \text{AB} \) as \( 10A + B \). The equation \( (10A + B)^3 = 912,673 \) must hold. We simplify this equation by expanding and rearranging terms. Using the properties of cubes and the specific values involved, we solve for \( A \) and \( B \). Through algebraic manipulation and checking the possible values within the given constraints, we find that \( A + B = 16 \).
