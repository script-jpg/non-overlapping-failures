  Given the two-digit integer \( \text{AB} \), we need to find \( A + B \) such that \( (10A + B)^3 = 912673 \). We start by noting that \( 1 \leq A \leq 9 \) and \( 0 \leq B \leq 9 \). We then use the fact that \( (10A + B)^3 = 912673 \) to solve for \( A \) and \( B \). By simplifying and solving the equation, we find that \( A + B = 16 \).

  -- We start by noting the constraints on a and b.
  have h₁ := h₀
  have h₂ : a ≤ 9 := by linarith
  have h₃ : b ≤ 9 := by linarith
  -- We use interval_cases to check all possible values of a and b within the constraints.
  interval_cases a <;> interval_cases b <;> simp_all
  -- We use linarith to solve the resulting equations and conclude that a + b = 16.
