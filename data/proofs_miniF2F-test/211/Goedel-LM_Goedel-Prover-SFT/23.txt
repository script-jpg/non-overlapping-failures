  Given the two-digit integer \( \text{AB} \) is cubed, resulting in \( 912,673 \), we need to determine \( A + B \). The constraints are that \( 1 \leq A \leq 9 \) and \( 0 \leq B \leq 9 \). We start by simplifying the given equation \( (10A + B)^3 = 912,673 \). Using the properties of powers and multiplication, we can break down the equation into simpler components. By solving these components, we find that \( A + B = 16 \).
