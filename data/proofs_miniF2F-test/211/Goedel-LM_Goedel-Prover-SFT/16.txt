  Given the two-digit integer \(AB\) where \(A\) and \(B\) are digits (i.e., \(1 \leq A \leq 9\) and \(0 \leq B \leq 9\)), we are to show that if \(AB\) cubed equals \(912,673\), then \(A + B = 16\).
  1. Start by expressing \(AB\) as \(10A + B\).
  2. Given the equation \((10A + B)^3 = 912,673\), we need to solve for \(A\) and \(B\).
  3. Recognize that \(912,673\) can be factored into primes as \(7^3 \times 13 \times 17\).
  4. Since \(10A + B\) must be a multiple of \(7\), we can write \(10A + B = 7k\) for some integer \(k\).
  5. Given the constraints \(1 \leq A \leq 9\) and \(0 \leq B \leq 9\), we can solve for \(A\) and \(B\) by checking possible values that satisfy the equation and the constraints.
  6. Through solving the equation and checking the constraints, we find that \(A = 9\) and \(B = 7\) satisfy the equation and the constraints.
  7. Therefore, \(A + B = 9 + 7 = 16\).

  -- We know that 10A + B is a two-digit number, so it is between 10 and 99.
  have : 10 ≤ 10 * a + b := by linarith
  -- We need to show that A + B = 16.
  have : a + b = 16 := by
    -- Use the fact that 10A + B cubed equals 912673 to solve for A and B.
    have : (10 * a + b) ^ 3 = 912673 := by linarith
    -- Use the constraints on A and B to find the possible values.
    have : a ≤ 9 := by linarith
    have : b ≤ 9 := by linarith
    -- Use interval_cases to check possible values of A and B.
    interval_cases a <;> interval_cases b <;> simp_all
  -- The final result is A + B = 16.
