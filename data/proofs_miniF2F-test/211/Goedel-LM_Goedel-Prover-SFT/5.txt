  Given the two-digit integer \( \text{AB} \) is cubed, the value is \( 912,673 \). We need to find \( A + B \). We know that \( \text{AB} \) can be expressed as \( 10A + B \), where \( A \) and \( B \) are the digits. The equation to solve is \( (10A + B)^3 = 912,673 \). We will use the fact that \( A \) and \( B \) are single digits and solve for \( A \) and \( B \).
  First, we simplify the equation \( (10A + B)^3 = 912,673 \). By expanding and simplifying, we find that \( A \) and \( B \) must satisfy certain conditions. Given the constraints on \( A \) and \( B \) (both are between 1 and 9), we can solve for \( A \) and \( B \) using a system of equations derived from the given value.
  Finally, we sum \( A \) and \( B \) and verify that their sum is 16.
