  Given the two-digit integer \( \text{AB} \) is cubed, the value is \( 912,673 \). We need to find \( A + B \).
  1. Start by expressing the given equation \( (10A + B)^3 = 912673 \).
  2. Expand the cube of the binomial \( (10A + B) \) using the binomial theorem.
  3. Simplify the expanded form to match the given value \( 912673 \).
  4. Use the properties of the digits \( A \) and \( B \) (both between 1 and 9) to solve for \( A \) and \( B \).
  5. Verify that the sum \( A + B \) equals 16.
