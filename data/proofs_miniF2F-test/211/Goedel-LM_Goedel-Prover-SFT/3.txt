  Given the two-digit integer \( \text{AB} \), we know that \( 1 \leq A \leq 9 \) and \( 0 \leq B \leq 9 \). We are given that \( (\text{AB})^3 = 912673 \). We need to find \( A + B \).
  First, we simplify the equation \( (\text{AB})^3 = 912673 \) by expanding the cube and simplifying the resulting expression. We then use the constraints on \( A \) and \( B \) to solve for \( A + B \).
