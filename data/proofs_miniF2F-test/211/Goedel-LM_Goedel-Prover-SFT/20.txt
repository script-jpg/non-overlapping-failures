  Given a two-digit integer represented as \( \text{AB} \), where \( \text{A} \) and \( \text{B} \) are digits (i.e., \( 1 \leq \text{A} \leq 9 \) and \( 0 \leq \text{B} \leq 9 \)), we are to find the value of \( \text{A} + \text{B} \) when the cube of the two-digit number is \( 912673 \). We start by expressing the given condition mathematically:
  \[
  (10 \cdot \text{A} + \text{B})^3 = 912673
  \]
  Given the constraints on \( \text{A} \) and \( \text{B} \), we can use the properties of cubes and the range of digits to solve for \( \text{A} + \text{B} \). By analyzing the possible values of \( \text{A} \) and \( \text{B} \) that satisfy the equation, we find that the only solution that fits within the digit constraints is \( \text{A} = 9 \) and \( \text{B} = 7 \). Therefore, the sum \( \text{A} + \text{B} \) is:
  \[
  9 + 7 = 16
  \]

  -- We start by considering the range of possible values for A and B.
  have h₁ : (10 * a + b) ^ 3 = 912673 := by simpa using h₁
  have h₂ : a + b = 16 := by
    -- We know that a is between 1 and 9, and b is between 0 and 9.
    have : a ≤ 9 := by linarith
    have : b ≤ 9 := by linarith
    -- We use interval_cases to check all possible values of a and b.
    interval_cases a <;> interval_cases b <;> simp_all
  -- Finally, we conclude that the sum of a and b is 16.
