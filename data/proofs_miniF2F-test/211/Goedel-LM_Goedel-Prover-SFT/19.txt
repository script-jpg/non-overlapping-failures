  Given the two-digit integer \( \text{AB} \) is cubed, and the value is \( 912,673 \), we need to show that \( A + B \) is 16. We start by expressing \( \text{AB} \) as \( 10A + B \). The equation provided is \( (10A + B)^3 = 912,673 \). We use the properties of modular arithmetic to simplify the problem. Specifically, we consider the cube of \( 10A + B \) modulo 10 and 100 to derive constraints on \( A \) and \( B \). By analyzing these constraints, we find that \( A = 9 \) and \( B = 7 \), leading to \( A + B = 16 \).

  -- Use the constraints derived from the modulo operations to solve for A and B.
  have h₄ : a ≤ 9 := by linarith
  have h₅ : b ≤ 9 := by linarith
  -- Use interval cases to find the values of A and B that satisfy the given conditions.
