  Given a two-digit integer \( AB \) represented as \( 10a + b \) where \( a \) and \( b \) are digits (i.e., \( 1 \leq a \leq 9 \) and \( 0 \leq b \leq 9 \)), we are to show that if \( (10a + b)^3 = 912673 \), then \( a + b = 16 \).
  1. Start by simplifying the given equation \( (10a + b)^3 = 912673 \).
  2. Use algebraic manipulation to express the equation in a more manageable form.
  3. Apply numerical and arithmetic properties to derive the values of \( a \) and \( b \).
  4. Verify that the sum \( a + b \) equals 16.
