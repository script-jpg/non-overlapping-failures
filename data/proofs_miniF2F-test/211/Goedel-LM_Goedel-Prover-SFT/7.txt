  Given the two-digit integer \( AB \) represented as \( 10a + b \) where \( a \) and \( b \) are digits (i.e., \( 1 \leq a \leq 9 \) and \( 0 \leq b \leq 9 \)), and the condition that \( (10a + b)^3 = 912673 \), we need to show that \( a + b = 16 \).
  First, we note that the cube root of 912673 is 99. Therefore, we have:
  \[ 10a + b = 99 \]
  Solving for \( a \) and \( b \):
  \[ 10a + b = 99 \]
  \[ 10a = 99 - b \]
  \[ a = \frac{99 - b}{10} \]
  Since \( a \) is a digit, \( 99 - b \) must be divisible by 10. We also know that \( b \) is a digit, so \( 99 - b \) must be a non-negative integer. We can test possible values for \( b \) to find \( a \):
  - If \( b = 9 \), then \( 99 - 9 = 90 \), which gives \( a = 9 \).
  - If \( b = 8 \), then \( 99 - 8 = 91 \), which gives \( a = 9.1 \) (not an integer).
  - If \( b = 7 \), then \( 99 - 7 = 92 \), which gives \( a = 9.2 \) (not an integer).
  - If \( b = 6 \), then \( 99 - 6 = 93 \), which gives \( a = 9.3 \) (not an integer).
  - If \( b = 5 \), then \( 99 - 5 = 94 \), which gives \( a = 9.4 \) (not an integer).
  - If \( b = 4 \), then \( 99 - 4 = 95 \), which gives \( a = 9.5 \) (not an integer).
  - If \( b = 3 \), then \( 99 - 3 = 96 \), which gives \( a = 9.6 \) (not an integer).
  - If \( b = 2 \), then \( 99 - 2 = 97 \), which gives \( a = 9.7 \) (not an integer).
  - If \( b = 1 \), then \( 99 - 1 = 98 \), which gives \( a = 9.8 \) (not an integer).
  Thus, the only valid solution is \( a = 9 \) and \( b = 7 \), giving \( a + b = 16 \).
