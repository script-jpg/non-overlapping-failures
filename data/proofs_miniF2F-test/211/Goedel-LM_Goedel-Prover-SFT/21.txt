  Given a two-digit integer \( \text{AB} \), we need to find \( A + B \) when \( AB \) is cubed to yield 912,673. We start by expressing \( AB \) as \( 10A + B \). The equation \( (10A + B)^3 = 912673 \) must hold true. We then use algebraic manipulation and numerical analysis to determine the values of \( A \) and \( B \) that satisfy this equation. By simplifying and checking the constraints, we find that \( A + B = 16 \).
