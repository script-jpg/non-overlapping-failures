  Given the two-digit integer \( AB \) where \( 1 \leq A \leq 9 \) and \( 0 \leq B \leq 9 \), and the condition that \( AB^3 = 912673 \), we need to determine \( A + B \). We will show that \( A + B = 16 \).
  First, we express \( AB \) as \( 10A + B \). The equation \( AB^3 = 912673 \) can be rewritten as \( (10A + B)^3 = 912673 \). We use the properties of powers and the fact that \( 10A + B \) must be a specific integer that, when cubed, equals 912673. By solving the equation and considering the constraints on \( A \) and \( B \), we find that \( A + B = 16 \).

  -- We start by simplifying the equation (10a + b)^3 = 912673
  have h₁' : (10 * a + b) ^ 3 = 912673 := by simpa using h₁
  -- We use the properties of powers and the fact that 10a + b must be a specific integer
  have h₂ : 10 * a + b = 149 := by
    -- We solve the equation (10a + b)^3 = 912673 using numerical methods or by inspection
    have : 10 * a + b ≤ 99 := by linarith
    interval_cases 10 * a + b <;> norm_num at h₁' <;> omega
  -- Now we have 10a + b = 149, we solve for a and b
  have h₃ : a + b = 16 := by
    -- We use the fact that 10a + b = 149 to find a and b
    have : a ≤ 9 := by linarith
    have : b ≤ 9 := by linarith
    -- We solve the equation 10a + b = 149 to find a = 14 and b = 9
    interval_cases a <;> interval_cases b <;> omega
  -- Finally, we conclude that a + b = 16
