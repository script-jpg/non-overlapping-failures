  Given the two-digit integer \( \text{AB} \) is cubed, the value is \( 912,673 \). We need to find \( A + B \). By examining the equation \( (10A + B)^3 = 912673 \), we can determine that \( 10A + B = 27 \). Solving for \( A \) and \( B \), we find \( A = 2 \) and \( B = 7 \). Therefore, \( A + B = 2 + 7 = 9 \).

  have h₂ : a + b = 16 := by
    -- We start by noting the given conditions and the equation.
    have h₃ : (10 * a + b) ^ 3 = 912673 := h₁
    have h₄ : 1 ≤ a ∧ a ≤ 9 ∧ b ≤ 9 := h₀
    -- We use `nlinarith` to solve the equation and find the values of `a` and `b`.
    nlinarith [pow_two (10 * a + b), pow_two (10 * a + b - 1), pow_two (10 * a + b + 1)]
  -- Finally, we conclude that `a + b = 16`.
