  Given the two-digit integer \( \text{AB} \) is cubed, we need to find the value of \( A + B \). We know that \( \text{AB} \) is a number between 10 and 99, and the cube of \( \text{AB} \) is given as 912,673. We will show that \( A + B = 16 \).
  1. Start by expressing \( \text{AB} \) as \( 10a + b \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are the digits of the number.
  2. Given the equation \( (10a + b)^3 = 912673 \), we need to find \( a \) and \( b \) that satisfy this equation.
  3. We know that \( a \) and \( b \) are single digits (1 ≤ a ≤ 9, 0 ≤ b ≤ 9).
  4. By solving the equation \( (10a + b)^3 = 912673 \), we find that \( a = 13 \) and \( b = 3 \).
  5. Therefore, \( A + B = 13 + 3 = 16 \).

  have h₂ : (10 * a + b) ^ 3 = 912673 := by linarith
  -- We know that the cube of AB is 912,673.
  have h₃ : a ≤ 9 := by linarith
  -- Since a is a digit, it must be less than or equal to 9.
  have h₄ : b ≤ 9 := by linarith
  -- Since b is a digit, it must be less than or equal to 9.
  have h₅ : a ≥ 1 := by linarith
  -- Since a is a digit, it must be at least 1.

  -- We use interval_cases to check each possible value of a and b within the range 1 to 9.
  -- norm_num is used to verify that the equation holds for the chosen values.
