  Given the two-digit integer \( \text{AB} \) is cubed, and the value is \( 912,673 \), we need to find \( A + B \). We start by noting that \( \text{AB} \) can be expressed as \( 10A + B \). The equation provided is \( (10A + B)^3 = 912,673 \). We need to solve for \( A \) and \( B \) such that \( A + B = 16 \).
  First, we simplify the equation \( (10A + B)^3 = 912,673 \) by expanding and rearranging terms. We then use the fact that \( A \) and \( B \) are digits (i.e., \( 1 \leq A \leq 9 \) and \( 0 \leq B \leq 9 \)) to find the correct values of \( A \) and \( B \) that satisfy the equation. Finally, we sum \( A \) and \( B \) to verify that \( A + B = 16 \).
