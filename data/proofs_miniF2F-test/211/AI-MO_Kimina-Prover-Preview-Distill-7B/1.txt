-- The cube of a two-digit number is 912673. We need to find the two-digit number and then calculate the sum of its digits.

  -- First, let's think about how to approach this problem. We have a two-digit number $\text{AB}$, which means $10A + B$ where $1 \leq A \leq 9$ and $0 \leq B \leq 9$. We need to find $A$ and $B$ such that $(10A + B)^3 = 912673$.

  -- Let's start by importing the necessary libraries and setting up the theorem statement:

  import Mathlib
  import Aesop

  set_option maxHeartbeats 0

  open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat

  -- Now, let's define the theorem:

  theorem mathd_numbertheory_234 (a b : ℕ) (h₀ : 1 ≤ a ∧ a ≤ 9 ∧ b ≤ 9)
      (h₁ : (10 * a + b) ^ 3 = 912673) : a + b = 16 := by

    -- We've declared our theorem with variables a and b representing the digits A and B, with the constraint that a is between 1 and 9, b is between 0 and 9, and the cube of the two-digit number equals 912673.

    -- Let's think about how to solve this algebraically before diving further into the proof. We have:
    -- (10a + b)^3 = 912673
    -- Taking the cube root of both sides:
    -- 10a + b = ∛912673

    -- Calculating the cube root of 912673:
    -- 912673^(1/3) = 97.0

    -- So we have 10a + b = 97, which means:
    -- 10a + b = 97
    -- 10a = 97 - b
    -- a = (97 - b) / 10

    -- Since a must be an integer between 1 and 9, and b must be an integer between 0 and 9, we can determine the values of a and b by checking possible values of b.

    -- If b = 7, then a = (97 - 7) / 10 = 90 / 10 = 9
    -- This gives us a = 9 and b = 7, which satisfies our constraints.

    -- Let's verify:
    -- (10 * 9 + 7)^3 = 97^3 = 912673 ✓

    -- Therefore, A = 9 and B = 7, so A + B = 9 + 7 = 16.

    have h2 : 10 * a + b = 97 := by
      rw [pow_left_inj₀ (by norm_num) (by norm_num) (by norm_num)] at h₁
      exact h₁

    have h3 : a = 9 := by
      omega

    have h4 : b = 7 := by
      omega

    calc
      a + b = 9 + 7 := by rw [h3, h4]
      _ = 16 := by norm_num

  -- In this proof, we've shown that the two-digit number whose cube is 912673 is 97, and the sum of its digits is 9 + 7 = 16.

  -- The key insight was that we could determine the original number (97) from its cube (912673) by taking the cube root. Since 97^3 = 912673, and 97 is a two-digit number with digits 9 and 7, we found that A = 9 and B = 7, giving A + B = 16.
</-- When the two-digit integer $``\text{AB}"$ is cubed, the value is $912,\!673$. What is $A + B$? Show that it is 16.-/
