-- The cube of a two-digit number is 912673. What is the sum of the two digits?

  -- A two-digit number falls in the range from 10 to 99.
  have h2 : 10 * a + b ≥ 10 := by omega
  have h3 : 10 * a + b ≤ 99 := by omega

  -- Since we are cubing a number, we can take cube roots of the bounds.
  have h4 : 10 ≤ 10 * a + b := by omega
  have h5 : 10 * a + b ≤ 99 := by omega

  -- The cube root of 912673 is 97.
  have h6 : 97 ^ 3 = 912673 := by norm_num

  -- So we can say that the two-digit number must be 97.
  have h7 : 10 * a + b = 97 := by
    rw [← h6] at h₁
    rw [Nat.pow_left_injective (by norm_num) h4, h5] at h₁
    exact h₁

  -- And that means the two digits must be 9 and 7.
  have h8 : a = 9 := by omega
  have h9 : b = 7 := by omega

  -- And their sum is 16.
