-- AB is a two-digit number, so $1 \leq A \leq 9$ and $B \leq 9$.
  rcases h₀ with ⟨ha₁, ha₂, hb⟩

  have h₅ : (10 * a + b) ^ 3 ≤ 99 ^ 3 := by

  -- We know that $(AB)^3 = 912673$, so $100^3 \leq 912673 \leq 99^3$.
  rw [h₁] at h₄ h₅

  -- $912673 \leq 99^3$ is true, but $100^3 \leq 912673$ is false. Hence, we get a contradiction.
