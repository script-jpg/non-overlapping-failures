-- We want to prove that if $3a+2b=5$ and $a+b=2$, then $(a,b)=(1,1)$.

  -- The first step is to construct a system of equations that will allow us to solve for $a$ and $b$.
  have eq1 : a + b = 2 := h₁

  -- Let's manipulate the given equations to eliminate one of the variables.
  have eq2 : 3 * a + 2 * b = 5 := h₀

  -- If we multiply the first equation by 2, we get: $2a + 2b = 4$
  have eq3 : 2 * a + 2 * b = 4 := by
    linarith [eq1]

  -- Now, if we subtract this new equation from the second given equation:
  -- $(3a + 2b) - (2a + 2b) = 5 - 4$
  -- We get: $a = 1$
  have ha : a = 1 := by
    linarith [eq2, eq3]

  -- Substitute $a = 1$ back into the first equation: $1 + b = 2$
  have hb : b = 1 := by
    linarith [ha, eq1]

  -- This gives us $b = 1$.
  -- So the ordered pair that satisfies both equations is $(1,1)$.

  -- To complete the proof, we need to combine these results into a conjunction.
  exact ⟨ha, hb⟩
