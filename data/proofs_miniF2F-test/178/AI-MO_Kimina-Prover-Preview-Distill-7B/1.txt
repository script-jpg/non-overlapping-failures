-- We want to prove that if $3a+2b=5$ and $a+b=2$, then $(a,b)=(1,1)$.
  have ha : a = 1 := by
    -- To solve the system of equations, we can first multiply the second equation by 2 to get $2a+2b=4$.
    have h₂ : 2 * a + 2 * b = 4 := by linarith [h₁]
    -- Now, we can subtract this equation from the first equation: $(3a+2b)-(2a+2b)=5-4$.
    have h₃ : a = 1 := by linarith [h₀, h₂]
    -- Therefore, $a=1$.
    exact h₃

  have hb : b = 1 := by
    -- From the second equation $a+b=2$ and $a=1$, we can substitute $a$ with 1 to get $1+b=2$.
    have h₄ : 1 + b = 2 := by linarith [h₁, ha]
    -- Solving for $b$ gives $b=1$.
    linarith

  -- Thus, the ordered pair that satisfies both equations is $(1,1)$.
  exact ⟨ha, hb⟩
