-- We want to prove that if $3a+2b=5$ and $a+b=2$, then $(a,b)=(1,1)$.

  -- Using the two equations $3a+2b=5$ and $a+b=2$, we can solve for $a$ and $b$.
  have ha : a = 1 := by linarith

  -- Substituting $a=1$ into $a+b=2$, we get $1+b=2$, which gives $b=1$.
  have hb : b = 1 := by linarith [h₁, ha]

  -- Therefore, the ordered pair $(a,b)$ that satisfies both equations is indeed $(1,1)$.
  exact ⟨ha, hb⟩
