-- We have two equations: 3a + 2b = 5 and a + b = 2. We need to find the ordered pair (a, b) that satisfies both equations.

  -- From the second equation a + b = 2, we can express b in terms of a: b = 2 - a.

  have hb : b = 2 - a := by linarith

  -- Substitute b = 2 - a into the first equation 3a + 2b = 5.

  rw [hb] at h₀

  -- Now we have 3a + 2(2 - a) = 5. Simplify this equation: 3a + 4 - 2a = 5, which gives a + 4 = 5.

  have ha : a = 1 := by linarith

  -- Substitute a = 1 back into b = 2 - a to find b.

  have hb' : b = 1 := by rw [ha] at hb; linarith

  -- Therefore, the ordered pair that satisfies both equations is (1, 1).
