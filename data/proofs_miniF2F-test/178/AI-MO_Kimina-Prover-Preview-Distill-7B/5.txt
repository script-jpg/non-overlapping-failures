-- We have two equations: 3a + 2b = 5 and a + b = 2
  -- Let's solve these algebraically to find the values of a and b.

  have ha : a = 1 := by
    -- From the second equation, we have a = 2 - b
    have : a = 2 - b := by linarith
    -- Substitute this into the first equation: 3(2 - b) + 2b = 5
    rw [this] at h₀
    -- 3(2 - b) + 2b = 5
    -- 6 - 3b + 2b = 5
    -- 6 - b = 5
    -- So b = 1
    have : b = 1 := by linarith
    -- Substitute b = 1 into a = 2 - b
    rw [this] at *
    -- So a = 2 - 1 = 1
    linarith

  have hb : b = 1 := by
    -- From the equation a + b = 2 and a = 1, we get 1 + b = 2
    rw [ha] at h₁
    -- So b = 1
    linarith

  -- Therefore, the ordered pair that satisfies both equations is (1, 1)
  exact ⟨ha, hb⟩
