-- make a plan to solve the equation
  -- solve by elimination
  -- from h₁ get a = 2 - b
  -- substitute into h₀ 3(2-b) + 2b = 5
  -- simplify to get b = 1
  -- then get a = 2 - b = 1
  -- thus the ordered pair is (1,1)

  -- elimination plan done, start to write tactics
  have h₂ : a = 1 := by
    linarith
  -- linarith can do this, see its manual.
  -- it is powerful to solve linear equations and inequalities
  -- here it solved a = 2 - b from h₁ and substitute into h₀, then it solve 3(2-b) + 2b = 5, so b = 1, then a = 2 - b = 1

  have h₃ : b = 1 := by
    linarith
  -- linarith can also do this. it may use h₁ again, or use other methods
  -- hmmm, if linarith can solve the equation system by itself, then what is the sake of having h₂ and h₃
  -- actually, in the informal plan we need to prove a=1 and b=1 separately, so we name them h₂ and h₃

  exact ⟨h₂, h₃⟩
  -- the final goal is the ordered pair (a,b), which is a = 1 and b = 1, exactly what we have proveed
