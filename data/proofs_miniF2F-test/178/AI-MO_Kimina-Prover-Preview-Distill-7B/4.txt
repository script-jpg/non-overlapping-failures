-- We want to prove that if $3a+2b=5$ and $a+b=2$, then $(a,b)=(1,1)$.
  have h₂ : a = 1 := by
    -- To solve the system of equations, we can first multiply the second equation by 2 to get $2a+2b=4$.
    have h₃ : 2 * a + 2 * b = 4 := by
      linarith [h₁]
    -- Now we can subtract this equation from the first equation: $(3a+2b)-(2a+2b)=5-4$.
    have h₄ : a = 1 := by
      linarith [h₀, h₃]
    -- This simplifies to $a=1$.
    exact h₄
  have h₅ : b = 1 := by
    -- From $a+b=2$ and $a=1$, we can substitute to get $1+b=2$.
    have h₆ : 1 + b = 2 := by
      linarith [h₁, h₂]
    -- Solving for $b$ gives $b=1$.
    linarith [h₆]
  -- Therefore, the ordered pair that satisfies both equations is $(1,1)$.
  exact ⟨h₂, h₅⟩
