-- We want to prove that the only solution to the system of equations is (1,1).
  -- We'll use substitution to solve the system.
  have h2 : a = 2 - b := by linarith
  -- We substituted $a = 2 - b$ into the first equation.
  rw [h2] at h₀
  -- This gives us $3(2-b) + 2b = 5$.
  have h3 : 3 * (2 - b) + 2 * b = 5 := h₀
  -- Simplifying gives $6 - 3b + 2b = 5$.
  have h4 : 6 - 3 * b + 2 * b = 5 := by linarith
  -- This simplifies to $6 - b = 5$.
  have h5 : 6 - b = 5 := by linarith
  -- Solving for $b$ gives $b = 1$.
  have hb : b = 1 := by linarith
  -- Substituting $b = 1$ back into $a = 2 - b$ gives $a = 1$.
  have ha : a = 1 := by linarith
  -- So the only solution is $(a, b) = (1, 1)$.
