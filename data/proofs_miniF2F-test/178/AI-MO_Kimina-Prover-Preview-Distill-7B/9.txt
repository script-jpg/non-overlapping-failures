-- We want to prove that if $3a+2b=5$ and $a+b=2$, then $(a,b) = (1,1)$.

  -- The proof has two parts:
  -- 1. Prove that $a = 1$
  -- 2. Prove that $b = 1$
  constructor

  -- Prove that $a = 1$
  · -- We can prove this by linarith
    linarith

  -- Prove that $b = 1$
  · -- We can prove this by linarith
