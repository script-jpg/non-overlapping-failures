-- We want to prove that if $3a+2b=5$ and $a+b=2$, then $(a,b) = (1,1)$.

  -- The first step is to eliminate one of the variables. We can multiply the second equation by 2 to get $2a+2b=4$.
  have h₂ : 2 * a + 2 * b = 4 := by linarith

  -- Next, we can subtract the new equation from the first equation to get $(3a+2b)-(2a+2b) = 5-4$, which simplifies to $a=1$.
  have h₃ : a = 1 := by linarith

  -- Finally, we can substitute $a=1$ back into the second equation to get $1+b=2$, which gives $b=1$.
  have h₄ : b = 1 := by linarith

  -- Therefore, the ordered pair that satisfies both equations is indeed $(1,1)$.
  exact ⟨h₃, h₄⟩
