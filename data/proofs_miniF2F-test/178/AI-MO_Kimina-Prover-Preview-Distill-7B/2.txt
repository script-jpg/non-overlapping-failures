-- We want to prove that if $3a+2b=5$ and $a+b=2$, then $(a,b) = (1,1)$.

  constructor

  -- Prove that $a = 1$.

  · -- We have $3a + 2b = 5$ and $a + b = 2$. Let's manipulate the first equation.

    have : 3 * a + 2 * (2 - a) = 5 := by rw [← h₁] ; ring     -- Substituting $b = 2 - a$ into the first equation.

    have : a = 1 := by linarith Thomas           -- Solving the resulting equation.

    assumption                                 -- We have just proved that $a = 1$.

  -- Prove that $b = 1$.

  · -- Again, we have $3a + 2b = 5$ and $a + b = 2$. Let's manipulate the second equation.

    have : 3 * (2 - b) + 2 * b = 5 := by rw [← h₁] ; ring     -- Substituting $a = 2 - b$ into the first equation.

    have : b = 1 := by linarith Thomas           -- Solving the resulting equation.

    assumption                                 -- We have just proved that $b = 1$.
