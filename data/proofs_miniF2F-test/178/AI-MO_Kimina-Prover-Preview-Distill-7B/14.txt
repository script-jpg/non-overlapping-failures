-- We want to prove that the only solution to the system of equations is (1,1).
  -- We'll use the `constructor` tactic to split the goal into two subgoals: proving a = 1 and proving b = 1.

  -- We've used `constructor` to split the goal into two subgoals. Now we just need to solve each one.
  -- For the first subgoal (proving a = 1), we can use `linarith` which is powerful for solving linear arithmetic problems.

  -- Similarly, for the second subgoal (proving b = 1), we can also use `linarith`.
