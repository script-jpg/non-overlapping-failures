-- We have two equations: 3a + 2b = 5 and a + b = 2.
  -- We need to find the values of a and b that satisfy both equations.

  -- From the second equation, a + b = 2, we can express b in terms of a: b = 2 - a.
  have hb : b = 2 - a := by linarith

  -- Substitute b = 2 - a into the first equation: 3a + 2(2 - a) = 5.
  rw [hb] at h₀
  -- This simplifies to 3a + 4 - 2a = 5.
  -- Further simplification gives a + 4 = 5.
  -- So a = 1.
  have ha : a = 1 := by linarith

  -- Substitute a = 1 back into b = 2 - a to find b.
  rw [ha] at hb
  -- This gives b = 2 - 1 = 1.
  have hb' : b = 1 := by norm_num at hb; exact hb

  -- Therefore, the ordered pair that satisfies both equations is (1, 1).
  exact ⟨ha, hb'⟩
