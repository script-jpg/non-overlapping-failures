-- We want to prove that the only solution to the system of equations is (1,1).
  -- We have two equations: 3a + 2b = 5 and a + b = 2.

  -- From the second equation, we can express b in terms of a: b = 2 - a.
  have h2 : b = 2 - a := by linarith

  -- Substitute b = 2 - a into the first equation: 3a + 2(2 - a) = 5.
  rw [h2] at h₀
  -- This simplifies to 3a + 4 - 2a = 5, which further simplifies to a + 4 = 5.
  have h3 : a + 4 = 5 := by linarith

  -- Solving a + 4 = 5 gives us a = 1.
  have ha : a = 1 := by linarith

  -- Substitute a = 1 into b = 2 - a to find b.
  rw [ha] at h2
  -- This gives us b = 2 - 1 = 1.
  have hb : b = 1 := by linarith

  -- Therefore, the ordered pair that satisfies both equations is (1,1).
  exact ⟨ha, hb⟩
