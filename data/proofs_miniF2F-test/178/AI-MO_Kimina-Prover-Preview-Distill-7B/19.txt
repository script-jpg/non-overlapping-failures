-- We want to prove that if $3a+2b=5$ and $a+b=2$, then $(a,b) = (1,1)$.

  -- Prove that $a = 1$.
  · -- We have $3a+2b=5$ and $a+b=2$. We can solve for $a$ by eliminating $b$.
    -- Multiply the second equation by 2 to get $2a+2b=4$.
    have h₂ : 2 * a + 2 * b = 4 := by linarith
    -- Subtract the new equation from the first equation to get $a = 1$.
    have h₃ : a = 1 := by linarith
    exact h₃

  -- Prove that $b = 1$.
  · -- We have $3a+2b=5$ and $a+b=2$. We can solve for $b$ by eliminating $a$.
    -- Multiply the second equation by 3 to get $3a+3b=6$.
    have h₂ : 3 * a + 3 * b = 6 := by linarith
    -- Subtract the new equation from the first equation to get $b = -1$.
    have h₃ : b = -1 := by linarith
    -- But this is impossible because $a+b=2$ and $a$ would have to be $3$.
