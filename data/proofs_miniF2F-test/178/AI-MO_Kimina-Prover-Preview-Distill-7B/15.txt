-- We want to prove that the only solution to the system of equations is (1,1).
  -- First, we will try to solve the system algebraically.
  -- We have:
  -- 3a + 2b = 5
  -- a + b = 2
  --
  -- From the second equation, we have b = 2 - a
  have : b = 2 - a := by linarith
  rw [this] at h₀
  -- Now we have 3a + 2(2-a) = 5
  -- Simplifying: 3a + 4 - 2a = 5
  -- So a + 4 = 5
  -- So a = 1
  have : a = 1 := by linarith
  rw [this] at this
  -- Substituting a = 1 into b = 2 - a, we get b = 2 - 1 = 1
  have : b = 1 := by linarith
  -- Therefore, the only solution is (a,b) = (1,1)
  exact ⟨this, ‹b = 1›⟩
