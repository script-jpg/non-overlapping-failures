  · -- First, we'll prove that $a=1$.
    -- We can multiply the second equation by 2 to get $2a+2b=4$. Then, subtracting this from the first equation, we get $(3a+2b)-(2a+2b)=5-4$, which simplifies to $a=1$.

  · -- Now, we'll prove that $b=1$.
    -- We can substitute $a=1$ into the second equation to get $1+b=2$, which implies $b=1$.
