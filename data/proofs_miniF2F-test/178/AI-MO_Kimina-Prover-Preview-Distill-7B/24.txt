-- We have two equations: 3a + 2b = 5 and a + b = 2.
  -- We need to find the ordered pair (a, b) that satisfies both equations.

  -- From the second equation a + b = 2, we get b = 2 - a.
  have r : b = 2 - a := by linarith

  -- Substitute b = 2 - a into the first equation 3a + 2b = 5:
  -- 3a + 2(2 - a) = 5
  -- 3a + 4 - 2a = 5
  -- a + 4 = 5
  -- a = 1
  have r' : a = 1 := by linarith only [h₀, h₁]

  -- Now that we have a = 1, substitute back into b = 2 - a to find b:
  -- b = 2 - 1 = 1
  have r'' : b = 1 := by linarith only [r, r']

  -- Therefore, the ordered pair that satisfies both equations is (1, 1).
