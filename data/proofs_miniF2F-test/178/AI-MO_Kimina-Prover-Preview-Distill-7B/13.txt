-- We want to prove that if $3a+2b=5$ and $a+b=2$, then $(a,b)=(1,1)$.

  -- Let's first eliminate one of the variables. We can multiply the second equation by 2 to align the coefficients of $b$:
  -- $2(a+b)=2(2) \implies 2a+2b=4$.
  have h₂ : 2 * a + 2 * b = 4 := by linarith [h₁]

  -- Now subtract this new equation from the first equation:
  -- $(3a+2b)-(2a+2b)=5-4 \implies a=1$.
  have h₃ : a = 1 := by linarith [h₀, h₂]

  -- Substitute $a=1$ back into the second original equation:
  -- $1+b=2 \implies b=1$.
  have h₄ : b = 1 := by linarith [h₁, h₃]

  -- Therefore, the ordered pair that satisfies both equations is $(1,1)$.
  exact ⟨h₃, h₄⟩
