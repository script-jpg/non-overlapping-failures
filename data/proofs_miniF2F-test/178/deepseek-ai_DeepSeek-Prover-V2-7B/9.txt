have h₂ : a = 1 := by
    -- We use the given equations to solve for `a` and `b`.
    -- First, we express `b` in terms of `a` from the second equation.
    have : a = 1 := by
      -- Using the second equation, we solve for `a`.
      linarith
    -- We have `a = 1`.
    exact this
  have h₃ : b = 1 := by
    -- We substitute `a = 1` into the second equation to find `b`.
    have : b = 1 := by
      -- Using the second equation, we solve for `b`.
      linarith
    -- We have `b = 1`.
    exact this
  -- We construct the final answer with the values of `a` and `b`.
