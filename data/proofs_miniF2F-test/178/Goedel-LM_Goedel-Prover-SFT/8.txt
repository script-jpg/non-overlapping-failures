  Given the system of linear equations:
  1. \( 3a + 2b = 5 \)
  2. \( a + b = 2 \)
  We need to find the ordered pair \((a, b)\) that satisfies both equations and show that it is \((1, 1)\).
  First, we solve the second equation for \(b\):
  \[ b = 2 - a \]
  Next, substitute \(b = 2 - a\) into the first equation:
  \[ 3a + 2(2 - a) = 5 \]
  Simplify and solve for \(a\):
  \[ 3a + 4 - 2a = 5 \]
  \[ a + 4 = 5 \]
  \[ a = 1 \]
  Now, substitute \(a = 1\) back into \(b = 2 - a\):
  \[ b = 2 - 1 \]
  \[ b = 1 \]
  Thus, the ordered pair \((a, b)\) is \((1, 1)\).
