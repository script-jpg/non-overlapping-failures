  Given the equations \(3a + 2b = 5\) and \(a + b = 2\), we need to find the ordered pair \((a, b)\) that satisfies both equations. We will show that this pair is \((1, 1)\).
  1. Start by isolating \(a\) in the second equation \(a + b = 2\).
  2. Substitute \(b = 2 - a\) into the first equation \(3a + 2b = 5\).
  3. Simplify the resulting equation to solve for \(a\).
  4. Once \(a\) is found, substitute it back into the second equation to find \(b\).
  5. Verify that the solution \((a, b) = (1, 1)\) satisfies both original equations.

  -- Isolate `a` in the second equation to get `b = 2 - a`.
  have h₂ : a = 1 := by
    -- Substitute `b = 2 - a` into the first equation and simplify.
    -- This step involves algebraic manipulation to solve for `a`.
    linarith
  -- Substitute `a = 1` back into the second equation to find `b`.
  have h₃ : b = 1 := by
    -- This step involves substituting `a = 1` into the equation `a + b = 2`.
    linarith
  -- Combine the results to conclude that `a = 1` and `b = 1`.
