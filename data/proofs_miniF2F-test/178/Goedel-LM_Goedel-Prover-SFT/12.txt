  Given the equations \(3a + 2b = 5\) and \(a + b = 2\), we need to find the ordered pair \((a, b)\) that satisfies both equations. We will show that the solution is \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\).
  1. Start with the given equations:
     \[
     3a + 2b = 5 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
     \]
     \[
     a + b = 2 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
     \]
  2. To eliminate one of the variables, multiply Equation 2 by 2:
     \[
     2(a + b) = 2 \cdot 2 \implies 2a + 2b = 4
     \]
  3. Subtract Equation 1 from this result:
     \[
     (2a + 2b) - (3a + 2b) = 4 - 5 \implies 2a + 2b - 3a - 2b = -1 \implies -a = -1 \implies a = 1
     \]
  4. Substitute \(a = 1\) back into Equation 2:
     \[
     1 + b = 2 \implies b = 1
     \]
  5. Therefore, the ordered pair \((a, b)\) that satisfies both equations is \((1, 1)\).
