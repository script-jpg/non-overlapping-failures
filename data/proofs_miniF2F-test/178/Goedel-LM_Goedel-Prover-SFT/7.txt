  Given the equations \(3a + 2b = 5\) and \(a + b = 2\), we need to find the ordered pair \((a, b)\) that satisfies both equations. We will show that this pair is \((1, 1)\).
  1. Start by isolating \(a\) in terms of \(b\) using the second equation: \(a = 2 - b\).
  2. Substitute \(a = 2 - b\) into the first equation: \(3(2 - b) + 2b = 5\).
  3. Simplify the equation: \(6 - 3b + 2b = 5\), which reduces to \(6 - b = 5\).
  4. Solve for \(b\): \(b = 1\).
  5. Substitute \(b = 1\) back into the expression for \(a\): \(a = 2 - 1 = 1\).
  Thus, the ordered pair \((a, b)\) is \((1, 1)\).

  case left =>
    -- Isolate a in terms of b using the second equation: a = 2 - b
    have := congr_arg (· / 3) h₁
    -- This gives us a/3 = (2 - b)/3
    simp at this
    -- Simplify the equation to isolate a
    linarith
  case right =>
    -- Substitute a = 2 - b into the first equation and solve for b
    have := congr_arg (· / 2) h₁
    -- This gives us (a + b)/2 = 1
    simp at this
    -- Simplify the equation to isolate b
