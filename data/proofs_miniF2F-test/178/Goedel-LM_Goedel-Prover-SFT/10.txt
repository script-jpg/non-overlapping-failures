  Given the equations \(3a + 2b = 5\) and \(a + b = 2\), we need to find the ordered pair \((a, b)\) that satisfies both equations. We will show that the solution is \((1, 1)\).
  1. From the equation \(a + b = 2\), we can express \(b\) as \(b = 2 - a\).
  2. Substitute \(b = 2 - a\) into the first equation \(3a + 2b = 5\):
     \[
     3a + 2(2 - a) = 5
     \]
  3. Simplify the equation:
     \[
     3a + 4 - 2a = 5
     \]
     \[
     a + 4 = 5
     \]
     \[
     a = 1
     \]
  4. Substitute \(a = 1\) back into \(b = 2 - a\):
     \[
     b = 2 - 1 = 1
     \]
  5. Therefore, the ordered pair is \((a, b) = (1, 1)\).
