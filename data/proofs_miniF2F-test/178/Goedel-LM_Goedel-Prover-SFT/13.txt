  Given the equations \(3a + 2b = 5\) and \(a + b = 2\), we need to find the ordered pair \((a, b)\) that satisfies both equations. We will show that this pair is \((1, 1)\).
  1. From the equation \(a + b = 2\), we can express \(b\) as \(b = 2 - a\).
  2. Substitute \(b = 2 - a\) into the first equation \(3a + 2b = 5\):
     \[
     3a + 2(2 - a) = 5
     \]
  3. Simplify the equation:
     \[
     3a + 4 - 2a = 5 \implies a + 4 = 5 \implies a = 1
     \]
  4. Substitute \(a = 1\) back into \(b = 2 - a\):
     \[
     b = 2 - 1 = 1
     \]
  5. Therefore, the ordered pair \((a, b)\) is \((1, 1)\).

  -- From the second equation, express b in terms of a: b = 2 - a
  have b_eq : b = 2 - a := by linarith
  -- Substitute b = 2 - a into the first equation: 3a + 2(2 - a) = 5
  simp only [b_eq] at h₀
  -- Simplify the equation: 3a + 4 - 2a = 5 ⟹ a + 4 = 5 ⟹ a = 1
  have a_eq : a = 1 := by linarith
  -- Substitute a = 1 back into b = 2 - a: b = 2 - 1 = 1
  have b_eq : b = 1 := by linarith
  -- Combine the results to get the final answer
