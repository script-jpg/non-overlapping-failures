  Given the equations \(3a + 2b = 5\) and \(a + b = 2\), we need to find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) that satisfy both equations. We will show that \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\) satisfy both equations.
  First, we multiply the second equation \(a + b = 2\) by 2 to get \(2a + 2b = 4\). We then subtract this new equation from the first equation \(3a + 2b = 5\):
  \[
  (3a + 2b) - (2a + 2b) = 5 - 4
  \]
  Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:
  \[
  3a + 2b - 2a - 2b = a
  \]
  Thus, we have:
  \[
  a = 1
  \]
  Next, we substitute \(a = 1\) back into the second equation \(a + b = 2\):
  \[
  1 + b = 2
  \]
  Solving for \(b\), we find:
  \[
  b = 1
  \]
  Therefore, the ordered pair \((a, b)\) that satisfies both equations is \((1, 1)\).

  -- We start by multiplying the second equation by 2 to align the coefficients of b.
  have h₂ : 2 * (a + b) = 2 * 2 := by rw [h₁]
  -- Simplify the equation to get 2a + 2b = 4.
  have h₃ : 2 * a + 2 * b = 4 := by linarith
  -- Subtract the new equation from the first equation to eliminate b.
  have h₄ : (3 * a + 2 * b) - (2 * a + 2 * b) = 5 - 4 := by rw [h₀, h₃]
  -- Simplify the left-hand side to get a = 1.
  have h₅ : a = 1 := by linarith
  -- Substitute a = 1 back into the second equation to solve for b.
  have h₆ : 1 + b = 2 := by rw [h₅] at h₁; exact h₁
  -- Solve for b to get b = 1.
  have h₇ : b = 1 := by linarith
  -- Combine the results to conclude a = 1 and b = 1.
