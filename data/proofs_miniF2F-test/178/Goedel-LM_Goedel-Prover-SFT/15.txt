  Given the equations \(3a + 2b = 5\) and \(a + b = 2\), we need to find the ordered pair \((a, b)\) that satisfies both equations. We will show that this pair is \((1, 1)\).
  1. Start by expressing \(a\) in terms of \(b\) using the second equation: \(a = 2 - b\).
  2. Substitute \(a = 2 - b\) into the first equation: \(3(2 - b) + 2b = 5\).
  3. Simplify the equation: \(6 - 3b + 2b = 5\), which reduces to \(6 - b = 5\).
  4. Solve for \(b\): \(b = 1\).
  5. Substitute \(b = 1\) back into \(a = 2 - b\) to find \(a\): \(a = 2 - 1 = 1\).
  Thus, the ordered pair \((a, b)\) that satisfies both equations is \((1, 1)\).

  -- Express a in terms of b using the second equation.
  have a_eq : a = 2 - b := by linarith
  -- Substitute a = 2 - b into the first equation and solve for b.
  have b_eq : b = 1 := by linarith
  -- Substitute b = 1 back into a = 2 - b to find a.
  have a_eq_1 : a = 1 := by linarith
  -- Construct the final result using the derived values of a and b.
