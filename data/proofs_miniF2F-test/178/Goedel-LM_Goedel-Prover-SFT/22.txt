  Given the equations \(3a + 2b = 5\) and \(a + b = 2\), we need to find the ordered pair \((a, b)\) that satisfies both equations. We will show that this pair is \((1, 1)\).
  First, we express \(b\) in terms of \(a\) using the second equation:
  \[ b = 2 - a \]
  Next, we substitute \(b = 2 - a\) into the first equation:
  \[ 3a + 2(2 - a) = 5 \]
  Simplifying this equation:
  \[ 3a + 4 - 2a = 5 \]
  \[ a + 4 = 5 \]
  \[ a = 1 \]
  Now, substituting \(a = 1\) back into the expression for \(b\):
  \[ b = 2 - 1 \]
  \[ b = 1 \]
  Thus, the solution to the system of equations is \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\).
