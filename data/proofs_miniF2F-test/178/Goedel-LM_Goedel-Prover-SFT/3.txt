  Given the equations \(3a + 2b = 5\) and \(a + b = 2\), we need to find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) that satisfy both equations. We will show that \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\).
  1. Start with the second equation \(a + b = 2\).
  2. Solve for \(b\) in terms of \(a\): \(b = 2 - a\).
  3. Substitute \(b = 2 - a\) into the first equation \(3a + 2b = 5\):
     \[
     3a + 2(2 - a) = 5
     \]
  4. Simplify the equation:
     \[
     3a + 4 - 2a = 5 \implies a + 4 = 5 \implies a = 1
     \]
  5. Substitute \(a = 1\) back into \(b = 2 - a\):
     \[
     b = 2 - 1 = 1
     \]
  6. Verify that \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\) satisfy both original equations:
     \[
     3(1) + 2(1) = 5 \quad \text{and} \quad 1 + 1 = 2
     \]
  Thus, the ordered pair \((a, b)\) that satisfies both equations is \((1, 1)\).
