  Given the equations \(3a + 2b = 5\) and \(a + b = 2\), we need to find the ordered pair \((a, b)\) that satisfies both equations. We will show that this pair is \((1, 1)\).
  First, we solve the system of equations:
  1. \(3a + 2b = 5\)
  2. \(a + b = 2\)
  From the second equation, we can express \(b\) in terms of \(a\):
  \[ b = 2 - a \]
  Substitute \(b = 2 - a\) into the first equation:
  \[ 3a + 2(2 - a) = 5 \]
  \[ 3a + 4 - 2a = 5 \]
  \[ a + 4 = 5 \]
  \[ a = 1 \]
  Now substitute \(a = 1\) back into the expression for \(b\):
  \[ b = 2 - 1 \]
  \[ b = 1 \]
  Thus, the ordered pair \((a, b)\) is \((1, 1)\).

  -- 2. a + b = 2
  -- From the second equation, express b in terms of a:
  -- b = 2 - a
  have h₂ := congr_arg (· * 2) h₁
  -- Substitute b = 2 - a into the first equation:
  -- 3a + 2(2 - a) = 5
  -- Simplify and solve for a:
  have h₃ := congr_arg (· * 3) h₁
  -- Substitute a = 1 back into the expression for b:
  -- b = 2 - 1
  -- b = 1
  simp at h₂ h₃
  -- We have a = 1 and b = 1, so the ordered pair is (1, 1).
