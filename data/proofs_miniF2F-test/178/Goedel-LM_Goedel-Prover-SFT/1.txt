  Given the equations \(3a + 2b = 5\) and \(a + b = 2\), we need to find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) that satisfy both equations. We will show that the only solution to this system of equations is \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\).
  1. Start with the second equation \(a + b = 2\).
  2. Express \(a\) in terms of \(b\) as \(a = 2 - b\).
  3. Substitute \(a = 2 - b\) into the first equation \(3a + 2b = 5\).
  4. Simplify the resulting equation to solve for \(b\).
  5. Once \(b\) is determined, substitute it back to find \(a\).
  6. Verify that the solution \(a = 1\) and \(b = 1\) satisfies both original equations.

  -- We start by solving the second equation for a.
  have : a = 1 := by
    -- Express a in terms of b using the second equation.
    have : a = 2 - b := by linarith
    -- Substitute a = 2 - b into the first equation.

    -- Simplify the equation to solve for b.
    -- The equation becomes 3(2 - b) + 2b = 5, which simplifies to 6 - 3b + 2b = 5.
    -- Further simplify to get b = 1.

  -- Now that we have a = 1, we substitute back into the second equation to find b.
  have : b = 1 := by
    -- Substitute a = 1 into a + b = 2.

    -- Simplify the equation to solve for b.
    -- The equation becomes 1 + b = 2, which simplifies to b = 1.
