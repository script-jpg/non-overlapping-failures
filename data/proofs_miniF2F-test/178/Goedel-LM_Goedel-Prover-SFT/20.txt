  Given the equations \(3a + 2b = 5\) and \(a + b = 2\), we need to find the ordered pair \((a, b)\) that satisfies both equations. We will show that this pair is \((1, 1)\).
  1. Start by expressing \(a\) in terms of \(b\) using the second equation: \(a = 2 - b\).
  2. Substitute \(a = 2 - b\) into the first equation: \(3(2 - b) + 2b = 5\).
  3. Simplify the equation: \(6 - 3b + 2b = 5\), which reduces to \(6 - b = 5\).
  4. Solve for \(b\): \(b = 1\).
  5. Substitute \(b = 1\) back into \(a = 2 - b\): \(a = 2 - 1 = 1\).
  Thus, the ordered pair \((a, b)\) that satisfies both equations is \((1, 1)\).
