  Given the equations \(3a + 2b = 5\) and \(a + b = 2\), we need to find the ordered pair \((a, b)\) that satisfies both equations. We will show that this pair is \((1, 1)\).
  1. Start with the second equation: \(a + b = 2\).
  2. Solve for \(b\) in terms of \(a\): \(b = 2 - a\).
  3. Substitute \(b = 2 - a\) into the first equation: \(3a + 2(2 - a) = 5\).
  4. Simplify the equation: \(3a + 4 - 2a = 5\).
  5. Combine like terms: \(a + 4 = 5\).
  6. Solve for \(a\): \(a = 1\).
  7. Substitute \(a = 1\) back into \(b = 2 - a\): \(b = 2 - 1 = 1\).
  Thus, the ordered pair \((a, b)\) that satisfies both equations is \((1, 1)\).
