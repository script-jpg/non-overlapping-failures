  Given the equations \(3a + 2b = 5\) and \(a + b = 2\), we need to find the ordered pair \((a, b)\) that satisfies both equations. We will show that the solution is \((1, 1)\).
  1. Start with the given equations:
     \[
     3a + 2b = 5 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
     \]
     \[
     a + b = 2 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
     \]
  2. Solve Equation 2 for \(b\):
     \[
     b = 2 - a \quad \text{(Equation 3)}
     \]
  3. Substitute \(b = 2 - a\) into Equation 1:
     \[
     3a + 2(2 - a) = 5
     \]
  4. Simplify the equation:
     \[
     3a + 4 - 2a = 5
     \]
     \[
     a + 4 = 5
     \]
     \[
     a = 1
     \]
  5. Substitute \(a = 1\) back into Equation 2 to find \(b\):
     \[
     1 + b = 2
     \]
     \[
     b = 1
     \]
  6. Therefore, the ordered pair \((a, b)\) that satisfies both equations is \((1, 1)\).
