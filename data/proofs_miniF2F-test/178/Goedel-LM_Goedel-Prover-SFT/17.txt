  Given the equations \(3a + 2b = 5\) and \(a + b = 2\), we need to find the ordered pair \((a, b)\) that satisfies both equations. We start by solving the second equation for \(b\), which gives \(b = 2 - a\). Substituting this expression for \(b\) into the first equation, we obtain \(3a + 2(2 - a) = 5\). Simplifying this equation, we get \(3a + 4 - 2a = 5\), which further simplifies to \(a + 4 = 5\). Solving for \(a\), we find \(a = 1\). Substituting \(a = 1\) back into the expression for \(b\), we get \(b = 2 - 1 = 1\). Therefore, the ordered pair \((a, b)\) that satisfies both equations is \((1, 1)\).

  -- Solve the second equation for b to get b = 2 - a
  have b_val : b = 2 - a := by linarith
  -- Substitute b = 2 - a into the first equation
  rw [b_val] at h₀
  -- Simplify the resulting equation to solve for a
  have a_eq : 3 * a + 2 * (2 - a) = 5 := by linarith
  have a_eq_2 : a = 1 := by linarith
  -- Substitute a = 1 back into the expression for b
  have b_eq_2 : b = 1 := by linarith
  -- Combine the results to get the final answer
  exact ⟨a_eq_2, b_eq_2⟩
