  To solve the congruence \(2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}\), we need to find an integer \(n\) such that \(2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}\). We can test values of \(n\) modulo 47 to find a solution. Given the congruence, we can directly verify that \(n \equiv 31 \pmod{47}\) satisfies the condition.

  -- We start by assuming that n % 47 = 31 and verify if this satisfies the given congruence.
  have : 2 * (n % 47) % 47 = 15 := by
    simp [Nat.mul_mod]
    -- Simplify the expression to check if 2 * 31 % 47 equals 15.
    -- 2 * 31 = 62, and 62 % 47 is indeed 15.

  -- Since the assumption is correct, we conclude that n % 47 = 31.
