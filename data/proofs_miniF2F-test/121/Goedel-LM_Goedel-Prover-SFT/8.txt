  To solve the congruence \(2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}\), we need to find the value of \(n\) modulo 47. Given that \(2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}\), we can multiply both sides by the modular inverse of 2 modulo 47, which is 23 (since \(2 \times 23 \equiv 1 \pmod{47}\)). Thus, we have:
  \[
  n \equiv 15 \times 23 \pmod{47}
  \]
  Calculating \(15 \times 23\):
  \[
  15 \times 23 = 345
  \]
  Reducing 345 modulo 47:
  \[
  345 \div 47 = 7 \text{ remainder } 31 \implies 345 \equiv 31 \pmod{47}
  \]
  Therefore, \(n \equiv 31 \pmod{47}\).

  -- We know that 2 * n % 47 = 15 from the given hypothesis.
  have : 2 * n % 47 = 15 := h₀
  -- We use the fact that 2 * 23 % 47 = 1 to manipulate the expression.
  have : 2 * 23 % 47 = 1 := by norm_num
  -- We use the omega tactic to solve the linear congruence problem.
