  To solve the congruence \(2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}\), we need to find an integer \(n\) such that \(2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}\). We can express this congruence as \(2n = 47k + 15\) for some integer \(k\). We can simplify this to \(2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}\).
  First, we solve for \(n\) modulo 47. We know that \(2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}\). To isolate \(n\), we can multiply both sides by the modular inverse of 2 modulo 47. The modular inverse of 2 modulo 47 is 23, because \(2 \times 23 \equiv 1 \pmod{47}\).
  Multiplying both sides of the congruence \(2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}\) by 23, we get:
  \[ 23 \times 2n \equiv 23 \times 15 \pmod{47} \]
  \[ 46n \equiv 345 \pmod{47} \]
  Since \(46 \equiv -1 \pmod{47}\), we can simplify this to:
  \[ -n \equiv 345 \pmod{47} \]
  \[ n \equiv -345 \pmod{47} \]
  \[ n \equiv 12 \pmod{47} \]
  However, we need to find \(n\) such that \(2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}\). We can see that \(n = 31\) satisfies this congruence because:
  \[ 2 \times 31 = 62 \]
  \[ 62 \equiv 15 \pmod{47} \]
  Thus, the solution to the congruence \(2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}\) is \(n \equiv 31 \pmod{47}\).
