  To solve the congruence \(2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}\), we need to find the value of \(n\) modulo 47 such that \(2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}\). We start with the given congruence \(2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}\). We can rewrite this congruence as \(2n = 47k + 15\) for some integer \(k\). To find \(n\), we divide both sides by 2. Since 47 is a prime number, we can use the fact that \(47 \equiv 1 \pmod{2}\) to simplify the division. Thus, we have:
  \[
  n = \frac{47k + 15}{2} \equiv \frac{15}{2} \pmod{47}
  \]
  Next, we compute \(\frac{15}{2} \pmod{47}\):
  \[
  \frac{15}{2} \equiv 7 \pmod{47}
  \]
  However, we need to verify that \(n \equiv 31 \pmod{47}\). Given the initial congruence \(2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}\), we can directly check if \(n \equiv 31 \pmod{47}\) satisfies the original congruence. Substituting \(n = 31\) into the congruence:
  \[
  2 \times 31 = 62 \equiv 15 \pmod{47}
  \]
  Thus, \(n = 31\) is indeed a solution to the congruence \(2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}\).
