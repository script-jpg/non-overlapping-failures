  To solve the congruence \(2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}\), we need to find an integer \(n\) such that \(2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}\). We can rewrite this congruence as:
  \[ 2n = 47k + 15 \]
  for some integer \(k\). We need to find \(n\) such that \(2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}\).
  First, we isolate \(n\) in the congruence:
  \[ 2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47} \]
  Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
  \[ n \equiv \frac{15}{2} \pmod{47} \]
  Since \(\frac{15}{2} = 7.5\), we need to find \(n\) such that:
  \[ n \equiv 7.5 \pmod{47} \]
  However, \(n\) must be an integer. We can express \(n\) as:
  \[ n = 47m + 7 \]
  for some integer \(m\). Substituting \(n\) into the congruence, we get:
  \[ 2(47m + 7) \equiv 15 \pmod{47} \]
  \[ 2 \cdot 47m + 14 \equiv 15 \pmod{47} \]
  \[ 14 \equiv 15 \pmod{47} \]
  This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate our approach. Instead, we can use the fact that \(2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}\) directly to find \(n\).
  We can use the fact that \(2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}\) implies:
  \[ 2n = 47k + 15 \]
  for some integer \(k\). We can solve for \(n\) by finding the multiplicative inverse of 2 modulo 47, which is 24 (since \(2 \cdot 24 \equiv 1 \pmod{47}\)). Multiplying both sides of the congruence by 24, we get:
  \[ n = 47k + 15 \cdot 24 \]
  \[ n = 47k + 360 \]
  Since \(n \equiv 360 \pmod{47}\), and \(360 \equiv 31 \pmod{47}\), we have:
  \[ n \equiv 31 \pmod{47} \]
  Thus, the solution is \(n \equiv 31 \pmod{47}\).
