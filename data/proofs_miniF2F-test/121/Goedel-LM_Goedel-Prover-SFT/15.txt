  To solve the congruence \(2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}\), we need to find an integer \(n\) such that \(2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}\). This can be rewritten as finding \(n\) such that \(2n = 47k + 15\) for some integer \(k\). We can solve this by finding the multiplicative inverse of 2 modulo 47 and then multiplying both sides of the congruence by this inverse.
  Given that \(2 \times 31 \equiv 1 \pmod{47}\), the inverse of 2 modulo 47 is 31. Multiplying both sides of \(2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}\) by 31, we get:
  \[
  31 \times 2n \equiv 31 \times 15 \pmod{47}
  \]
  Simplifying the right-hand side, we have:
  \[
  31 \times 2n \equiv 465 \pmod{47}
  \]
  Since \(465 \equiv 31 \pmod{47}\), we have:
  \[
  31 \times 2n \equiv 31 \pmod{47}
  \]
  Thus, \(n \equiv 31 \pmod{47}\).
