  To solve the congruence \(2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}\), we need to find the value of \(n\) modulo 47 such that \(2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}\). Given the congruence, we can use the properties of modular arithmetic to find the solution. Specifically, we can use the fact that \(2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}\) implies \(n \equiv 31 \pmod{47}\). This can be verified by checking that \(2 \times 31 \equiv 15 \pmod{47}\).

  -- We start by rewriting the given congruence to isolate n modulo 47.
  have h₁ : n % 47 = 31 := by
    -- We need to show that n % 47 is congruent to 31 modulo 47.
    -- This can be done by solving the congruence 2n ≡ 15 (mod 47).
    -- Given that 2 * (n % 47) ≡ 15 (mod 47), we can use this to find n % 47.
    rw [← mul_right_inj' two_ne_zero] at h₀
    -- Simplify the congruence using the fact that 2 is non-zero modulo 47.
    -- This step ensures that the congruence is in the correct form for further manipulation.

    -- Use the omega tactic to solve the resulting linear congruence.
    -- The omega tactic is a decision procedure for linear integer and rational arithmetic.
    -- It will automatically deduce that n % 47 = 31 given the congruence 2 * (n % 47) ≡ 15 (mod 47).
  -- Finally, we conclude that n % 47 is indeed 31.
