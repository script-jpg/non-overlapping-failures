  To solve the congruence \(2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}\), we need to find an integer \(n\) such that \(2n - 15\) is divisible by 47. We can express this as:
  \[ 2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47} \]
  This implies:
  \[ 2n = 47k + 15 \]
  for some integer \(k\). We can solve for \(n\) by isolating it:
  \[ n = \frac{47k + 15}{2} \]
  To ensure \(n\) is an integer, \(47k + 15\) must be even. Since 47 is odd, \(47k\) is also odd, and adding 15 (which is even) to an odd number results in an odd number. Therefore, \(n\) must be an integer, and we need to find \(n \mod 47\).
  Given the congruence \(2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}\), we can use the properties of modular arithmetic to simplify the solution. We know that \(2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}\) implies \(n \equiv 31 \pmod{47}\). This can be verified by checking that \(2 \times 31 \equiv 15 \pmod{47}\).
