-- to solve the congruence $2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}$, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 2 modulo 47.
  -- we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find integers x and y such that 2x + 47y = 1.
  have h1 : 2 * 23 % 47 = 1 := by decide
  -- thus, the multiplicative inverse of 2 modulo 47 is 23.
  -- multiply both sides of the congruence $2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}$ by 23, we get $n \equiv 15 \times 23 \pmod{47}$.
  have h2 : 15 * 23 % 47 = 31 := by decide
  -- so n ≡ 31 (mod 47), and the answer is 31.
  have h3 : 2 * n % 47 = 15 := h₀
  have : n % 47 = 31 := by
