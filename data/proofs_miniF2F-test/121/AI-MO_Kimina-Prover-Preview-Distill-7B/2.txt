-- Because $2$ and $47$ are coprime, this congruence has a unique solution. As $31$ is easily verified to be a solution, it must be the answer.

  have : n % 47 = 31 := by

    -- The key fact is that $2$ and $47$ are coprime, or, equivalently, $2$ is a unit modulo $47$.
    have : 2 * n % 47 = 15 := h₀
    have : n % 47 = 31 := by

      -- The solution can be obtained by multiplying both sides of the congruence by $24$, which is the inverse of $2$ modulo $47$.
