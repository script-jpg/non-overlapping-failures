The key insight is that to solve the congruence $2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}$, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 2 modulo 47. Since 47 is a prime number, every non-zero element in $\mathbb{Z}_{47}$ has an inverse. We can find the inverse of 2 by testing values or using the extended Euclidean algorithm. 

By inspection, we notice that $2 \cdot 31 = 62$ and $62 \equiv 15 \pmod{47}$, which means $2 \cdot 31 \equiv 15 \pmod{47}$. Therefore, the inverse of 2 modulo 47 is 31. 

Now, we can multiply both sides of the congruence $2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}$ by 31 to isolate $n$:
$31 \cdot 2n \equiv 31 \cdot 15 \pmod{47}$
$n \equiv 465 \pmod{47}$

When we divide 465 by 47, we get $465 = 47 \cdot 9 + 31$, so $465 \equiv 31 \pmod{47}$. 

Therefore, $n \equiv 31 \pmod{47}$, and the solution is $n = 31$ within the range 0 to 46.
