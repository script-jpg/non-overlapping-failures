-- Because $2$ and $47$ are coprime, this congruence has a unique solution. As $31$ is easily verified to be a solution, it must be the unique solution.

The theorem states that if $2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}$, then $n \equiv 31 \pmod{47}$. The proof uses the `omega` tactic, which is powerful for solving integer arithmetic goals. It automatically handles the modular arithmetic by converting the congruence relation into an equivalent form that can be solved using linear arithmetic.

To understand why $n = 31$ is the solution, we can check:
$2 \cdot 31 = 62$
$62 \div 47 = 1$ remainder $15$
So $62 \equiv 15 \pmod{47}$, which means $2 \cdot 31 \equiv 15 \pmod{47}$.

Since 2 and 47 are coprime, the solution is unique modulo 47. Therefore, 31 is the only solution in the range from 0 to 46.
