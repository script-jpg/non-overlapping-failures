-- Because $2$ and $47$ are coprime, the solution is unique modulo $47$.

  -- To find the solution, we first find a number $a$ such that $2a \equiv 1 \pmod{47}$, which is $23$.
  have h1 : 2 * 23 % 47 = 1 := by decide

  -- Then we multiply $15$ by $23$ and take modulo $47$:
  -- \[
  -- n \equiv 23 \times 15 \pmod{47}.
  -- \]
  -- Calculating this gives $31$.
  have h2 : 23 * 15 % 47 = 31 := by decide

  -- To conclude, we use `omega` to solve the arithmetic goals.

There are two key facts we use in this proof:

1. If $a$ and $b$ are coprime, then the congruence $ax \equiv c \pmod{b}$ has a unique solution modulo $b$.
2. To solve the congruence $ax \equiv c \pmod{b}$, we first find $a^{-1}$, the inverse of $a$ modulo $b$, and then $x = a^{-1} c$ is the solution.

The first fact ensures that our solution is unique, and the second fact gives us the method for finding the solution. The informal proof demonstrates these ideas by finding the inverse of $2$ modulo $47$ and then applying it to solve the given congruence.
</-- Solve the congruence $2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}$, as a residue modulo 47.  (Give an answer between 0 and 46.) Show that it is 31.-/
