-- -- First, we need to understand what we're calculating.
  -- The sum of divisors of a number $n = p_1^{k_1} \cdot p_2^{k_2} \cdot \ldots \cdot p_m^{k_m}$ is given by:
  -- $$\sigma(n) = (1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \ldots + p_1^{k_1})(1 + p_2 + p_2^2 + \ldots + p_2^{k_2}) \ldots (1 + p_m + p_m^2 + \ldots + p_m^{k_m})$$
  -- For $500 = 2^2 \cdot 5^3$, we have:
  -- $$\sigma(500) = (1 + 2 + 2^2)(1 + 5 + 5^2 + 5^3) = 7 \cdot 156 = 1092$$

  have h₁ : a = 1092 := by decide

  -- Now, we need to find the distinct prime divisors of 1092.
  -- We'll start by factoring 1092:
  -- $1092 = 2^2 \cdot 273 = 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 91 = 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 7 \cdot 13$
  -- So the distinct prime divisors are 2, 3, 7, and 13.

  have h₂ : Nat.divisors a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 21, 26, 28, 39, 42, 52, 65, 78, 91, 130, 156, 182, 195, 364, 390, 1092} := by
    rw [h₁]
    decide

  -- From the list of divisors, the distinct prime divisors are:
  -- {2, 3, 7, 13}

  have h₃ : Finset.filter (fun x => Nat.Prime x) (Nat.divisors a) = {2, 3, 7, 13} := by
    rw [h₂]
    decide

  -- And their sum is $2 + 3 + 7 + 13 = 25$

  rw [h₃]
