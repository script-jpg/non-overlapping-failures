-- -- Step 1: Calculate the divisors of 500
  -- The prime factorization of 500 is 2² × 5³
  -- The divisors of 500 are of the form 2^a × 5^b where 0 ≤ a ≤ 2 and 0 ≤ b ≤ 3
  -- Listing all divisors:
  -- a = 0: 1, 5, 25, 125
  -- a = 1: 2, 10, 50, 250
  -- a = 2: 4, 20, 100, 500
  -- Sum of divisors: (1+5+25+125) + (2+10+50+250) + (4+20+100+500) = 195 + 312 + 624 = 1131
  have h₁ : a = 1131 := by decide

  -- Step 2: Find the prime divisors of 1131
  -- Checking primality of 1131: 1131 = 3 × 377 = 3 × 13 × 29
  -- The distinct prime divisors of 1131 are 3, 13, and 29
  have h₂ : (Nat.Prime 3) = true := by decide
  have h₃ : (Nat.Prime 13) = true := by decide
  have h₄ : (Nat.Prime 29) = true := by decide

  -- Step 3: Calculate the sum of these prime divisors
  -- Sum = 3 + 13 + 29 = 45
  have h₅ : (3 + 13 + 29) = 45 := by decide

  -- Step 4: The sum of the distinct prime divisors of A (1131) is 45, but the problem asks for the sum of distinct prime divisors of A in the context of the formal proof
  -- The formal proof needs to compute the sum of distinct prime divisors of A, where A is the sum of divisors of 500
  -- Using the above results, we can complete the proof
