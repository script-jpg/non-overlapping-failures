-- -- First, we need to understand what we're being asked to prove.
  -- The problem asks us to find the sum of the distinct prime divisors of $A$, where $A$ is the sum of the positive divisors of $500$.
  -- The final answer is supposed to be 25.

  -- Let's start by setting up the theorem statement:
  have h₁ : a = ∑ k in Nat.divisors 500, k := h₀

  -- To solve this, I'll need to:
  -- 1. Find the sum of the positive divisors of 500 (which is $A$)
  -- 2. Determine the distinct prime divisors of $A$
  -- 3. Sum those prime divisors

  -- First, let's find the prime factorization of 500:
  -- $500 = 2^2 \cdot 5^3$

  -- The formula for the sum of divisors of a number $n = p_1^{k_1} \cdot p_2^{k_2} \cdot \ldots \cdot p_m^{k_m}$ is:
  -- $\sigma(n) = (1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \ldots + p_1^{k_1})(1 + p_2 + p_2^2 + \ldots + p_2^{k_2}) \ldots (1 + p_m + p_m^2 + \ldots + p_m^{k_m})$

  -- So for $500 = 2^2 \cdot 5^3$:
  -- $\sigma(500) = (1 + 2 + 2^2)(1 + 5 + 5^2 + 5^3) = (1 + 2 + 4)(1 + 5 + 25 + 125) = 7 \cdot 156 = 1092$
  have h₂ : a = 1092 := by
    rw [h₁]
    native_decide

  -- Now we need to find the distinct prime divisors of 1092.
  -- Let's factorize 1092:
  -- $1092 = 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 7 \cdot 13$

  -- So the distinct prime divisors are 2, 3, 7, and 13.
  -- Their sum is $2 + 3 + 7 + 13 = 25$

  -- In Lean, we can compute this as:
  have h₃ : ∑ k in Finset.filter (fun x => Nat.Prime x) (Nat.divisors a), k = 25 := by
    rw [h₂]
    native_decide

  -- And that completes our proof! The sum of the distinct prime divisors of $A$ is indeed 25.
  exact h₃
