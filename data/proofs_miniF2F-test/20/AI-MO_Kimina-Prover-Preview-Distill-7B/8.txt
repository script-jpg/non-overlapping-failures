--   -- First, we need to compute the sum of the positive divisors of 500. The prime factorization of 500 is $2^2 \cdot 5^3$. The formula for the sum of divisors of a number $n = p_1^{k_1} \cdot p_2^{k_2} \cdot \ldots \cdot p_m^{k_m}$ is $(1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \ldots + p_1^{k_1})(1 + p_2 + \ldots + p_2^{k_2}) \ldots (1 + p_m + \ldots + p_m^{k_m})$.

  -- So for $500 = 2^2 \cdot 5^3$, the sum of divisors is $(1 + 2 + 2^2)(1 + 5 + 5^2 + 5^3) = (1 + 2 + 4)(1 + 5 + 25 + 125) = 7 \cdot 156 = 1092$.

  -- So $A = 1092$. Next, we need to find the distinct prime divisors of 1092. 

  --   - First, let's find the prime factorization of 1092. We divide 1092 by 2 (the smallest prime), yielding 546. We divide 546 by 2 again, yielding 273. 273 is not divisible by 2, so we try the next smallest prime, which is 3. We divide 273 by 3, yielding 91. 91 is not divisible by 3, so we try the next smallest prime, which is 5. However, 91 is not divisible by 5 either. The next smallest prime is 7. We divide 91 by 7, yielding 13. 13 is a prime number.

  -- So $1092 = 2^2 \cdot 3 \cdot 7 \cdot 13$. The distinct prime divisors are 2, 3, 7, and 13.

  --   - Therefore, the sum of the distinct prime divisors of $A$ is $2 + 3 + 7 + 13 = 25$.
