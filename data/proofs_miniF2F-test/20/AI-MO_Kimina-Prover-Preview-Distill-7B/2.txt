--   -- First, I need to understand what we're being asked to prove. We have:
  -- The sum of all positive divisors of 500 is equal to $312$. We need to find the sum of the distinct prime divisors of $312$.
  rw [h₀]
  -- The sum of the positive divisors of $500$ is indeed $312$.
  have : ∑ k in Nat.divisors 500, k = 312 := by decide
  rw [this]
  -- Now, I need to find the sum of the distinct prime divisors of $312$. Let's start by determining the prime factorization of $312$.
  -- $312 = 2^3 \cdot 3 \cdot 13$.
  have : Nat.divisors 312 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 13, 24, 26, 39, 52, 78, 104, 156, 312} := by decide
  rw [this]
  -- The distinct prime divisors of $312$ are $2$, $3$, and $13$.
  -- Therefore, the sum of the distinct prime divisors of $312$ is $2 + 3 + 13 = 18$.
  have : Finset.filter (fun x => Nat.Prime x) {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 13, 24, 26, 39, 52, 78, 104, 156, 312} = {2, 3, 13} := by decide
