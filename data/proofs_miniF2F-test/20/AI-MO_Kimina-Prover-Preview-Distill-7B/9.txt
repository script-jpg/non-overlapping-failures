--   If $A$ is the sum of the positive divisors of $500$, what is the sum of the distinct prime divisors of $A$? Show that it is 25.
  --   First, I need to analyze the mathematical problem. The positive divisors of 500 can be found by determining all numbers less than 500 that divide 500 without leaving a remainder.

  -- The sum of the positive divisors of 500 is 966. Now I need to find the prime divisors of 966.
  -- By factoring 966, I get 966 = 2 × 3 × 13 × 13. The distinct prime divisors are 2, 3, and 13.
  -- The sum of these prime divisors is 2 + 3 + 13 = 18.
