-- -- First, I need to understand what we're being asked to prove.
  -- We have:
  -- - a = sum of positive divisors of 500
  -- We need to find:
  -- - sum of distinct prime divisors of a

  -- Step 1: Find the prime factorization of 500
  -- 500 = 2^2 × 5^3

  -- Step 2: Find the sum of divisors of 500
  -- The formula for the sum of divisors of a number n = p₁^k₁ × p₂^k₂ ×... × pₘ^kₘ is:
  -- (1 + p₁ + p₁² +... + p₁^k₁) × (1 + p₂ + p₂² +... + p₂^k₂) ×... × (1 + pₘ + pₘ² +... + pₘ^kₘ)
  -- For 500 = 2² × 5³, the sum of divisors is:
  -- (1 + 2 + 4) × (1 + 5 + 25 + 125) = 7 × 156 = 1092
  -- So a = 1092

  -- Step 3: Find the distinct prime divisors of 1092
  -- 1092 = 2² × 3 × 7 × 13

  -- Step 4: Sum the distinct prime divisors
  -- 2 + 3 + 7 + 13 = 25

  -- Now, let's translate this into Lean 4 code:

  have h₁ : a = 1092 := by
    rw [h₀]
    native_decide

  -- Now we need to prove that the sum of distinct prime divisors of 1092 is 25
  have h₂ : (∑ k in Finset.filter (fun x => Nat.Prime x) (Nat.divisors 1092), k) = 25 := by
    -- The prime divisors of 1092 are 2, 3, 7, and 13
    -- Their sum is 2 + 3 + 7 + 13 = 25
    native_decide

  rw [h₁, h₂]
