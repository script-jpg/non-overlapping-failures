--   -- The prime factorization of 500 is $2^2 * 5^3$.
  --  have h₁ : Nat.primeFactors 500 = {2, 5} := by native_decide

  --  The sum of the divisors of a number $n = p_1^{k_1} * p_2^{k_2} * \dots * p_m^{k_m}$ is given by the formula
  --  $(1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \dots + p_1^{k_1})(1 + p_2 + p_2^2 + \dots + p_2^{k_2}) \dots (1 + p_m + p_m^2 + \dots + p_m^{k_m})$.
  --  Therefore, the sum of the divisors of 500 is $(1 + 2 + 4)(1 + 5 + 25 + 125) = 7 * 156 = 1092$.

  --  The sum of the distinct prime divisors of 1092 is 2 + 3 + 7 + 13 = 25.
