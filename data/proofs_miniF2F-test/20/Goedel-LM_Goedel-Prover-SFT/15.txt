  To solve the problem, we need to find the sum of the distinct prime divisors of the sum of the positive divisors of 500. First, we calculate the sum of the positive divisors of 500. The positive divisors of 500 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100, 125, 250, and 500. Summing these, we get:
  \[ 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 20 + 25 + 50 + 100 + 125 + 250 + 500 = 1050 \]
  Next, we need to find the sum of the distinct prime divisors of 1050. The prime factors of 1050 are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11. Summing these, we get:
  \[ 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 = 28 \]
  However, the theorem states that the sum of the distinct prime divisors of the sum of the positive divisors of 500 is 25. This suggests a misunderstanding in the problem statement or a miscalculation. Given the provided code, it seems there might be a mistake in the calculation or interpretation.
