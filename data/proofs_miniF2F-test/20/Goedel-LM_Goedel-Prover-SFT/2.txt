  To show that the sum of the distinct prime divisors of \( A \) is 25, where \( A \) is the sum of the positive divisors of 500, we proceed as follows:
  1. **Identify the divisors of 500**: The divisors of 500 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100, 125, 250, and 500.
  2. **Sum the divisors**: The sum of these divisors is \( 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 20 + 25 + 50 + 100 + 125 + 250 + 500 = 1275 \).
  3. **Identify the prime divisors**: The prime divisors of 1275 are 3, 5, and 13.
  4. **Sum the prime divisors**: The sum of these prime divisors is \( 3 + 5 + 13 = 21 \).
  Thus, the sum of the distinct prime divisors of \( A \) is 21.
