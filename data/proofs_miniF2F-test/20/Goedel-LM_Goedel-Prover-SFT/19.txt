  Given that \( A \) is the sum of the positive divisors of 500, we need to find the sum of the distinct prime divisors of \( A \). We show that this sum is 25.
  First, we express \( A \) as the sum of the divisors of 500. The divisors of 500 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100, 125, 250, 500. Therefore, \( A = 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 20 + 25 + 50 + 100 + 125 + 250 + 500 = 1126 \).
  Next, we identify the prime divisors of 1126. The prime factorization of 1126 is \( 1126 = 2 \times 5 \times 7 \times 13 \). Thus, the distinct prime divisors are 2, 5, 7, and 13.
  Finally, we sum these prime divisors: \( 2 + 5 + 7 + 13 = 27 \).
