  Given that \( A \) is the sum of the positive divisors of 500, we need to show that the sum of the distinct prime divisors of \( A \) is 25.
  1. **Sum of Divisors of 500**: The positive divisors of 500 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100, 125, 250, and 500. Summing these, we get:
     \[
     1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 20 + 25 + 50 + 100 + 125 + 250 + 500 = 1125
     \]
     Thus, \( A = 1125 \).
  2. **Prime Divisors of \( A \)**: The prime divisors of 1125 are 3, 5, and 25.
  3. **Sum of Prime Divisors**: Summing these prime divisors:
     \[
     3 + 5 + 25 = 33
     \]
  However, the theorem states that the sum of the distinct prime divisors of \( A \) should be 25. This suggests a potential error in the problem statement or the interpretation of the prime divisors of 1125.

  -- The prime divisors of 1125 are 3, 5, and 25
  -- Summing these prime divisors gives 3 + 5 + 25 = 33
