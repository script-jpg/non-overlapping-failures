  Given that \( A \) is the sum of the positive divisors of 500, we need to show that the sum of the distinct prime divisors of \( A \) is 25.
  1. The sum of the positive divisors of 500 is calculated as follows:
     \[
     A = \sum_{k=1}^{100} k = \frac{100 \times 101}{2} = 5050
     \]
  2. The prime divisors of 5050 are:
     \[
     \{2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 250, 505\}
     \]
  3. Summing these prime divisors:
     \[
     2 + 5 + 10 + 25 + 50 + 100 + 250 + 505 = 1035
     \]
  However, this result does not match the expected sum of 25. This discrepancy suggests a need for further verification or correction.
