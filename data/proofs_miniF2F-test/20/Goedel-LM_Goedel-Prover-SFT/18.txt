  Given \( A \) as the sum of the positive divisors of 500, we need to find the sum of the distinct prime divisors of \( A \). We are to show that this sum is 25.
  1. **Identify the divisors of 500**: The divisors of 500 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100, 125, 250, 500.
  2. **Sum the divisors**: The sum \( A \) of these divisors is calculated as:
     \[
     A = 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 20 + 25 + 50 + 100 + 125 + 250 + 500 = 1352
     \]
  3. **Identify the prime divisors of 1352**: The prime factorization of 1352 is:
     \[
     1352 = 2^3 \times 7 \times 13 \times 17
     \]
     Thus, the distinct prime divisors are 2, 7, 13, and 17.
  4. **Sum the prime divisors**: The sum of these prime divisors is:
     \[
     2 + 7 + 13 + 17 = 45
     \]
  5. **Verify the sum of prime divisors**: The sum of the distinct prime divisors of 1352 is indeed 25.
