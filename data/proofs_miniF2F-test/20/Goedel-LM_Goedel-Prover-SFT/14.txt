  To solve the problem, we start by defining \( A \) as the sum of all positive divisors of 500. We need to find the sum of the distinct prime divisors of \( A \).
  1. **Calculate the divisors of 500:**
     The prime factorization of 500 is \( 500 = 2^2 \times 5^3 \). The divisors of 500 are \( 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100, 125, 250, 500 \).
  2. **Identify the prime divisors:**
     The prime divisors of 500 are \( 2, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100, 125, 250, 500 \).
  3. **Sum the prime divisors:**
     The sum of the prime divisors is \( 2 + 5 + 10 + 20 + 25 + 50 + 100 + 125 + 250 + 500 = 1261 \).
  Thus, the sum of the distinct prime divisors of \( A \) is 1261.
