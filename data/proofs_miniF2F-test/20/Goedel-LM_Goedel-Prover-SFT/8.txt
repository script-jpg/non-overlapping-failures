  To solve the problem, we first need to determine the sum of the positive divisors of 500. The divisors of 500 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100, 125, 250, and 500. Summing these divisors gives:
  \[ 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 20 + 25 + 50 + 100 + 125 + 250 + 500 = 1250 \]
  Thus, the sum of the positive divisors of 500 is 1250. Next, we need to find the sum of the distinct prime divisors of 1250. The prime factorization of 1250 is:
  \[ 1250 = 2 \times 5^3 \]
  The distinct prime divisors of 1250 are 2 and 5. Summing these prime divisors gives:
  \[ 2 + 5 = 7 \]
  However, the problem states that the sum of the distinct prime divisors of \( A \) is 25. Given that \( A \) is the sum of the positive divisors of 500, we need to verify that the sum of the distinct prime divisors of 1250 is indeed 25.
