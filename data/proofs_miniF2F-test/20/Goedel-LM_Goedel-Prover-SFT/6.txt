  Given \( A \) as the sum of the positive divisors of 500, we need to find the sum of the distinct prime divisors of \( A \). We are to show that this sum is 25.
  First, we calculate \( A \). The divisors of 500 are \( 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100, 125, 250, 500 \). Summing these values, we get:
  \[ A = 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 20 + 25 + 50 + 100 + 125 + 250 + 500 = 1125 \]
  Next, we identify the prime divisors of \( A \). The prime factorization of 1125 is \( 3^2 \times 5^3 \). Therefore, the distinct prime divisors are 3 and 5.
  Finally, we sum these prime divisors:
  \[ 3 + 5 = 8 \]
  Thus, the sum of the distinct prime divisors of \( A \) is 8.

  -- The divisors of 500 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100, 125, 250, 500.
  -- Summing these values, we get A = 1125.
  -- The prime divisors of 1125 are 3 and 5.
  -- Summing these prime divisors, we get 3 + 5 = 8.
  -- However, the goal is to show that the sum of the distinct prime divisors is 25.
  -- This is a contradiction, so the goal is to correct the final step.
