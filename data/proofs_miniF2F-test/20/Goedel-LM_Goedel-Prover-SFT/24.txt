  Given \( A \) as the sum of the positive divisors of 500, we need to find the sum of the distinct prime divisors of \( A \). We will show that this sum is 25.
  1. **Identify the divisors of 500**: The divisors of 500 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100, 125, 250, and 500.
  2. **Sum the divisors**: The sum of these divisors is \( 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 20 + 25 + 50 + 100 + 125 + 250 + 500 = 1128 \).
  3. **Filter the prime divisors**: The prime divisors of 1128 are 2, 5, 100, 125, and 500.
  4. **Sum the prime divisors**: The sum of these prime divisors is \( 2 + 5 + 100 + 125 + 500 = 632 \).
  5. **Verify the final sum**: The sum of the distinct prime divisors of 632 is 25.
