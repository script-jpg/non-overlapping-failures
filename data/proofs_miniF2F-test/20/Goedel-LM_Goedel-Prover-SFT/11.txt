  To solve the problem, we need to determine the sum of the distinct prime divisors of the sum of the positive divisors of 500. We start by calculating the sum of the positive divisors of 500. The divisors of 500 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100, 125, 250, and 500. Summing these divisors, we get:
  \[ 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 20 + 25 + 50 + 100 + 125 + 250 + 500 = 1226 \]
  Next, we need to find the prime divisors of 1226. The prime factorization of 1226 is:
  \[ 1226 = 2 \times 13 \times 31 \]
  The distinct prime divisors of 1226 are 2, 13, and 31. Summing these prime divisors, we get:
  \[ 2 + 13 + 31 = 46 \]
  Thus, the sum of the distinct prime divisors of 1226 is 46.
