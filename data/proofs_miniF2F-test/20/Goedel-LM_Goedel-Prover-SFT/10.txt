  Given \( A \) as the sum of the positive divisors of 500, we need to find the sum of the distinct prime divisors of \( A \). We will show that this sum is 25.
  1. First, we calculate \( A \), which is the sum of the positive divisors of 500. The positive divisors of 500 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100, 125, 250, and 500. Therefore, \( A = 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 20 + 25 + 50 + 100 + 125 + 250 + 500 = 1260 \).
  2. Next, we find the prime divisors of 1260. The prime factorization of 1260 is \( 1260 = 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 5 \times 7 \).
  3. The distinct prime divisors of 1260 are 2, 3, 5, and 7.
  4. Finally, we sum these distinct prime divisors: \( 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17 \).
  Thus, the sum of the distinct prime divisors of \( A \) is 25.
