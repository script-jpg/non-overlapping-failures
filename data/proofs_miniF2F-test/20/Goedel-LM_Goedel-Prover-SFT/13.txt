  Given \( A \) as the sum of the positive divisors of 500, we need to find the sum of the distinct prime divisors of \( A \). The sum of the divisors of 500 is calculated as follows:
  - The divisors of 500 are \( 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100, 125, 250, 500 \).
  - Therefore, \( A = 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 20 + 25 + 50 + 100 + 125 + 250 + 500 = 1356 \).
  Next, we need to find the sum of the distinct prime divisors of \( A \):
  - The distinct prime divisors of \( A \) are \( 2, 5, 100 \).
  - Summing these, we get \( 2 + 5 + 100 = 107 \).
  However, the problem states that the sum of the distinct prime divisors of \( A \) should be 25. This suggests a potential error in the calculation or interpretation of the problem.
