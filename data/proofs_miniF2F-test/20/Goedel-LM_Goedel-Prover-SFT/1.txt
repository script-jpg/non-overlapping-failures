  Given \( A \) as the sum of the positive divisors of 500, we need to find the sum of the distinct prime divisors of \( A \). We know that the prime factorization of 500 is \( 500 = 2^2 \times 5^3 \). The sum of the divisors of 500 is calculated as follows:
  \[
  A = \sum_{k=1}^{2} k \times \sum_{l=1}^{3} k^l = 1 \times 1 + 2 \times 1 + 2 \times 2 + 2 \times 4 + 5 \times 1 + 5 \times 2 + 5 \times 4 + 5 \times 8 = 546
  \]
  Next, we identify the prime divisors of 546. The prime factorization of 546 is \( 546 = 2 \times 3 \times 7 \times 13 \). The distinct prime divisors are 2, 3, 7, and 13. Summing these prime divisors:
  \[
  2 + 3 + 7 + 13 = 25
  \]
  Thus, the sum of the distinct prime divisors of \( A \) is 25.
