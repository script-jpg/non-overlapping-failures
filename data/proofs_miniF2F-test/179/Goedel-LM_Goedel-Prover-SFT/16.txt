  To solve for \( f(g(2)) \) given \( f(x) = x + 1 \) and \( g(x) = x^2 + 3 \), we proceed as follows:
  1. First, compute \( g(2) \):
     \[
     g(2) = 2^2 + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7
     \]
  2. Next, compute \( f(g(2)) \):
     \[
     f(g(2)) = f(7) = 7 + 1 = 8
     \]
  Thus, the value of \( f(g(2)) \) is indeed 8.

  -- Compute g(2) using the definition of g
  have g2 : g 2 = 7 := by
    rw [h₁]  -- Substitute g(x) = x^2 + 3
    norm_num  -- Simplify the expression to get g(2) = 7
  -- Compute f(g(2)) using the definition of f
  have f_g2 : f (g 2) = 8 := by
    rw [h₀, g2]  -- Substitute f(x) = x + 1 and g(2) = 7
    norm_num  -- Simplify the expression to get f(7) = 8
  -- The final result
  exact f_g2
