  To solve for \( f(g(2)) \) where \( f(x) = x + 1 \) and \( g(x) = x^2 + 3 \), we proceed as follows:
  1. Compute \( g(2) \):
     \[
     g(2) = 2^2 + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7
     \]
  2. Substitute \( g(2) \) into \( f \):
     \[
     f(g(2)) = f(7) = 7 + 1 = 8
     \]
  Thus, the value of \( f(g(2)) \) is indeed 8.

  -- Compute g(2) using the definition of g
  have h₂ : g 2 = 2 ^ 2 + 3 := by rw [h₁]
  -- Simplify the expression for g(2)
  have h₃ : g 2 = 7 := by linarith
  -- Substitute g(2) into f and compute f(g(2))
  have h₄ : f (g 2) = f 7 := by rw [h₃]
  -- Use the definition of f to simplify the expression
  have h₅ : f 7 = 7 + 1 := by rw [h₀]
  -- Final simplification to get the result
  have h₆ : 7 + 1 = 8 := by norm_num
  -- Combine all steps to conclude the proof
