  To solve for \( f(g(2)) \) where \( f(x) = x + 1 \) and \( g(x) = x^2 + 3 \), we proceed as follows:
  1. Compute \( g(2) \):
     \[
     g(2) = 2^2 + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7
     \]
  2. Substitute \( g(2) \) into \( f \):
     \[
     f(g(2)) = f(7) = 7 + 1 = 8
     \]
  Thus, the value of \( f(g(2)) \) is indeed 8.

  -- Simplify g(2) to get the numerical value
  have g2_val : g 2 = 7 := by linarith
  -- Substitute g(2) into f and compute f(g(2))
  have f_g2 : f (g 2) = f 7 := by rw [g2_val]
  -- Simplify f(7) using the definition of f
  have f_7 : f 7 = 7 + 1 := by simp [h₀]
  -- Verify that f(7) equals 8
  have f_7_val : f 7 = 8 := by linarith
  -- Combine the results to show the final value
