  To solve the problem, we need to evaluate \( f(g(2)) \) given the functions \( f(x) = x + 1 \) and \( g(x) = x^2 + 3 \).
  1. First, we compute \( g(2) \):
     \[
     g(2) = 2^2 + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7
     \]
  2. Next, we substitute \( g(2) \) into the function \( f \):
     \[
     f(g(2)) = f(7) = 7 + 1 = 8
     \]
  Thus, the value of \( f(g(2)) \) is indeed 8.

    rw [h₁]  -- Apply the definition of g to 2
    norm_num  -- Simplify the expression 2^2 + 3 to 7
  -- Substitute g(2) into f and simplify
  simp_all only [h₂, h₀]  -- Apply the definitions of f and g to 7
  norm_num  -- Simplify the expression 7 + 1 to 8
