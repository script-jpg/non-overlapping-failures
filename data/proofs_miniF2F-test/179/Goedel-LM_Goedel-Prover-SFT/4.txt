  To solve for \( f(g(2)) \) given the functions \( f(x) = x + 1 \) and \( g(x) = x^2 + 3 \), we proceed as follows:
  1. First, compute \( g(2) \):
     \[
     g(2) = 2^2 + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7
     \]
  2. Next, compute \( f(g(2)) = f(7) \):
     \[
     f(7) = 7 + 1 = 8
     \]
  Thus, the value of \( f(g(2)) \) is indeed 8.
