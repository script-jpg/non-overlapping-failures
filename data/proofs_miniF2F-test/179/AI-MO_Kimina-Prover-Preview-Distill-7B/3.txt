-- The value of $g(2)$ is $2^2 + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7$.

  -- Substituting this into $f(x)$, we get $f(g(2)) = f(7) = 7 + 1 = 8$.
  rw [this, h₀]

The key insight is to break down the problem into two steps: first, calculate the value of $g(2)$; and second, use that result to find $f(g(2))$. The Lean proof mirrors this informal reasoning exactly.

1. We start by establishing that $g(2) = 7$. This is done by:
   - Using the definition of $g$ from hypothesis `h₁`
   - Calculating $2^2 + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7$ with Lean's `norm_num` tactic

2. With $g(2) = 7$ established, we then find $f(g(2)) = f(7)$:
   - Using the definition of $f$ from hypothesis `h₀`
   - Calculating $7 + 1 = 8$ with Lean's `norm_num` tactic

The Lean code is remarkably concise because Lean's automation can handle simple arithmetic calculations like $2^2 + 3 = 7$ and $7 + 1 = 8$ directly. The proof mainly involves substituting the function definitions and then performing numerical calculations.

Therefore, the value of $f(g(2))$ is indeed 8.
