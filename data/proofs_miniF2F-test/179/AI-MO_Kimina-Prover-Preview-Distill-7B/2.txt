This proof is straightforward. We first compute the value of $g(2)$ using its definition, and then substitute that value into $f$ using the definition of $f$.

The key insight is that when we have a function composition like $f(g(x))$, we evaluate the inner function $g$ first, and then apply the outer function $f$ to the result. In this case:
1. Compute $g(2) = 2^2 + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7$
2. Then compute $f(g(2)) = f(7) = 7 + 1 = 8$

The Lean proof captures this reasoning exactly:
- We prove `g 2 = 7` by unfolding the definition of `g` using `h₁` and then simplifying with `norm_num`
- We substitute `g 2 = 7` into the goal `f (g 2) = 8`, transforming it to `f 7 = 8`
- We then unfold the definition of `f` using `h₀` to get `7 + 1 = 8`
- Finally, `norm_num` proves that `7 + 1 = 8` is indeed true

Therefore, the value of $f(g(2))$ is 8.
