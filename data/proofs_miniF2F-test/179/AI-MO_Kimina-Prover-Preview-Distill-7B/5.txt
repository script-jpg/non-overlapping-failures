-- The value of $g(2)$ is $2^2 + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7$.

  -- Substituting this into $f(x)$, we get $f(g(2)) = f(7) = 7 + 1 = 8$.

```

The proof is straightforward: we first calculate $g(2) = 2^2 + 3 = 7$, and then $f(g(2)) = f(7) = 7 + 1 = 8$.

The key insight in this problem is understanding function composition. The function $f(g(x))$ is not simply $f(x) + g(x)$, but rather $f(g(x))$. So we must calculate $g(2)$ first, and then apply $f$ to the result.

This problem also demonstrates the importance of carefully reading function definitions. If we had mistakenly thought $f(g(x)) = f(x) + g(x)$, we would have obtained $f(g(2)) = f(2) + g(2) = (2 + 1) + (4 + 3) = 3 + 7 = 10$, which is incorrect.

The final answer is indeed $\boxed{8}$.
