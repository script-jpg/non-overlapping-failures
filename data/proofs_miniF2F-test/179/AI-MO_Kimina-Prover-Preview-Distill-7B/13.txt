This proof is straightforward. We first compute the value of $g(2)$ using its definition, and then substitute that value into $f(x)$ to get the final result. The Lean proof follows the exact same reasoning process as the informal solution, using the given hypotheses to rewrite $f(g(2))$ into its final form. The `rw` tactic rewrites $g(2)$ as $2^2 + 3$ using hypothesis `h₁`, then simplifies that to $7$ using `norm_num`. Similarly, it rewrites $f(7)$ as $7 + 1$ using hypothesis `h₀`, and then simplifies that to $8$ using `norm_num`.
