-- The function $f$ takes a real number input and outputs a real number.
  -- The function $g$ takes a real number input and outputs a real number.
  -- We have two hypotheses: $f(x) = x + 1$ and $g(x) = x^2 + 3$ for all real $x$.
  -- We need to compute $f(g(2))$.

  -- First, let's compute $g(2)$:
  -- $g(2) = 2^2 + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7$

  -- Then, compute $f(g(2)) = f(7)$:
  -- $f(7) = 7 + 1 = 8$

  -- We can formalize this as follows:

  calc
    f (g 2) = f (2 ^ 2 + 3) := by rw [h₁] -- Replace $g(2)$ with $2^2 + 3$ using the hypothesis $h₁$.
    _ = f (4 + 3) := by norm_num -- Calculate $2^2 = 4$ and $4 + 3 = 7$.
    _ = f 7 := by norm_num -- Simplify $4 + 3$ to get $7$.
    _ = 7 + 1 := by rw [h₀] -- Apply the hypothesis $h₀$ to replace $f(7)$ with $7 + 1$.
    _ = 8 := by norm_num -- Calculate $7 + 1 = 8$.
