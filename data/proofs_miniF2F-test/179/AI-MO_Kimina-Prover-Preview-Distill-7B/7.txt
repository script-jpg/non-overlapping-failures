The theorem states that if $f(x) = x + 1$ and $g(x) = x^2 + 3$, then $f(g(2)) = 8$. We first compute $g(2) = 2^2 + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7$. Then we compute $f(g(2)) = f(7) = 7 + 1 = 8$. The Lean proof follows this reasoning exactly, using `h₁` to rewrite $g(2)$ as $2^2 + 3$ and then evaluating to get $7$, and using `h₀` to rewrite $f(7)$ as $7 + 1$ and then evaluating to get $8$.

The final answer is $ \boxed{8} $
