The proof is straightforward. First, we calculate $g(2) = 2^2 + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7$. Then, we find $f(g(2)) = f(7) = 7 + 1 = 8$. The Lean proof mirrors this reasoning exactly by:
1. Using the definition of $g$ to show $g(2) = 7$
2. Substituting $g(2) = 7$ into $f(g(2))$
3. Using the definition of $f$ to show $f(7) = 8$

This demonstrates how Lean can be used to verify simple algebraic calculations by formalizing the functions' definitions and evaluating them at specific points.
