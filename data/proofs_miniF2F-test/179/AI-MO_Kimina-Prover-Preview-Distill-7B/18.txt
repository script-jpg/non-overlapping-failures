The proof is straightforward: we first calculate $g(2) = 2^2 + 3 = 7$, and then $f(g(2)) = f(7) = 7 + 1 = 8$. The Lean proof accurately reflects this informal reasoning by first establishing that $g(2) = 7$ as an intermediate step, and then using that to show $f(g(2)) = 8$.

The key insight is that $f(g(x))$ is the composition of the functions $f$ and $g$. For any input $x$, $g$ transforms it to $x^2 + 3$, and then $f$ transforms that result to $(x^2 + 3) + 1 = x^2 + 4$. Therefore, $f(g(x)) = x^2 + 4$. When $x = 2$, we get $f(g(2)) = 2^2 + 4 = 4 + 4 = 8$.

This problem demonstrates the fundamental algebraic operation of function composition, where the output of one function becomes the input of another. In more complex problems, we might need to find general expressions for $f(g(x))$ or evaluate it at specific points without calculating the intermediate value explicitly.
