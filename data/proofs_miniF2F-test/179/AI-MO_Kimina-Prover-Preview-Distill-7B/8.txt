This proof is straightforward. We first compute the value of $g(2)$ using its definition, and then substitute that value into $f(g(2))$ to find the result.

The value of $g(2)$ is calculated as follows:
- $g(2) = 2^2 + 3$ by the definition of $g$
- $2^2 = 4$ by basic arithmetic
- $4 + 3 = 7$ by basic arithmetic

So $g(2) = 7$.

Now we compute $f(g(2)) = f(7)$:
- $f(7) = 7 + 1$ by the definition of $f$
- $7 + 1 = 8$ by basic arithmetic

So $f(g(2)) = 8$.

The Lean proof captures this reasoning by:
1. Proving that $g(2) = 7$ using the definition of $g$
2. Substituting $g(2) = 7$ into $f(g(2))$ to get $f(7)$
3. Using the definition of $f$ to compute $f(7) = 8$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{8}$.
