-- The value of $g(2)$ is $2^2 + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7$.

    norm_num

  -- The value of $f(g(2)) = f(7)$ is $7 + 1 = 8$.
  rw [this, h₀]

```

The proof is straightforward: we first calculate $g(2) = 2^2 + 3 = 7$, and then $f(g(2)) = f(7) = 7 + 1 = 8$.

# Formalizing the Proof in Lean 4

Let's translate this proof into Lean 4 code:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

We begin by importing the necessary libraries and setting up the basic framework. The `maxHeartbeats` setting is increased to allow for more complex proof search.

Now, let's define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_143 (f g : ℝ → ℝ) (h₀ : ∀ x, f x = x + 1) (h₁ : ∀ x, g x = x ^ 2 + 3) :
    f (g 2) = 8 := by
```

We have a theorem with two functions $f, g: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, where $f(x) = x + 1$ and $g(x) = x^2 + 3$, and we need to prove that $f(g(2)) = 8$.

To prove this, we'll first compute $g(2)$:
- $g(2) = 2^2 + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7$

Then compute $f(g(2)) = f(7)$:
- $f(7) = 7 + 1 = 8$

Let's complete the proof:

```tactics
have : g 2 = 7 := by
  rw [h₁]
  norm_num
```

This establishes that $g(2) = 7$. We use `h₁` to rewrite $g(2)$ as $2^2 + 3$, and then `norm_num` to compute that $2^2 + 3 = 7$.

Now we can compute $f(g(2)) = f(7)$:

```tactics
rw [this, h₀]
norm_num
```

Here, we substitute $g(2) = 7$ into $f(g(2))$, giving us $f(7)$. Then we use `h₀` to rewrite $f(7)$ as $7 + 1$. Finally, `norm_num` computes that $7 + 1 = 8$.

Therefore, $f(g(2)) = 8$, which completes our proof.
