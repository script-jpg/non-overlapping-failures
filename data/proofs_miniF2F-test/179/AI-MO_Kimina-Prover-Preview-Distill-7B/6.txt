In this proof, we first need to compute the value of $g(2)$. According to the definition of $g(x)$, we have $g(2) = 2^2 + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7$. This is captured in the lemma `g_2`.

Then, we substitute $g(2) = 7$ into $f(g(2))$, which becomes $f(7)$. According to the definition of $f(x)$, we have $f(7) = 7 + 1 = 8$.

Therefore, $f(g(2)) = 8$.

This problem demonstrates the concept of function composition, where the output of one function is used as the input of another function. In mathematics, this is represented as $f(g(x))$, which means $f(g(x))$ is first evaluated by computing $g(x)$, and then using that result as the input to $f$.

The Lean proof mirrors this reasoning by first proving $g(2) = 7$ as an intermediate step, and then using that to prove $f(g(2)) = 8$.
