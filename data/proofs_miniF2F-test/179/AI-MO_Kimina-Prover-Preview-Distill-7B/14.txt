This solution is straightforward. We first calculate $g(2) = 2^2 + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7$. Then we substitute this into $f(g(2))$ to get $f(7) = 7 + 1 = 8$.

The Lean proof follows this reasoning exactly. We:
1. Import the necessary libraries
2. Define the theorem with the given functions and the goal of proving $f(g(2)) = 8$
3. Calculate $g(2) = 2^2 + 3 = 7$ using the definition of $g$
4. Substitute $g(2) = 7$ into $f(g(2))$ to get $f(7)$
5. Use the definition of $f$ to get $f(7) = 7 + 1 = 8$
6. Lean's automation handles the arithmetic

Therefore, $f(g(2)) = 8$.
