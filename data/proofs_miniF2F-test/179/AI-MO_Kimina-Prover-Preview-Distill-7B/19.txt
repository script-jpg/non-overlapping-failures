This Lean 4 proof demonstrates how to compute the composition of two functions. First, we calculate the value of $g(2)$. According to the definition of $g(x)$, we have $g(2) = 2^2 + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7$. 

Next, we need to find $f(g(2)) = f(7)$. Using the definition of $f(x)$, we have $f(7) = 7 + 1 = 8$. 

Therefore, the value of $f(g(2))$ is $8$. The Lean proof formalizes these steps by:
1. Using the hypothesis `h₁` to show that $g(2) = 2^2 + 3$
2. Computing $2^2 + 3 = 7$ with Lean's `norm_num` tactic
3. Substituting $g(2) = 7$ into $f(g(2))$ to get $f(7)$
4. Using the hypothesis `h₀` to show that $f(7) = 7 + 1$
5. Computing $7 + 1 = 8$ with Lean's `norm_num` tactic

This completes the proof that $f(g(2)) = 8$.
