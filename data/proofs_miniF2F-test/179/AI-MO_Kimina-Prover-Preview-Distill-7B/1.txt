This proof is straightforward. We first calculate $g(2)$ using the definition of $g$, and then apply the definition of $f$ to compute $f(g(2))$.

The formal Lean 4 proof closely follows the mathematical reasoning:
1. We need to prove that $f(g(2)) = 8$.
2. To do this, we first need to determine the value of $g(2)$.
3. Using the definition of $g(x) = x^2 + 3$, we find $g(2) = 2^2 + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7$.
4. Then, using the definition of $f(x) = x + 1$, we find $f(g(2)) = f(7) = 7 + 1 = 8$.
5. The Lean proof captures this reasoning exactly by:
   - Establishing that $g(2) = 7$ as an intermediate step
   - Substituting this value and applying the definition of $f$
   - Verifying the final numerical result

Therefore, $f(g(2)) = 8$.
