The proof is straightforward by directly applying the given function definitions. We first compute $g(2) = 2^2 + 3 = 7$, and then compute $f(g(2)) = f(7) = 7 + 1 = 8$.

**Analysis:**

This problem tests the understanding of function evaluation. The key insight is that $f(g(2)) \neq g(f(2))$ in general, so we must evaluate the functions in the correct order. First, we evaluate $g(2) = 2^2 + 3 = 7$. Then, we evaluate $f(g(2)) = f(7) = 7 + 1 = 8$.

**Comments:**

The proof uses direct substitution and evaluation to arrive at the answer. This is a fundamental problem in algebra that demonstrates the importance of understanding function evaluation order. The Lean proof elegantly captures this reasoning by first establishing that $g(2) = 7$ and then showing that $f(g(2)) = f(7) = 8$.
