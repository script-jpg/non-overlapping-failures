-- The value of $g(2)$ is $2^2 + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7$.

  -- We have $f(x) = x + 1$ for all $x$, so $f(7) = 7 + 1 = 8$.
  rw [this, h₀]
  norm_num
```

This proof is straightforward. We first compute the value of $g(2)$ using the definition of $g$, and then apply the function $f$ to this result using the definition of $f$.

The key insight is that we can compute $g(2)$ exactly:
- $g(2) = 2^2 + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7$

Then we compute $f(g(2)) = f(7)$:
- $f(7) = 7 + 1 = 8$

So $f(g(2)) = 8$.

Let's translate this into Lean 4 code:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

```

We begin by importing the necessary libraries and setting up the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_143 (f g : ℝ → ℝ) (h₀ : ∀ x, f x = x + 1) (h₁ : ∀ x, g x = x ^ 2 + 3) :
    f (g 2) = 8 := by
```

Now we need to prove that $f(g(2)) = 8$. Let's compute this step by step.

First, we'll determine the value of $g(2)$. By the definition of $g(x)$:
$g(2) = 2^2 + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7$

Then we'll compute $f(g(2)) = f(7)$. By the definition of $f(x)$:
$f(7) = 7 + 1 = 8$

So we should prove that $f(g(2)) = 8$ by showing $g(2) = 7$ and then $f(7) = 8$.

In Lean, we can proceed as follows:

```tactics
have : g 2 = 7 := by
  rw [h₁]
  norm_num
```

Now we have established that $g(2) = 7$. Next, we need to show that $f(7) = 8$:

```tactics
rw [this, h₀]
norm_num
```

And with that, we've completed the proof that $f(g(2)) = 8$. The Lean proof effectively captures the informal reasoning by first computing the inner function value $g(2)$, then using that result as input to the outer function $f$.
