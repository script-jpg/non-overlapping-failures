  We need to calculate the total surface area of the tower formed by seven cubes with volumes \(1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343\) cubic units. The tower is stacked vertically, with the bottom face of each cube lying on top of the cube below it.
  First, we identify the side lengths of the cubes by taking the cube roots of their volumes:
  - The side length of the cube with volume 1 is \(1\).
  - The side length of the cube with volume 8 is \(2\).
  - The side length of the cube with volume 27 is \(3\).
  - The side length of the cube with volume 64 is \(4\).
  - The side length of the cube with volume 125 is \(5\).
  - The side length of the cube with volume 216 is \(6\).
  - The side length of the cube with volume 343 is \(7\).
  Next, we calculate the surface area of the tower by considering the top and bottom faces of the cubes, and the vertical faces connecting the cubes. The top face of each cube is a square with side length \(a_k\), where \(a_k\) is the side length of the cube with volume \(k^3\). The bottom face of each cube is a square with side length \(a_k\), and the vertical faces are rectangles with dimensions \(a_k \times a_{k-1}\).
  The total surface area of the tower is given by:
  \[
  \text{Surface Area} = \sum_{k=1}^{7} (a_k^2 + a_k \cdot a_{k-1})
  \]
  However, since the bottom face of the first cube is not a square, we need to subtract the area of the bottom face of the first cube, which is \(a_1^2\), from the total surface area.
  Given the side lengths \(a_k = k\), we have:
  \[
  \text{Surface Area} = \sum_{k=1}^{7} (k^2 + k \cdot (k-1)) - a_1^2
  \]
  Calculating each term:
  \[
  \sum_{k=1}^{7} (k^2 + k \cdot (k-1)) = \sum_{k=1}^{7} (k^2 + k^2 - k) = \sum_{k=1}^{7} (2k^2 - k)
  \]
  \[
  = 2 \sum_{k=1}^{7} k^2 - \sum_{k=1}^{7} k
  \]
  \[
  = 2 \left(\frac{7 \cdot 8}{2}\right) - \left(\frac{7 \cdot 8}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot 28 - 28 = 56 - 28 = 28
  \]
  Thus, the total surface area is:
  \[
  28 - a_1^2 = 28 - 1^2 = 28 - 1 = 27
  \]
  However, this result does not match the expected surface area of 658. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem setup or the calculation.
