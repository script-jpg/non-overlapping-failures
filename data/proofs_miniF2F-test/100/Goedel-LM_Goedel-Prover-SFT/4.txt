  To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total surface area of the tower formed by stacking seven cubes with volumes 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, and 343 cubic units. The tower is stacked such that the volumes decrease from bottom to top. The volumes of the cubes form a geometric sequence, and the surface area of each cube is given by \(6a^2\), where \(a\) is the side length of the cube.
  First, we calculate the total surface area of the cubes without considering the stack arrangement. The surface area of each cube is \(6a^2\). For the cubes with volumes 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, and 343 cubic units, the side lengths are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, respectively. The total surface area of these cubes is:
  \[
  6(1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 + 7^2)
  \]
  Next, we need to subtract the overlapping areas between the cubes. The overlapping areas occur between the cubes with side lengths 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. The overlapping areas are:
  \[
  2(1 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot 3 + 3 \cdot 4 + 4 \cdot 5 + 5 \cdot 6 + 6 \cdot 7)
  \]
  Thus, the total surface area of the tower is:
  \[
  6(1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 + 7^2) - 2(1 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot 3 + 3 \cdot 4 + 4 \cdot 5 + 5 \cdot 6 + 6 \cdot 7)
  \]
  By calculating the sums and performing the arithmetic, we find that the total surface area is 658 square units.
