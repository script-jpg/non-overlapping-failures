  To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total surface area of the tower formed by seven cubes with volumes \(1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343\) cubic units, stacked vertically with the volumes decreasing from bottom to top. Each cube on top has its bottom face completely on top of the cube below it.
  First, we determine the side lengths of the cubes:
  - The cube with volume 343 has a side length of 7.
  - The cube with volume 216 has a side length of 6.
  - The cube with volume 125 has a side length of 5.
  - The cube with volume 64 has a side length of 4.
  - The cube with volume 27 has a side length of 3.
  - The cube with volume 8 has a side length of 2.
  - The cube with volume 1 has a side length of 1.
  Next, we calculate the total surface area of the tower, considering that the top cube has a top face that is not exposed and the bottom cube has no top face exposed. We sum the exposed faces of all cubes, excluding the top and bottom faces.
  The surface area of each cube is \(6 \times \text{side length}^2\). We then subtract the top and bottom faces, which are not exposed.
  For the cubes with side lengths 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1, the exposed faces are:
  - \(6 \times 7^2 = 294\)
  - \(6 \times 6^2 = 216\)
  - \(6 \times 5^2 = 150\)
  - \(6 \times 4^2 = 96\)
  - \(6 \times 3^2 = 54\)
  - \(6 \times 2^2 = 24\)
  - \(6 \times 1^2 = 6\)
  Summing these exposed faces, we get:
  \[ 294 + 216 + 150 + 96 + 54 + 24 + 6 = 942 \]
  However, this calculation includes the top and bottom faces, which are not exposed. We need to subtract these 12 faces (6 cubes, each with 2 faces).
  \[ 942 - 12 = 930 \]
  Thus, the total surface area of the tower is \(930\).
