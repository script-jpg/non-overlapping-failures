  We need to show that the total surface area of the tower formed by seven cubes with volumes 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, and 343 cubic units, arranged vertically such that the volumes decrease from bottom to top, is 658 square units. The total surface area of the tower includes the top face of each cube and the bottom face of the cubes below it.
  Given the volumes and their corresponding side lengths, we can calculate the total surface area by summing the areas of the top faces of all cubes and the bottom faces of the cubes below them. The top face of each cube has an area of 1 square unit, and the bottom face of each cube has an area of 1 square unit. The total surface area is calculated by summing these areas for all cubes.
