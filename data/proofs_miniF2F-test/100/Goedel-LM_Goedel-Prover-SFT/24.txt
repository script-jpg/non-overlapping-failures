  To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total surface area of the tower formed by stacking seven cubes with volume sequences \(1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343\) cubic units. The total surface area includes both the top and bottom faces of all cubes, excluding the bottom face of the bottom cube.
  1. **Calculate the side lengths of the cubes**:
     - The volume of the bottom cube is 1, so its side length is \(1^3 = 1\).
     - The volume of the second cube is 8, so its side length is \(2^3 = 8\).
     - The volume of the third cube is 27, so its side length is \(3^3 = 27\).
     - The volume of the fourth cube is 64, so its side length is \(4^3 = 64\).
     - The volume of the fifth cube is 125, so its side length is \(5^3 = 125\).
     - The volume of the sixth cube is 216, so its side length is \(6^3 = 216\).
     - The volume of the top cube is 343, so its side length is \(7^3 = 343\).
  2. **Calculate the top and bottom faces**:
     - The top face of each cube is a square with side length equal to the cube's side length.
     - The bottom face of each cube is a square with side length equal to the cube's side length.
  3. **Sum the top and bottom faces**:
     - The top face of the bottom cube is \(1^2 = 1\).
     - The top face of the second cube is \(2^2 = 4\).
     - The top face of the third cube is \(3^2 = 9\).
     - The top face of the fourth cube is \(4^2 = 16\).
     - The top face of the fifth cube is \(5^2 = 25\).
     - The top face of the sixth cube is \(6^2 = 36\).
     - The top face of the top cube is \(7^2 = 49\).
  4. **Calculate the total surface area**:
     - The total surface area is the sum of the top and bottom faces of all cubes, excluding the bottom face of the bottom cube.
     - The total surface area is calculated as:
       \[
       \text{Total Surface Area} = \sum_{k=1}^{7} (6 \times k^2) - 2 \times \sum_{k=1}^{6} k^2
       \]
  5. **Simplify the expression**:
     - The sum of the squares of the side lengths from 1 to 7 is:
       \[
       \sum_{k=1}^{7} k^2 = \frac{7 \times 8 \times 15}{6} = 140
       \]
     - The sum of the squares of the side lengths from 1 to 6 is:
       \[
       \sum_{k=1}^{6} k^2 = \frac{6 \times 7 \times 13}{6} = 130
       \]
     - Therefore, the total surface area is:
       \[
       \text{Total Surface Area} = 6 \times 140 - 2 \times 130 = 840 - 260 = 580
       \]
