  To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total surface area of the tower formed by stacking seven cubes with volumes 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, and 343 cubic units. The tower is arranged such that the bottom cube has a volume of 1 cubic unit, and each subsequent cube has a volume that is a perfect cube (1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343). The surface area of the tower is calculated by summing the areas of all the faces of the cubes, considering that the top cube has only one face exposed, and the other cubes have all six faces exposed.

  -- Calculate the sum of the areas of the faces of the cubes.
  -- The total surface area of the tower is the sum of the areas of all the faces of the cubes.
  -- The top cube has only one face exposed, and the other cubes have all six faces exposed.
  -- Therefore, the total surface area is calculated as follows:
  -- 1. The top cube has one face exposed, which is 1 square unit.
  -- 2. The other cubes have all six faces exposed, which is 6 * 2 + 6 * 3 + 6 * 4 + 6 * 5 + 6 * 6 + 6 * 7 = 126 square units.
  -- 3. The total surface area is the sum of these two areas: 1 + 126 = 127 square units.
  -- However, the problem states that the total surface area is 658 square units, which suggests a mistake in the calculation or interpretation of the problem.
  -- Given the constraints, we need to verify the final calculation.
