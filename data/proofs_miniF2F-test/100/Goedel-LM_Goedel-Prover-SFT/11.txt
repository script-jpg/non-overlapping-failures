  To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total surface area of the tower formed by stacking seven cubes with volumes 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, and 343 cubic units. Each cube has a volume of \( k^3 \) where \( k \) is the side length of the cube. The top cube has a side length of 7, and the bottom cube has a side length of 1. The total surface area of the tower is given by the sum of the areas of all the faces of the cubes, excluding the bottom face.
  The sum of the side lengths of the cubes is \( 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 \). The total surface area of the tower is then \( 6 \times (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 + 7^2) \).
  Calculating the sum of the squares of the side lengths:
  \[ 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 + 7^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 36 + 49 = 121 \]
  Thus, the total surface area is:
  \[ 6 \times 121 = 726 \]
  However, we need to subtract the bottom face of the tower, which is not exposed in the given problem. The bottom face of the tower is a 1x1 face, so the total surface area is:
  \[ 726 - 1 = 725 \]
  Finally, we need to verify that the total surface area is indeed 658, as given in the problem statement.
