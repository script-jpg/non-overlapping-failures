  To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total surface area of the tower formed by seven cubes with volumes 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, and 343 cubic units. The cubes are stacked vertically, and the bottom face of each cube lies completely on top of the cube below it.
  1. **Determine the side lengths of the cubes**:
     - The volume of the first cube (volume 1) is \(1^3 = 1\).
     - The volume of the second cube (volume 8) is \(2^3 = 8\).
     - The volume of the third cube (volume 27) is \(3^3 = 27\).
     - The volume of the fourth cube (volume 64) is \(4^3 = 64\).
     - The volume of the fifth cube (volume 125) is \(5^3 = 125\).
     - The volume of the sixth cube (volume 216) is \(6^3 = 216\).
     - The volume of the seventh cube (volume 343) is \(7^3 = 343\).
  2. **Calculate the surface area of the tower**:
     - Each cube has 6 faces, and the top face is not exposed as the top cube has a volume of 1.
     - The total surface area is calculated by summing the areas of all faces, considering the volumes of the cubes.
  3. **Adjust for the correct calculation**:
     - The correct calculation involves adjusting for the fact that the top cube has a volume of 1, and the other cubes have volumes of 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, and 343.
     - The correct total surface area is given by the formula involving the sum of the areas of the faces of all cubes, adjusted for the overlapping faces.
  4. **Final calculation**:
     - The final calculation involves simplifying the sum of the areas of the faces, considering the volumes of the cubes, and adjusting for the overlapping faces.
