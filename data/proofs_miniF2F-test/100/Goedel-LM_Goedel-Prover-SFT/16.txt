  To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total surface area of the tower formed by stacking seven cubes with volumes 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, and 343 cubic units. The volumes are given as \(a_0^3 = 1\), \(a_1^3 = 8\), \(a_2^3 = 27\), \(a_3^3 = 64\), \(a_4^3 = 125\), \(a_5^3 = 216\), and \(a_6^3 = 343\). The total surface area of the tower can be calculated by summing the areas of the six faces of each cube, considering the volumes.
