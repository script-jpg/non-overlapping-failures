  To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total surface area of the tower formed by stacking the cubes with volumes \(1\), \(8\), \(27\), \(64\), \(125\), \(216\), and \(343\) cubic units. The total surface area includes the top and bottom faces of all cubes, with the top face of each cube lying on top of the cube below it.
  1. **Identify the number of cubes**: There are 7 cubes with volumes \(1\), \(8\), \(27\), \(64\), \(125\), \(216\), and \(343\) cubic units.
  2. **Determine the side lengths**: The side lengths of the cubes are the cube roots of their volumes:
     - \(1^3 = 1\)
     - \(2^3 = 8\)
     - \(3^3 = 27\)
     - \(4^3 = 64\)
     - \(5^3 = 125\)
     - \(6^3 = 216\)
     - \(7^3 = 343\)
  3. **Calculate the total surface area**: The total surface area includes the top and bottom faces of all cubes. Each cube has a top and bottom face, so the total surface area is \(2 \times (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 + 7^2)\).
  4. **Calculate the sum of squares**: The sum of the squares of the side lengths is \(1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 + 7^2\).
  5. **Compute the total surface area**: Multiply the sum of the squares by 2 and subtract the sum of the squares of the side lengths of the cubes.
  6. **Final calculation**: The total surface area is \(658\).
