  To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total surface area of the tower formed by stacking the volumes of seven cubes, each with side lengths 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. The volume of each cube is its side length cubed. The total surface area of the tower is given by the sum of the areas of all faces of the cubes, with the top cube having a surface area of 54 (since it only shows 5 faces), and the bottom cube having a surface area of 6 (since it shows 6 faces).
