  We need to show that the total surface area of the tower formed by stacking seven cubes with volumes 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, and 343 cubic units, where the bottom face of each cube lies completely on top of the cube below it, is 658 square units. The total surface area includes the top and bottom faces of all cubes, and we subtract the areas of the top faces of the cubes that are stacked on top of each other.
