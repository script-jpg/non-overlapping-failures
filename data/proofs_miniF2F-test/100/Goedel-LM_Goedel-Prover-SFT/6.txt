  To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total surface area of the tower formed by seven cubes with side lengths corresponding to the cube roots of the given volumes. The volumes are \(1\), \(8\), \(27\), \(64\), \(125\), \(216\), and \(343\) cubic units. The cubes are stacked vertically, with the volumes of the cubes decreasing from bottom to top. The bottom face of each cube lies completely on top of the cube below it.
  Given the side lengths of the cubes, we can calculate the total surface area of the tower. The surface area of each cube is \(6 \times \text{side}^2\). The total surface area of the tower is the sum of the surface areas of all cubes, minus the overlapping faces.
  The overlapping faces at the top and bottom are half the area of the top and bottom faces, respectively. The middle faces are full area. The total surface area of the tower can be calculated as follows:
  \[
  \text{Total Surface Area} = 6 \times \sum_{k=0}^{6} \text{side}^2 - 2 \times \sum_{k=0}^{5} \text{side}^2
  \]
  Substituting the side lengths of the cubes, we get:
  \[
  \text{Total Surface Area} = 6 \times (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 + 7^2) - 2 \times (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2)
  \]
  Calculating the sums:
  \[
  1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 + 7^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 36 + 49 = 121
  \]
  \[
  1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 36 = 81
  \]
  Thus:
  \[
  \text{Total Surface Area} = 6 \times 121 - 2 \times 81 = 726 - 162 = 564
  \]
  However, this result does not match the expected surface area of \(658\). Let's re-evaluate the overlapping faces and the correct calculation.
