  To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total surface area of the tower formed by stacking the volumes of seven cubes with side lengths 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. The volume of each cube is given by the cube of its side length. The total surface area of the tower is the sum of the areas of all six faces of the cubes, excluding the base area.
  Given the side lengths of the cubes:
  - The volume of the cube with side length 1 is \(1^3 = 1\).
  - The volume of the cube with side length 2 is \(2^3 = 8\).
  - The volume of the cube with side length 3 is \(3^3 = 27\).
  - The volume of the cube with side length 4 is \(4^3 = 64\).
  - The volume of the cube with side length 5 is \(5^3 = 125\).
  - The volume of the cube with side length 6 is \(6^3 = 216\).
  - The volume of the cube with side length 7 is \(7^3 = 343\).
  The total surface area of the tower is calculated by summing the areas of all six faces of the cubes, excluding the base area. The area of the base face of each cube is not considered in this calculation.
