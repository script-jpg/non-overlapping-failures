  To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total surface area of the tower formed by stacking seven cubes with volumes 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, and 343 cubic units. The surface area of the tower can be calculated by summing the areas of the six lateral faces of each cube, considering that the bottom face of each cube lies completely on top of the cube below it.
  Given the volumes of the cubes, we can determine the side lengths of the cubes by taking the cube roots of the volumes. The side lengths are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 units respectively. The total surface area of the tower is calculated by summing the areas of the six lateral faces of each cube.
