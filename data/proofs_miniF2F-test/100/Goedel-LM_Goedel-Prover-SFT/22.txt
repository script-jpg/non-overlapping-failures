  To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total surface area of the tower formed by seven cubes with volumes \(1\), \(8\), \(27\), \(64\), \(125\), \(216\), and \(343\) cubic units. The cubes are stacked vertically, and the bottom face of each cube lies completely on top of the cube below it.
  First, we identify the side lengths of the cubes:
  - The first cube has a volume of \(1\), so its side length is \(1\).
  - The second cube has a volume of \(8\), so its side length is \(2\).
  - The third cube has a volume of \(27\), so its side length is \(3\).
  - The fourth cube has a volume of \(64\), so its side length is \(4\).
  - The fifth cube has a volume of \(125\), so its side length is \(5\).
  - The sixth cube has a volume of \(216\), so its side length is \(6\).
  - The seventh cube has a volume of \(343\), so its side length is \(7\).
  Next, we calculate the total surface area of the tower. The surface area of a cube with side length \(a\) is \(6a^2\). Therefore, the total surface area of the tower is the sum of the surface areas of all cubes:
  \[
  \text{Total Surface Area} = 6 \times (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 + 7^2)
  \]
  We then subtract the overlapping faces of the cubes. The overlapping faces are the top faces of the cubes, which are the squares of the side lengths:
  \[
  \text{Overlapping Faces} = 2 \times (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2)
  \]
  Finally, we verify that the total surface area equals \(658\):
  \[
  6 \times (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 + 7^2) - 2 \times (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2) = 658
  \]
