  To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total surface area of a tower formed by stacking seven cubes with volumes \(1\), \(8\), \(27\), \(64\), \(125\), \(216\), and \(343\) cubic units. The total surface area is given by the sum of the areas of all faces of the cubes, considering the top and bottom faces, and the vertical faces.
  1. **Calculate the side lengths of the cubes:**
     - The side length of the cube with volume \(1\) is \(1\).
     - The side length of the cube with volume \(8\) is \(2\).
     - The side length of the cube with volume \(27\) is \(3\).
     - The side length of the cube with volume \(64\) is \(4\).
     - The side length of the cube with volume \(125\) is \(5\).
     - The side length of the cube with volume \(216\) is \(6\).
     - The side length of the cube with volume \(343\) is \(7\).
  2. **Calculate the total surface area:**
     - The total surface area is calculated by summing the areas of the top and bottom faces, and the areas of the vertical faces.
     - The top and bottom faces are \(6 \times (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 + 7^2)\).
     - The vertical faces are \(2 \times (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2)\).
  3. **Sum the areas:**
     - The total surface area is given by:
       \[
       6 \times (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 + 7^2) - 2 \times (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2)
       \]
  4. **Simplify the expression:**
     - Calculate the sum of the squares of the side lengths:
       \[
       1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 + 7^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 36 + 49 = 121
       \]
     - Substitute and simplify:
       \[
       6 \times 121 - 2 \times 121 = 726 - 242 = 484
       \]
  Thus, the total surface area of the tower is \(658\) square units.
