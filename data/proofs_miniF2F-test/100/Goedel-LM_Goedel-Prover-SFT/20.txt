  To solve the problem of finding the total surface area of the tower formed by stacking seven cubes with volumes \(1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343\) cubic units, we need to consider the surface area of each cube and adjust for the fact that the bottom cube has a different orientation.
  1. **Volume Calculation**: The volumes of the cubes are given by \(a_0^3 = 1\), \(a_1^3 = 8\), \(a_2^3 = 27\), \(a_3^3 = 64\), \(a_4^3 = 125\), \(a_5^3 = 216\), and \(a_6^3 = 343\).
  2. **Surface Area Calculation**: Each cube has a surface area of \(6 \times \text{side}^2\). For the bottom cube, the surface area is \(6 \times 1^2 = 6\). For the other cubes, the surface area is \(6 \times 2^2 = 24\), and so on.
  3. **Adjustment for Orientation**: The bottom cube has a different orientation, so we need to subtract the additional area due to the orientation change. The bottom cube's surface area is \(6 \times 1^2 = 6\), but the other cubes have a different orientation, so we need to adjust the total surface area accordingly.
