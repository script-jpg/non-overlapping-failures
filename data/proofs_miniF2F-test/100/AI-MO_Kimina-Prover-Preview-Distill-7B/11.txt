The surface area of the cube with side $a$ is $6a^2$. We have a total of $7$ cubes with side lengths $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, $6$, $7$. The total surface area of all cubes is $\sum_{i=1}^7 6i^2 = 6 \sum_{i=1}^7 i^2 = 6\cdot\frac{7\cdot8\cdot15}{6} = 840$. 

However, the total surface area of the cubes in the tower is less than $840$. For every $i\geq 2$ there is a cube of side length $i-1$ on top of the cube of side length $i$. If the cube of side length $i$ is not on the bottom, then the cube of side length $i-1$ has $6-((i-1)^2 - (i^2 - 2(i-1))) = 6-((-i^2+4i-1) - (-2i+2)) = 6-(-i^2+6i-3) = i^2-6i+9 = (i-3)^2$ of its area hidden. The cube on the bottom has $6 - (1^2-2*1) = 6-(-1) = 7$ of its area hidden. Thus the total surface area of the cubes in the tower is $6\cdot 7^2 + 5^2 + 3^2 + 1^2 = 301 + 25 + 9 + 1 = 336$. 

The surface area of the tower itself is the surface area of the cubes in the tower minus the areas of the three squares where the cubes are joined. Each time except for the very bottom cube, the cubes on top of it have their top face hidden. So the total surface area of the tower is $336 - \sum_{i=2}^7 (i-3)^2 = 336 - 29 = \boxed{658}.$
