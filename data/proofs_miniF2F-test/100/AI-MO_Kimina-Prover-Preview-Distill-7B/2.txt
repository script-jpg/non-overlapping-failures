The problem involves calculating the total surface area of a tower formed by stacking seven cubes with given volumes. The cubes are stacked such that the volumes decrease from bottom to top, and each cube's bottom face lies completely on top of the cube below it. We need to find the total surface area, including the bottom.

First, let's determine the side lengths of the cubes. The volume of a cube is the cube of its side length. So we need to find the cube roots of the given volumes:

- $1^3 = 1$
- $2^3 = 8$
- $3^3 = 27$
- $4^3 = 64$
- $5^3 = 125$
- $6^3 = 216$
- $7^3 = 343$

Thus, the side lengths of the cubes are $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7$ units, respectively.

When the cubes are stacked, the surface area calculation must account for:
1. The exposed faces of each cube (excluding the bottom face, which is in contact with the cube below)
2. The overlap of the cubes, where the bottom face of each cube (except the bottom one) is in contact with the cube below, hiding some faces

For the total surface area:
- Each cube has 6 faces
- For a cube with side length $s$, the area of one face is $s^2$, so total surface area without overlap is $6s^2$
- In the tower, the bottom face of each cube (except the bottom one) is in contact with the cube below, hiding $s^2$ area on the top of each cube (for $i \in \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$)
- The bottom cube has its full $6 \cdot 1^2 = 6$ area exposed

So the calculation is:
- Area of bottom cube: $6 \cdot 1^2 = 6$
- For each cube $i \in \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$: $6 \cdot (a_i^2 - 1^2)$, where $a_i$ is the side length of cube $i$
- Sum over all cubes to get total area

Let's complete the Lean proof:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

```

Now we'll define the theorem statement with the given constraints:

```tactics
theorem amc12a_2020_p7 (a : ℕ → ℕ) (h₀ : a 0 ^ 3 = 1) (h₁ : a 1 ^ 3 = 8) (h₂ : a 2 ^ 3 = 27)
    (h₃ : a 3 ^ 3 = 64) (h₄ : a 4 ^ 3 = 125) (h₅ : a 5 ^ 3 = 216) (h₆ : a 6 ^ 3 = 343) :
    ↑(∑ k in Finset.range 7, 6 * (a (k ^ 2))) - ↑(2 * ∑ k in Finset.range 6, (a (k ^ 2))) = (658 : ℤ) := by
```

We need to prove that the expression equals 658. Let's compute the values of $a(0), a(1), \ldots, a(6)$ by determining the cube roots of the given numbers:

```tactics
have h₀ : a 0 = 1 := by
  -- cube root of 1 is 1
  rw [Nat.pow_left_injective (by norm_num) h₀]
have h₁ : a 1 = 2 := by
  -- cube root of 8 is 2
  rw [Nat.pow_left_injective (by norm_num) h₁]
have h₂ : a 2 = 3 := by
  -- cube root of 27 is 3
  rw [Nat.pow_left_injective (by norm_num) h₂]
have h₃ : a 3 = 4 := by
  -- cube root of 64 is 4
  rw [Nat.pow_left_injective (by norm_num) h₃]
have h₄ : a 4 = 5 := by
  -- cube root of 125 is 5
  rw [Nat.pow_left_injective (by norm_num) h₄]
have h₅ : a 5 = 6 := by
  -- cube root of 216 is 6
  rw [Nat.pow_left_injective (by norm_num) h₅]
have h₆ : a 6 = 7 := by
  -- cube root of 343 is 7
  rw [Nat.pow_left_injective (by norm_num) h₆]
```

Now we have all the values of $a(0)$ through $a(6)$. Next, we'll compute the sums in the goal:

The expression `∑ k in Finset.range 7, 6 * (a (k ^ 2))` represents the sum of $6 \cdot a(k^2)$ for $k = 0, 1, \ldots, 6$:
- $k = 0: 6 \cdot a(0^2) = 6 \cdot a(0) = 6 \cdot 1 = 6$
- $k = 1: 6 \cdot a(1^2) = 6 \cdot a(1) = 6 \cdot 2 = 12$
- $k = 2: 6 \cdot a(4) = 6 \cdot 3 = 18$
- $k = 3: 6 \cdot a(9) = 6 \cdot 4 = 24$
- $k = 4: 6 \cdot a(16) = 6 \cdot 5 = 30$
- $k = 5: 6 \cdot a(25) = 6 \cdot 6 = 36$
- $k = 6: 6 \cdot a(36) = 6 \cdot 7 = 42$
- Total: $6 + 12 + 18 + 24 + 30 + 36 + 42 = 168$

The expression `2 * ∑ k in Finset.range 6, (a (k ^ 2))` represents $2 \cdot \sum_{k=0}^{5} a(k^2)$:
- $k = 0: a(0) = 1$
- $k = 1: a(1) = 2$
- $k = 2: a(4) = 3$
- $k = 3: a(9) = 4$
- $k = 4: a(16) = 5$
- $k = 5: a(25) = 6$
- Sum: $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21$
- Total: $2 \cdot 21 = 42$

So the final result is $168 - 42 = 126$, but this doesn't match the expected answer of 658. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

The discrepancy suggests that our initial interpretation of the Lean goal is incorrect. Let's re-examine the problem statement and the Lean code.

The Lean goal is:
`↑(∑ k in Finset.range 7, 6 * (a (k ^ 2))) - ↑(2 * ∑ k in Finset.range 6, (a (k ^ 2))) = (658 : ℤ)`

This appears to compute:
- $\sum_{k=0}^{6} 6 \cdot a(k^2)$
- $2 \cdot \sum_{k=0}^{5} a(k^2)$
- Subtracting gives $658$

Let's compute these sums again with the correct interpretation:

$\sum_{k=0}^{6} 6 \cdot a(k^2)$:
- $k = 0: 6 \cdot a(0) = 6 \cdot 1 = 6$
- $k = 1: 6 \cdot a(1) = 6 \cdot 2 = 12$
- $k = 2: 6 \cdot a(4) = 6 \cdot 3 = 18$
- $k = 3: 6 \cdot a(9) = 6 \cdot 4 = 24$
- $k = 4: 6 \cdot a(16) = 6 \cdot 5 = 30$
- $k = 5: 6 \cdot a(25) = 6 \cdot 6 = 36$
- $k = 6: 6 \cdot a(36) = 6 \cdot 7 = 42$
- Total: $6 + 12 + 18 + 24 + 30 + 36 + 42 = 168$

$2 \cdot \sum_{k=0}^{5} a(k^2)$:
- $k = 0: a(0) = 1$
- $k = 1: a(1) = 2$
- $k = 2: a(4) = 3$
- $k = 3: a(9) = 4$
- $k = 4: a(16) = 5$
- $k = 5: a(25) = 6$
- Sum: $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21$
- Total: $2 \cdot 21 = 42$

$168 - 42 = 126 \neq 658$

The Lean goal cannot be correct as stated. There must be a misunderstanding of the problem or a mistake in the formalization.

Let's think about the problem again from first principles. When we stack cubes with decreasing volumes, the surface area calculation must account for:
1. The exposed faces of each cube (excluding the bottom face)
2. The overlap of the cubes

For each cube with side length $s$:
- Total surface area without overlap: $6s^2$
- In the tower, the bottom face is in contact with the cube below, hiding $s^2$ area on top
- So the exposed area is $5s^2$ per cube (except the bottom one, which has $6s^2$)

So the total area should be:
- $6 \cdot 7^2 + 5 \cdot (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2) = 6 \cdot 49 + 5 \cdot (1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 36) = 294 + 5 \cdot 91 = 294 + 455 = 749$

This still doesn't match the expected answer of 658. Let's consider another approach.

If we assume the Lean goal is correct, we need to compute:
`∑ k in Finset.range 7, 6 * (a (k ^ 2)) - 2 * ∑ k in Finset.range 6, (a (k ^ 2)) = 658`

Substituting the values:
- $6 \cdot a(0) + 6 \cdot a(1) + 6 \cdot a(4) + 6 \cdot a(9) + 6 \cdot a(16) + 6 \cdot a(25) + 6 \cdot a(36) - 2 \cdot (a(0) + a(1) + a(4) + a(9) + a(16) + a(25)) = 658$
- $6 \cdot 1 + 6 \cdot 2 + 6 \cdot 3 + 6 \cdot 4 + 6 \cdot 5 + 6 \cdot 6 + 6 \cdot 7 - 2 \cdot (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) = 658$
- $6 + 12 + 18 + 24 + 30 + 36 + 42 - 2 \cdot 21 = 658$
- $168 - 42 = 658$
- $126 = 658$

This is clearly false. The Lean goal is incorrect as stated. There's a fundamental misunderstanding of the problem in the formalization.

The correct answer, based on our calculation, should be $749$, not $658$. The Lean goal appears to have an error in the formula used to compute the total surface area.

Therefore, the Lean proof cannot be completed successfully because the goal is incorrect. The Lean code would need to be revised to correctly reflect the problem's surface area calculation.
