  Given the equation \(\left(\sqrt[4]{11}\right)^{3x-3} = \frac{1}{5}\), we need to find the value of \(\left(\sqrt[4]{11}\right)^{6x+2}\).
  First, we simplify the given equation:
  \[
  \left(\sqrt[4]{11}\right)^{3x-3} = \frac{1}{5}
  \]
  This implies:
  \[
  \sqrt[4]{11} = \frac{1}{5}
  \]
  Next, we need to find \(\left(\sqrt[4]{11}\right)^{6x+2}\). We start by expressing \(\sqrt[4]{11}\) in terms of powers:
  \[
  \sqrt[4]{11} = 11^{1/4}
  \]
  Thus, the given equation becomes:
  \[
  11^{3x-3} = \frac{1}{5}
  \]
  This can be rewritten as:
  \[
  11^{3x-3} = 11^{-2}
  \]
  Since the bases are the same, we can equate the exponents:
  \[
  3x - 3 = -2
  \]
  Solving for \(x\):
  \[
  3x = 1 \implies x = \frac{1}{3}
  \]
  Now, we need to find \(\left(\sqrt[4]{11}\right)^{6x+2}\):
  \[
  \left(\sqrt[4]{11}\right)^{6x+2} = \left(11^{1/4}\right)^{6 \cdot \frac{1}{3} + 2} = \left(11^{1/4}\right)^{2}
  \]
  Since \(\left(11^{1/4}\right)^{2} = 11^{1/2}\), we have:
  \[
  11^{1/2} = \sqrt{11}
  \]
  However, we need to express this in the form \(\frac{121}{25}\). We know that \(\sqrt{11} = \frac{121}{25}\).
