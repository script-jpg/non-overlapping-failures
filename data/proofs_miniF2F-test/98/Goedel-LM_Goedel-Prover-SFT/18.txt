  Given the equation \(\left(\sqrt[4]{11}\right)^{3x-3} = \frac{1}{5}\), we need to determine the value of \(\left(\sqrt[4]{11}\right)^{6x+2}\). We start by expressing the given equation in terms of exponents and simplifying.
  First, we rewrite the given equation:
  \[
  \left(\sqrt[4]{11}\right)^{3x-3} = \frac{1}{5}
  \]
  This can be rewritten as:
  \[
  \left(\sqrt[4]{11}\right)^{3x-3} = 11^{-3/4}
  \]
  Thus, we have:
  \[
  11^{-3/4} = \frac{1}{5}
  \]
  Next, we need to find the value of \(\left(\sqrt[4]{11}\right)^{6x+2}\). We can express this as:
  \[
  \left(\sqrt[4]{11}\right)^{6x+2} = 11^{3x+2}
  \]
  Since \(11^{-3/4} = \frac{1}{5}\), we can use this to find the relationship between \(11^{3x-3}\) and \(11^{3x+2}\).
  By simplifying the exponents, we see that:
  \[
  11^{3x+2} = 11^{3x-3} \cdot 11^5
  \]
  Given that \(11^{-3/4} = \frac{1}{5}\), we can solve for \(11^{3x-3}\) and then find \(11^{3x+2}\).
  Finally, we find that:
  \[
  11^{3x+2} = \frac{121}{25}
  \]
