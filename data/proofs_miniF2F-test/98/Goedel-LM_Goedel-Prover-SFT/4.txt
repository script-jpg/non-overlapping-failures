  Given that \(\left(\sqrt[4]{11}\right)^{3x-3}=\frac{1}{5}\), we need to find the value of \(\left(\sqrt[4]{11}\right)^{6x+2}\). We start by expressing the given equation in terms of powers of 11.
  First, we rewrite the given equation:
  \[
  \left(\sqrt[4]{11}\right)^{3x-3} = \frac{1}{5}
  \]
  This can be rewritten as:
  \[
  11^{3x-3} = \frac{1}{5}
  \]
  Next, we need to find the value of \(\left(\sqrt[4]{11}\right)^{6x+2}\). This can be rewritten as:
  \[
  11^{6x+2}
  \]
  We observe that:
  \[
  11^{6x+2} = \left(11^{3x-3}\right)^2
  \]
  Given \(11^{3x-3} = \frac{1}{5}\), we substitute this into the equation:
  \[
  \left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{25}
  \]
  Thus, the value of \(\left(\sqrt[4]{11}\right)^{6x+2}\) is:
  \[
  \frac{121}{25}
  \]

  -- Use the fact that 11^(3x-3) = 1/5 to solve for the target expression.
  -- We need to show that 11^(6x+2) = 121/25.
  -- This can be derived by expressing 11^(6x+2) as (11^(3x-3))^2 and substituting the given value.
