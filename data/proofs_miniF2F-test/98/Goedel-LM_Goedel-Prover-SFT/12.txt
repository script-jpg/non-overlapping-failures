  Given the equation \(\left(\sqrt[4]{11}\right)^{3x-3} = \frac{1}{5}\), we need to find the value of \(\left(\sqrt[4]{11}\right)^{6x+2}\). We start by expressing \(\left(\sqrt[4]{11}\right)^{6x+2}\) in terms of \(\left(\sqrt[4]{11}\right)^{3x-3}\). We use the properties of exponents to rewrite \(\left(\sqrt[4]{11}\right)^{6x+2}\) as \(\left(\left(\sqrt[4]{11}\right)^{3x-3}\right)^2\). Since \(\left(\sqrt[4]{11}\right)^{3x-3} = \frac{1}{5}\), we substitute this value into the expression, yielding \(\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{25}\). However, we need to show that \(\left(\sqrt[4]{11}\right)^{6x+2} = \frac{121}{25}\). This discrepancy suggests a need for further simplification or correction in the initial setup or assumptions.
