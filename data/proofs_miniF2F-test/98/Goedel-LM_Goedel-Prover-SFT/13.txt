  Given the equation \(\left(\sqrt[4]{11}\right)^{3x-3} = \frac{1}{5}\), we need to determine the value of \(\left(\sqrt[4]{11}\right)^{6x+2}\). We start by raising both sides of the given equation to the power of 2 to eliminate the fourth root. This results in \(\left(\sqrt[4]{11}\right)^{6x-6} = \frac{1}{25}\). By simplifying the exponents and using the properties of exponents, we can find the value of \(\left(\sqrt[4]{11}\right)^{6x+2}\).
