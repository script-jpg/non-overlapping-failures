  To show that for any positive natural number \( n \), \( n^{1/n} \leq 2 - 1/n \), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Base Case**: When \( n = 0 \), the inequality holds trivially because \( 0^{1/0} \) is undefined, and we can consider the limit as \( n \) approaches 0 from the right, which is still less than or equal to \( 2 - 1/0 \).
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the inequality holds for some \( n \). We need to show it holds for \( n + 1 \).
     - For \( n = 1 \), we have \( 1^{1/1} = 1 \), which is less than \( 2 - 1/1 = 1 \).
     - For \( n > 1 \), we use the fact that \( (n+1)^{1/(n+1)} \) can be bounded using properties of exponents and the fact that \( 1 < (n+1)^{1/(n+1)} < 2 - 1/(n+1) \).
