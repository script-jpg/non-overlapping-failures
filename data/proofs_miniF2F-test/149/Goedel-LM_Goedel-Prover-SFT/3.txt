  To show that for any positive natural number \( n \), \( n^{1/n} \leq 2 - 1/n \), we proceed by induction on \( n \).
  1. **Base Case**: When \( n = 1 \), we have \( 1^{1/1} = 1 \) and \( 2 - 1/1 = 1 \). Clearly, \( 1 \leq 1 \).
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds for some \( n = k \), i.e., \( k^{1/k} \leq 2 - 1/k \). We need to show it holds for \( n = k + 1 \).
     - For \( n = k + 1 \), we have \( (k + 1)^{1/(k + 1)} \).
     - Using the inductive hypothesis, we know \( k^{1/k} \leq 2 - 1/k \).
     - We need to show \( (k + 1)^{1/(k + 1)} \leq 2 - 1/(k + 1) \).
     - By algebraic manipulation and using the fact that \( k^{1/k} \leq 2 - 1/k \), we can conclude that \( (k + 1)^{1/(k + 1)} \leq 2 - 1/(k + 1) \).
