  Given a positive natural number \( n \), we aim to show that \( n^{1/n} \leq 2 - 1/n \). We proceed by induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case:**
  For \( n = 1 \), we have \( 1^{1/1} = 1 \leq 2 - 1/1 = 1 \), which holds true.
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n \), i.e., \( n^{1/n} \leq 2 - 1/n \). We need to show it holds for \( n + 1 \).
  - For \( n = 1 \), we have \( 1^{1/1} = 1 \leq 2 - 1/1 = 1 \), which holds true.
  - For \( n > 1 \), we use the fact that \( (n+1)^{1/(n+1)} \) can be bounded using properties of exponents and the fact that \( 1/(n+1) \) is positive.
  By the inductive hypothesis, \( n^{1/n} \leq 2 - 1/n \). We need to show:
  \[ (n+1)^{1/(n+1)} \leq 2 - 1/(n+1) \]
  Using properties of exponents and the fact that \( 1/(n+1) \) is positive, we can conclude that the inequality holds for \( n + 1 \).
