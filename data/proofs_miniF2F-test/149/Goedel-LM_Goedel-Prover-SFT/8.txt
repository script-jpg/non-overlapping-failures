  To show that for a positive natural number \( n \), \( n^{1/n} \leq 2 - 1/n \), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Base Case**: When \( n = 1 \), we have \( 1^{1/1} = 1 \) and \( 2 - 1/1 = 1 \). Clearly, \( 1 \leq 1 \).
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds for some \( n \). We need to show it holds for \( n + 1 \).
     - For \( n = 1 \), we have \( 1^{1/1} = 1 \) and \( 2 - 1/1 = 1 \). Clearly, \( 1 \leq 1 \).
     - For \( n > 1 \), we use the fact that \( n^{1/n} \leq 2 - 1/n \) and extend this to \( (n + 1)^{1/(n + 1)} \).
