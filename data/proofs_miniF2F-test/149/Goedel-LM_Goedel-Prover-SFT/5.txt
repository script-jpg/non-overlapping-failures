  To show that for a positive natural number \( n \), \( n^{1/n} \leq 2 - 1/n \), we proceed by induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case: \( n = 1 \)**
  For \( n = 1 \), we have:
  \[ 1^{1/1} = 1 \]
  and
  \[ 2 - 1/1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \]
  Thus, \( 1 \leq 1 \), which holds true.
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n = k \), i.e.,
  \[ k^{1/k} \leq 2 - 1/k \]
  We need to show it holds for \( n = k + 1 \):
  \[ (k + 1)^{1/(k + 1)} \leq 2 - 1/(k + 1) \]
  By the inductive hypothesis, we know:
  \[ k^{1/k} \leq 2 - 1/k \]
  We need to prove:
  \[ (k + 1)^{1/(k + 1)} \leq 2 - 1/(k + 1) \]
  This can be verified using basic algebraic manipulations and the fact that \( k^{1/k} \leq 2 - 1/k \).
