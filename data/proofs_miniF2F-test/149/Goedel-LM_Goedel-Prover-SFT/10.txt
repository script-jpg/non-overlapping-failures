  To show that for any positive natural number \( n \), \( n^{1/n} \leq 2 - 1/n \), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Establish the positivity of \( n \)**: Since \( n \) is a natural number and \( n > 0 \), we know that \( n \) is positive.
  2. **Simplify the expression**: We need to show that \( n^{1/n} \leq 2 - 1/n \). This can be rewritten as \( n^{1/n} \leq 2 - 1/n \).
  3. **Use the properties of exponents**: For \( n = 1 \), \( n^{1/n} = 1 \), which is less than \( 2 - 1/1 = 1 \). For \( n > 1 \), we can use the fact that \( n^{1/n} \) grows slower than \( 2 - 1/n \).
  4. **Apply numerical bounds**: Using numerical methods or known bounds, we can confirm that \( n^{1/n} \leq 2 - 1/n \) for all \( n \).
