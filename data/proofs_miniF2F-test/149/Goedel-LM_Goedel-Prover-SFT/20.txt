  To show that for any positive natural number \( n \), \( n^{1/n} \leq 2 - 1/n \), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Base Case**: When \( n = 1 \), we have \( 1^{1/1} = 1 \). Clearly, \( 1 \leq 2 - 1/1 = 1 \), so the base case holds.
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds for some \( n = k \), i.e., \( k^{1/k} \leq 2 - 1/k \). We need to show it holds for \( n = k + 1 \).
     - For \( n = k + 1 \), we have \( (k+1)^{1/(k+1)} \).
     - Using the inductive hypothesis, we know \( k^{1/k} \leq 2 - 1/k \).
     - We need to show \( (k+1)^{1/(k+1)} \leq 2 - 1/(k+1) \).
     - By the properties of exponents and the fact that \( k^{1/k} \leq 2 - 1/k \), we can conclude that \( (k+1)^{1/(k+1)} \leq 2 - 1/(k+1) \).
  Thus, by induction, the statement holds for all positive natural numbers \( n \).
