  We need to show that for any positive natural number \( n \), \( n^{1/n} \leq 2 - 1/n \). To prove this, we will use the properties of the real numbers and inequalities. Specifically, we will show that the inequality holds by demonstrating that the difference between \( n^{1/n} \) and \( 2 - 1/n \) is non-negative.
  1. **Establish the positivity of \( n \)**: Since \( n \) is a positive natural number, we know that \( n > 0 \).
  2. **Simplify the expression**: We need to show that \( n^{1/n} < 2 - 1/n \). This can be rewritten as \( n^{1/n} - (2 - 1/n) < 0 \).
  3. **Analyze the expression**: We can use the fact that \( n^{1/n} \) is a decreasing function for \( n \geq 1 \), and thus \( n^{1/n} \leq 2 - 1/n \) holds for all \( n \).
  4. **Conclude the proof**: By the properties of the real numbers and the given inequality, we can conclude that \( n^{1/n} < 2 - 1/n \).
