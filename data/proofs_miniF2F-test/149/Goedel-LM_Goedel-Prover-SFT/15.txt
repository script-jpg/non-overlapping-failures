  To show that for a positive natural number \( n \), \( n^{1/n} \leq 2 - 1/n \), we proceed by induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case:**
  For \( n = 1 \), we have \( 1^{1/1} = 1 \), which is trivially less than \( 2 - 1/1 = 1 \).
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n \). We need to show it holds for \( n + 1 \).
