  To show that for any positive natural number \( n \), \( n^{1/n} \leq 2 - 1/n \), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Base Case Analysis**: We start by analyzing the inequality for small values of \( n \).
  2. **Inductive Step**: Using the inductive hypothesis, we generalize the inequality to larger values of \( n \).
  3. **Numerical Verification**: Finally, we verify the inequality using numerical methods.
