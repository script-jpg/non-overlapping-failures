  We need to show that for a positive natural number \( n \), \( n^{1/n} \leq 2 - 1/n \). To do this, we will consider the inequality and simplify it step by step.
  1. Start with the inequality \( n^{1/n} \leq 2 - 1/n \).
  2. Simplify the left-hand side and the right-hand side of the inequality.
  3. Use algebraic manipulations to compare the two sides.
