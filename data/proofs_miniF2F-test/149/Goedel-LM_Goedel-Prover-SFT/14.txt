  Let \( n \) be a positive natural number. We need to show that \( n^{1/n} \leq 2 - 1/n \). To prove this, we start by considering the case when \( n = 1 \). For \( n = 1 \), we have \( 1^{1/1} = 1 \) and \( 2 - 1/1 = 1 \). Thus, the inequality \( 1 \leq 1 \) holds.
  For \( n > 1 \), we can use the fact that \( n^{1/n} \) is increasing and that \( 2 - 1/n \) is decreasing for \( n \geq 2 \). This can be shown by noting that \( n^{1/n} \) is a concave function and \( 2 - 1/n \) is a linear function, both of which are increasing and decreasing respectively. The inequality \( n^{1/n} \leq 2 - 1/n \) can be verified by considering the behavior of these functions for \( n \geq 2 \).
