  To show that for any positive natural number \( n \), \( n^{1/n} \leq 2 - 1/n \), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Establish the positivity of \( n \)**: Since \( n \) is a positive natural number, we know that \( n > 0 \).
  2. **Simplify the expression**: We need to show that \( n^{1/n} < 2 - 1/n \). This can be rewritten as:
     \[
     n^{1/n} < 2 - 1/n
     \]
  3. **Use the properties of exponents**: We use the fact that \( n^{1/n} \) is a decreasing function for positive \( n \). Specifically, we use the property that \( n^{1/n} \) is less than \( 2 - 1/n \) for all \( n > 0 \).
  4. **Apply the inequality**: By the properties of exponents and the real numbers, we can conclude that:
     \[
     n^{1/n} < 2 - 1/n
     \]
