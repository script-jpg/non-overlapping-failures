  To show that for a positive natural number \( n \), \( n^{1/n} \leq 2 - 1/n \), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Case Analysis**: We consider two cases for \( n \):
     - If \( n = 0 \), the statement is trivially true because \( 0^{1/0} \) is not defined in the real numbers.
     - If \( n \neq 0 \), we proceed to the inequality proof.
  2. **Inequality Manipulation**:
     - We start by simplifying the expression \( n^{1/n} \).
     - Using the properties of exponents and the fact that \( n \) is a positive natural number, we can derive the inequality \( n^{1/n} \leq 2 - 1/n \).
