  To show that for a positive natural number \( n \), \( n^{1/n} \leq 2 - 1/n \), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Base Case**: When \( n = 1 \), we have \( 1^{1/1} = 1 \), which is trivially less than \( 2 - 1/1 = 1 \).
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds for some \( n \). We need to show it holds for \( n + 1 \).
     - For \( n = 1 \), we have \( 1^{1/1} = 1 \), which is less than \( 2 - 1/1 = 1 \).
     - For \( n > 1 \), we use the fact that \( (n + 1)^{1/(n + 1)} \) can be bounded using properties of exponents and the fact that \( 1 < (n + 1)^{1/(n + 1)} < 2 \).
