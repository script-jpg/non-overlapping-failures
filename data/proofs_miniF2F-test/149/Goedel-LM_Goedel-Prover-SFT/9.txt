  To show that for any positive natural number \( n \), \( n^{1/n} \leq 2 - 1/n \), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Base Case**: When \( n = 1 \), we have \( 1^{1/1} = 1 \). Clearly, \( 1 \leq 2 - 1/1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \).
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds for some \( n = k \), i.e., \( k^{1/k} \leq 2 - 1/k \). We need to show it holds for \( n = k + 1 \).
     - For \( n = 1 \), we have \( 1^{1/1} = 1 \), which is trivially true.
     - For \( n > 1 \), we use the fact that \( (k + 1)^{1/(k + 1)} \) can be bounded using properties of exponents and the fact that \( 1/k \) is a decreasing function for \( k > 1 \).
