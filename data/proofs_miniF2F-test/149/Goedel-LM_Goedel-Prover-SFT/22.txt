  To show that for any positive natural number \( n \), \( n^{1/n} \leq 2 - 1/n \), we proceed by induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case: \( n = 1 \)**
  For \( n = 1 \), we have \( 1^{1/1} = 1 \) and \( 2 - 1/1 = 1 \). Clearly, \( 1 \leq 1 \), so the base case holds.
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n \), i.e., \( n^{1/n} \leq 2 - 1/n \). We need to show it holds for \( n + 1 \).
  Consider \( (n + 1)^{1/(n + 1)} \). By the properties of exponents, this can be rewritten as \( (n + 1)^{1/(n + 1)} = (n + 1)^{1/n + 1/n} \). Using the properties of exponents, this is equivalent to \( (n + 1)^{1/n} \cdot (n + 1)^{1/n} \).
  By the inductive hypothesis, \( n^{1/n} \leq 2 - 1/n \). Therefore, we have:
  \[ (n + 1)^{1/n} \leq 2 - 1/n \]
  Since \( (n + 1)^{1/n} \) is a positive number, we can multiply both sides by \( (n + 1)^{1/n} \) without changing the inequality direction:
  \[ (n + 1)^{1/n} \cdot (n + 1)^{1/n} \leq (2 - 1/n) \cdot (2 - 1/n) \]
  Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:
  \[ (2 - 1/n)^2 = 4 - 4/n + 1/n^2 \]
  Since \( 4 - 4/n + 1/n^2 \geq 4 \) for all \( n \), we have:
  \[ (n + 1)^{1/n} \cdot (n + 1)^{1/n} \leq 4 - 4/n + 1/n^2 \]
  Given that \( n^{1/n} \leq 2 - 1/n \), we can conclude that:
  \[ n^{1/n} \leq 2 - 1/n \]
  Thus, the inductive step holds, completing the proof.
