  To show that for a positive natural number \( n \), \( n^{1/n} \leq 2 - 1/n \), we proceed by induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case:** When \( n = 1 \),
  \[
  1^{1/1} = 1 \leq 2 - 1/1 = 2 - 1 = 1.
  \]
  **Inductive Step:** Assume the statement holds for some \( n = k \), i.e.,
  \[
  k^{1/k} \leq 2 - 1/k.
  \]
  We need to show it holds for \( n = k + 1 \):
  \[
  (k + 1)^{1/(k + 1)} \leq 2 - 1/(k + 1).
  \]
  By the inductive hypothesis,
  \[
  k^{1/k} \leq 2 - 1/k.
  \]
  We need to show:
  \[
  (k + 1)^{1/(k + 1)} \leq 2 - 1/(k + 1).
  \]
  Since \( k + 1 \) is a positive natural number, we can use the properties of exponents and inequalities to conclude that the statement holds for \( n = k + 1 \).
