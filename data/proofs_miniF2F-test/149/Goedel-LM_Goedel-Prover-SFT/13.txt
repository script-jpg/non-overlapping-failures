  To show that \( n^{1/n} \leq 2 - 1/n \) for a positive natural number \( n \), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Case 1**: \( n = 0 \)
     - This case is not possible since \( n \) is a natural number and we are considering its real counterpart.
  2. **Case 2**: \( n = 1 \)
     - Here, \( n^{1/n} = 1 \) and \( 2 - 1/1 = 1 \). Clearly, \( 1 \leq 1 \).
  3. **Case 3**: \( n \geq 2 \)
     - For \( n \geq 2 \), we use the fact that \( (n : ℝ) \) is a positive real number and apply basic inequalities to show that \( (n : ℝ) ^{1/n} \leq 2 - 1/n \).
