  To show that for any positive natural number \( n \), \( n^{1/n} \leq 2 - 1/n \), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Case Analysis**: We consider different cases for \( n \).
  2. **Base Case**: When \( n = 1 \), we have \( 1^{1/1} = 1 \) and \( 2 - 1/1 = 1 \). Thus, \( 1 \leq 1 \).
  3. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds for some \( n \). We need to show it holds for \( n + 1 \).
  4. **Simplification**: Using properties of exponents and division, we simplify the expressions.
  5. **Numerical Inequality**: We use numerical methods to verify the inequality.
