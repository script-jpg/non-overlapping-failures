  Given a positive natural number \( n \), we aim to show that \( n^{1/n} \leq 2 - 1/n \). The proof proceeds by induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case:**
  For \( n = 1 \), we have \( 1^{1/1} = 1 \), which is trivially less than \( 2 - 1/1 = 1 \).
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n = k \), i.e., \( k^{1/k} \leq 2 - 1/k \). We need to show it holds for \( n = k + 1 \).
  For \( n = k + 1 \), we have:
  \[
  (k + 1)^{1/(k + 1)} = k^{1/k} \cdot (k + 1)^{1/k - 1}
  \]
  By the inductive hypothesis, \( k^{1/k} \leq 2 - 1/k \). Using the fact that \( 1/(k + 1) < 1/k \), we get:
  \[
  (k + 1)^{1/(k + 1)} < (k + 1)^{1/k} \cdot (k + 1)^{1/k - 1} < (2 - 1/k) \cdot (k + 1)^{1/k - 1}
  \]
  Since \( (k + 1)^{1/k - 1} \) is a positive number, we can multiply the inequality:
  \[
  (2 - 1/k) \cdot (k + 1)^{1/k - 1} < 2 - 1/k
  \]
  Thus, we have shown that \( (k + 1)^{1/(k + 1)} \leq 2 - 1/(k + 1) \), completing the induction.
