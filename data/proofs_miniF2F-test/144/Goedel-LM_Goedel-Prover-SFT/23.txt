  Given a complex number \( z \) satisfying the equation \( 12|z|^2 = 2|z + 2|^2 + |z^2 + 1|^2 + 31 \), we need to determine the value of \( z + \frac{6}{z} \).
  1. **Normalization and Simplification**:
     - We start by simplifying the given equation using algebraic manipulations.
     - We use the properties of complex numbers and their norms to simplify the expressions.
  2. **Substitution and Simplification**:
     - We substitute specific values and simplify the expressions to find a pattern or relationship.
     - By simplifying the given equation, we derive that \( z + \frac{6}{z} = -2 \).
