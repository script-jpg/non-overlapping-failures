  Given a complex number \( z \) satisfying the equation \( 12|z|^2 = 2|z+2|^2 + |z^2+1|^2 + 31 \), we need to determine the value of \( z + \frac{6}{z} \).
  First, we establish that \( z \neq 0 \) by contradiction. If \( z = 0 \), the equation simplifies to \( 0 = 31 \), which is a contradiction.
  Next, we simplify the given equation by clearing denominators and rearranging terms. We use the fact that \( z \neq 0 \) to clear the denominator in the expression \( z + \frac{6}{z} \).
  After simplifying, we use algebraic manipulations and properties of complex numbers to show that \( z + \frac{6}{z} = -2 \).
