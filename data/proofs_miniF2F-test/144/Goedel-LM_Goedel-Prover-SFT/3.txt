  To solve the problem, we need to find a complex number \( z \) such that the given equation holds, and \( z + \frac{6}{z} = -2 \). We will show that \( z = -3 \) satisfies the given conditions.
  1. **Substitute \( z = -3 \) into the equation:**
     - Calculate \( |z| \) and \( |z + 2| \).
     - Verify that the equation holds.
  2. **Verify \( z + \frac{6}{z} = -2 \):**
     - Calculate \( z + \frac{6}{z} \) for \( z = -3 \).
