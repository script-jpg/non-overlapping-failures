  Given a complex number \( z \) satisfying the equation \( 12|z|^2 = 2|z+2|^2 + |z^2+1|^2 + 31 \), we need to determine the value of \( z + \frac{6}{z} \).
  First, we establish that \( z \neq 0 \) to avoid division by zero. This is done by showing that if \( z = 0 \), the equation \( 12|z|^2 = 2|z+2|^2 + |z^2+1|^2 + 31 \) does not hold.
  Next, we simplify the given equation using algebraic manipulations and properties of complex numbers. We use the fact that \( |z|^2 = z \overline{z} \) and similar properties for the other terms.
  Finally, we solve the resulting equation to find that \( z + \frac{6}{z} = -2 \).
