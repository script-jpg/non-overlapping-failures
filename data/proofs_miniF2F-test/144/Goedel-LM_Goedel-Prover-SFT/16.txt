theorem amc12b_2021_p18 (z : ℂ) (h₀ : 12 * Complex.normSq z = 2 * Complex.normSq (z + 2) + Complex.normSq (z ^ 2 + 1) + 31) :

  Given the complex number \( z \) satisfying the equation \( 12|z|^2 = 2|z+2|^2 + |z^2+1|^2 + 31 \), we need to find the value of \( z + \frac{6}{z} \).
  First, we establish that \( z \neq 0 \) to avoid division by zero. Then, we simplify the given equation by expanding and rearranging terms. After simplifying, we use the properties of complex numbers and algebraic manipulations to show that \( z + \frac{6}{z} = -2 \).
