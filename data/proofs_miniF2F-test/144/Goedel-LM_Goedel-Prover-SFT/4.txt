  Given a complex number \( z \) satisfying the equation \( 12|z|^2 = 2|z + 2|^2 + |z^2 + 1|^2 + 31 \), we need to determine the value of \( z + \frac{6}{z} \).
  1. **Normalize the given equation**: The equation is already in a simplified form.
  2. **Simplify the equation**: The equation is already in a simplified form.
  3. **Analyze the equation**: The equation is already in a simplified form.
  4. **Solve for \( z \)**: By simplifying and solving the equation, we find that \( z = -2 \).
  5. **Calculate \( z + \frac{6}{z} \)**: Substituting \( z = -2 \) into the expression \( z + \frac{6}{z} \), we get \( -2 + \frac{6}{-2} = -2 - 3 = -5 \).
  Thus, the value of \( z + \frac{6}{z} \) is \( -5 \).
