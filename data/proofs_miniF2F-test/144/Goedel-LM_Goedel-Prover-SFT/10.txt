theorem amc12b_2021_p18 (z : ℂ) (h₀ : 12 * Complex.normSq z = 2 * Complex.normSq (z + 2) + Complex.normSq (z ^ 2 + 1) + 31)

  Given a complex number \( z \) satisfying the equation \( 12|z|^2 = 2|z+2|^2 + |z^2+1|^2 + 31 \), we need to determine the value of \( z + \frac{6}{z} \).
  First, we simplify the given equation by expanding and rearranging terms. We then use the properties of complex numbers and their norms to further simplify the expression. Finally, we solve for \( z + \frac{6}{z} \) and find that it equals \(-2\).
