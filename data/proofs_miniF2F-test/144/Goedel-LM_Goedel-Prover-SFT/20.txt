  Given a complex number \( z \) satisfying the equation \( 12|z|^2 = 2|z+2|^2 + |z^2+1|^2 + 31 \), we need to determine the value of \( z + \frac{6}{z} \).
  First, we use the given equation to derive a relationship involving \( z \). By expanding and simplifying the equation, we can isolate terms involving \( z \) and its conjugate. This process involves algebraic manipulation and simplification of complex numbers.
  Next, we use the properties of complex numbers and their norms to further simplify the equation. We know that the norm of a complex number \( z \) is related to its real and imaginary parts. By expressing \( z \) in terms of its real and imaginary parts, we can simplify the equation to a form that can be solved for \( z \).
  Finally, we substitute the solution for \( z \) back into the expression \( z + \frac{6}{z} \) and verify that it equals \(-2\).
