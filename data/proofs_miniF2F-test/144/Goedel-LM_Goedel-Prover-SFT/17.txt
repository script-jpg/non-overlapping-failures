  Given a complex number \( z \) satisfying the equation \( 12|z|^2 = 2|z+2|^2 + |z^2+1|^2 + 31 \), we need to find the value of \( z + \frac{6}{z} \).
  1. **Normalization and Simplification**:
     - We start by normalizing the given equation using numerical simplification.
     - We use the properties of complex numbers and their norms to simplify the equation.
  2. **Algebraic Manipulation**:
     - We apply algebraic manipulations to the equation to isolate terms involving \( z \).
     - We use the fact that \( |z|^2 = z \cdot \overline{z} \) and similar properties for the other terms.
  3. **Simplification and Solving**:
     - We simplify the equation further to find a relationship between \( z \) and \( \frac{6}{z} \).
     - We use the properties of complex numbers and their norms to derive the final value of \( z + \frac{6}{z} \).
