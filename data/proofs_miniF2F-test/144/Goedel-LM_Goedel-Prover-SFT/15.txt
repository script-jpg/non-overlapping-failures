  Given a complex number \( z \) satisfying the equation \( 12|z|^2 = 2|z+2|^2 + |z^2 + 1|^2 + 31 \), we need to find the value of \( z + \frac{6}{z} \).
  First, we rewrite the given equation using the properties of the norm squared. We know that the norm squared of a complex number \( z \) is equal to \( |z|^2 \). Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:
  \[ 12|z|^2 = 2|z+2|^2 + |z^2 + 1|^2 + 31 \]
  Next, we simplify the equation by expanding and rearranging terms. We use the fact that the norm squared of a sum and a product of complex numbers can be expressed in terms of their individual norm squares.
  After simplifying, we find that \( z + \frac{6}{z} = -2 \).
