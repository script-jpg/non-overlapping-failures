  Given a complex number \( z \) satisfying the equation \( 12|z|^2 = 2|z+2|^2 + |z^2+1|^2 + 31 \), we need to find the value of \( z + \frac{6}{z} \).
  First, we rewrite the given equation in terms of norm squares. We then simplify and solve for \( z \) using algebraic manipulations and numerical checks. Finally, we verify that \( z + \frac{6}{z} = -2 \).
