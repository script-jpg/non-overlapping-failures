  Given a complex number \( z \) satisfying the equation \( 12|z|^2 = 2|z+2|^2 + |z^2+1|^2 + 31 \), we need to find the value of \( z + \frac{6}{z} \).
  First, we normalize the given equation by simplifying the norms and powers. We then use algebraic manipulations and properties of complex numbers to simplify the expression \( z + \frac{6}{z} \). Finally, we verify that the simplified expression equals \(-2\).
