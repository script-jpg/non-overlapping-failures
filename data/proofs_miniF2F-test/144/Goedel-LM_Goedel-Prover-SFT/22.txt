  Given a complex number \( z \) satisfying the equation \( 12|z|^2 = 2|z+2|^2 + |z^2+1|^2 + 31 \), we need to determine the value of \( z + \frac{6}{z} \).
  First, we express the given equation in terms of norms and simplify. We then use algebraic manipulation and properties of complex numbers to find the value of \( z + \frac{6}{z} \).
