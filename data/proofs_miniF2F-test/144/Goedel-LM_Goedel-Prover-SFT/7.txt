  Given a complex number \( z \) satisfying the equation \( 12|z|^2 = 2|z+2|^2 + |z^2 + 1|^2 + 31 \), we need to determine the value of \( z + \frac{6}{z} \).
  1. **Normalize the given equation**: We start by simplifying the given equation using properties of complex numbers and their norms.
  2. **Apply algebraic manipulations**: We use algebraic manipulations to express the equation in a more manageable form.
  3. **Simplify the equation**: We simplify the equation by considering the real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers involved.
  4. **Solve for \( z \)**: We solve the simplified equation to find the value of \( z \).
  5. **Verify the solution**: Finally, we verify that the solution satisfies the original equation.
