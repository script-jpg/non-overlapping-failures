  Given a complex number \( z \) satisfying the equation \( 12|z|^2 = 2|z+2|^2 + |z^2+1|^2 + 31 \), we need to determine the value of \( z + \frac{6}{z} \).
  First, we simplify the given equation by expanding and rearranging terms. We use the properties of complex numbers and their norms. By manipulating the given equation, we can isolate and solve for \( z \).
  Next, we substitute the solution for \( z \) back into the expression \( z + \frac{6}{z} \) and simplify to find the final value.
