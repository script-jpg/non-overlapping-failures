  Given a complex number \( z \) satisfying the equation \( 12|z|^2 = 2|z + 2|^2 + |z^2 + 1|^2 + 31 \), we need to determine the value of \( z + \frac{6}{z} \).
  First, we simplify the given equation by expanding and rearranging terms. We then use algebraic manipulations and properties of complex numbers to find the value of \( z + \frac{6}{z} \).
