  Given a complex number \( z \) satisfying the equation \( 12|z|^2 = 2|z+2|^2 + |z^2+1|^2 + 31 \), we need to find the value of \( z + \frac{6}{z} \).
  First, we simplify the given equation by expressing the norms in terms of the real and imaginary parts. We then use algebraic manipulations and inequalities to derive the value of \( z + \frac{6}{z} \).
