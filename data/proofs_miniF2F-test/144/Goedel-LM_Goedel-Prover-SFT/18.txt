  Given a complex number \( z \) satisfying the equation \( 12|z|^2 = 2|z + 2|^2 + |z^2 + 1|^2 + 31 \), we need to determine the value of \( z + \frac{6}{z} \).
  1. **Normalize the given equation**: Simplify the equation using properties of complex numbers.
  2. **Simplify the equation**: Use algebraic manipulations to simplify the equation.
  3. **Solve for \( z \)**: Use numerical methods or algebraic manipulations to find the value of \( z \).
  4. **Verify the solution**: Check that the found value of \( z \) satisfies the original equation.
  5. **Calculate \( z + \frac{6}{z} \)**: Substitute the found value of \( z \) into the expression \( z + \frac{6}{z} \) and simplify.
