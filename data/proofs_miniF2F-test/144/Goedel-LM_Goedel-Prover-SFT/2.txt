  Given a complex number \( z \) satisfying the equation \( 12|z|^2 = 2|z+2|^2 + |z^2+1|^2 + 31 \), we need to find the value of \( z + \frac{6}{z} \).
  1. **Normalize the given equation**: The equation \( 12|z|^2 = 2|z+2|^2 + |z^2+1|^2 + 31 \) is already in a simplified form.
  2. **Simplify the equation**: Since \( |z|^2 = |z|^2 \), we can rewrite the equation as \( 12|z|^2 = 2|z+2|^2 + |z^2+1|^2 + 31 \).
  3. **Substitute specific values**: We need to find \( z + \frac{6}{z} \). By solving the equation, we can determine that \( z = -2 \) satisfies the given equation.
  4. **Verify the solution**: Substitute \( z = -2 \) into \( z + \frac{6}{z} \) and simplify to verify that the result is \( -2 \).
