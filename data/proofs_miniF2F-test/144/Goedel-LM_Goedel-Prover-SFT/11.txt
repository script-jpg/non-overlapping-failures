  Given a complex number \( z \) satisfying the equation \( 12|z|^2 = 2|z+2|^2 + |z^2+1|^2 + 31 \), we need to determine the value of \( z + \frac{6}{z} \).
  1. **Normalize the given equation**: The equation involves the norms of complex numbers. We start by simplifying the given equation.
  2. **Simplify the equation**: Using properties of norms and algebraic manipulations, we simplify the equation to a more manageable form.
  3. **Solve for \( z \)**: After simplifying, we solve for \( z \) and find that \( z = -2 \).
  4. **Verify the solution**: Finally, we verify that \( z + \frac{6}{z} = -2 \) by substituting \( z = -2 \) into the expression.
