  Given a complex number \( z \) satisfying the equation \( 12|z|^2 = 2|z+2|^2 + |z^2+1|^2 + 31 \), we need to find the value of \( z + \frac{6}{z} \).
  First, we establish that \( z \neq 0 \) by contradiction. If \( z = 0 \), the equation simplifies to \( 12 = 31 \), which is a contradiction.
  Next, we simplify the given equation by clearing denominators using \( z \neq 0 \). We then expand and simplify the equation using algebraic identities. Finally, we use numerical and algebraic properties to solve for \( z + \frac{6}{z} \), which simplifies to \(-2\).
