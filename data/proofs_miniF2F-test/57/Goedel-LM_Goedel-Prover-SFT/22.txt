    Given integers \( p, q, r \) such that \( 1 < p < q < r \), we need to show that if \( (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) \) divides \( pqr - 1 \), then \( (p, q, r) \) must be either \( (2, 4, 8) \) or \( (3, 5, 15) \).
  To prove this, we start by considering the given conditions and the properties of divisibility. We use the fact that \( (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) \) divides \( pqr - 1 \) to derive the possible values for \( p, q, \) and \( r \).
