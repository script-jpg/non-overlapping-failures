  Given integers \( p, q, r \) such that \( 1 < p < q < r \), we need to show that if \( (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) \) divides \( pqr - 1 \), then \( (p, q, r) \) must be either \( (2, 4, 8) \) or \( (3, 5, 15) \).
  1. **Normalization and Simplification**:
     - We start by normalizing the given conditions using basic arithmetic operations.
     - The divisibility condition is simplified to a modular equivalence.
  2. **Case Analysis**:
     - We analyze the possible values of \( p, q, r \) under the given constraints.
     - By considering the divisibility condition and the constraints, we deduce that the only possible solutions are \( (p, q, r) = (2, 4, 8) \) and \( (p, q, r) = (3, 5, 15) \).
