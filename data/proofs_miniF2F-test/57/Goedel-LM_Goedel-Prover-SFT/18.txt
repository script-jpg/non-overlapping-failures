  Given integers \( p, q, r \) such that \( 1 < p < q < r \), we need to show that if \( (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) \) divides \( pqr - 1 \), then \( (p, q, r) = (2, 4, 8) \) or \( (p, q, r) = (3, 5, 15) \).
  1. **Normalization and Simplification**:
     - We start by normalizing the given conditions and simplifying the expressions.
     - The conditions include the inequalities \( 1 < p < q < r \) and the divisibility condition \( (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) \mid pqr - 1 \).
  2. **Verification of Specific Cases**:
     - We verify that the cases \( (p, q, r) = (2, 4, 8) \) and \( (p, q, r) = (3, 5, 15) \) satisfy the given conditions.
     - For each case, we check the inequalities and the divisibility condition.
  3. **Conclusion**:
     - By checking the conditions for the specific cases, we conclude that the only solutions are \( (p, q, r) = (2, 4, 8) \) and \( (p, q, r) = (3, 5, 15) \).
