  Given integers \( p, q, r \) such that \( 1 < p < q < r \), we need to show that if \( (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) \) divides \( pqr - 1 \), then \( (p, q, r) \) must be either \( (2, 4, 8) \) or \( (3, 5, 15) \).
  1. **Normalization and Simplification**: We start by normalizing the given conditions using basic arithmetic operations.
  2. **Divisibility Condition**: We use the given divisibility condition \( (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) \mid pqr - 1 \) to derive further constraints.
  3. **Range Constraints**: We apply the constraints on \( p, q, \) and \( r \) to narrow down the possible values.
  4. **Verification**: We verify that the only solutions to the given conditions are \( (p, q, r) = (2, 4, 8) \) and \( (p, q, r) = (3, 5, 15) \).
