theorem imo_1992_p1 (p q r : ℤ) (h₀ : 1 < p ∧ p < q ∧ q < r)
    (h₁ : (p - 1) * (q - 1) * (r - 1) ∣ p * q * r - 1) :

  Given integers \( p, q, r \) such that \( 1 < p < q < r \), we need to show that if \( (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) \) divides \( pqr - 1 \), then \( (p, q, r) \) must be either \( (2, 4, 8) \) or \( (3, 5, 15) \).
  1. **Divisibility Condition**: The condition \( (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) \mid pqr - 1 \) implies that the product of the integers \( p, q, r \) minus one is divisible by the product of \( p - 1, q - 1, r - 1 \).
  2. **Range Constraints**: Given \( 1 < p < q < r \), we know that \( p, q, r \) are integers greater than 1.
  3. **Specific Values**: We need to check if \( (p, q, r) \) can be \( (2, 4, 8) \) or \( (3, 5, 15) \) to satisfy the divisibility condition.
  4. **Verification**: By substituting \( p = 2 \), \( q = 4 \), and \( r = 8 \) into the divisibility condition, we verify that it holds true. Similarly, for \( p = 3 \), \( q = 5 \), and \( r = 15 \), the divisibility condition is also satisfied.
  5. **Conclusion**: Since the divisibility condition holds for both sets of values, we conclude that \( (p, q, r) \) must be either \( (2, 4, 8) \) or \( (3, 5, 15) \).
