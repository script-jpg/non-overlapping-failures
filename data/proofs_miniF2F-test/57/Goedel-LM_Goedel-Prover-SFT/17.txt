  Given integers \( p, q, r \) such that \( 1 < p < q < r \), we need to show that if \( (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) \) divides \( pqr - 1 \), then \( (p, q, r) \) must be either \( (2, 4, 8) \) or \( (3, 5, 15) \).
  To prove this, we start by considering the given condition \( (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) \mid pqr - 1 \). This implies that the product of the three numbers \( (p - 1), (q - 1), (r - 1) \) divides \( pqr - 1 \).
  We will check the possible values of \( p, q, r \) that satisfy the given conditions and verify that only \( (2, 4, 8) \) and \( (3, 5, 15) \) satisfy the divisibility condition.
