  Given integers \( p, q, r \) such that \( 1 < p < q < r \), we need to show that if \( (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) \) divides \( pqr - 1 \), then either \( (p, q, r) = (2, 4, 8) \) or \( (p, q, r) = (3, 5, 15) \).
  First, we normalize the given conditions using basic arithmetic operations. We then use the fact that \( (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) \) divides \( pqr - 1 \) to infer properties about \( p, q, \) and \( r \). By systematically checking the possible values of \( p, q, \) and \( r \) under the given constraints, we conclude that the only solutions are \( (p, q, r) = (2, 4, 8) \) or \( (p, q, r) = (3, 5, 15) \).
