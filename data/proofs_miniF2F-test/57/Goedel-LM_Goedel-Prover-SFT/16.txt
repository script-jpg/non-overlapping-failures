  Given integers \( p, q, r \) such that \( 1 < p < q < r \), we need to show that if \( (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) \) divides \( pqr - 1 \), then \( (p, q, r) \) must be either \( (2, 4, 8) \) or \( (3, 5, 15) \).
  1. **Normalization and Simplification**:
     - We start by normalizing the given conditions and simplifying the expressions.
     - The divisibility condition \( (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) \mid pqr - 1 \) is simplified using numerical normalization.
  2. **Case Analysis**:
     - We perform a case analysis on the possible values of \( p, q, \) and \( r \).
     - Given the constraints \( 1 < p < q < r \), we check the possible values that satisfy the divisibility condition.
  3. **Verification**:
     - We verify that the only values that satisfy the divisibility condition are \( (2, 4, 8) \) and \( (3, 5, 15) \).
