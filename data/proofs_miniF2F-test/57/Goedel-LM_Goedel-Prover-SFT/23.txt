  Given integers \( p, q, r \) such that \( 1 < p < q < r \), we need to show that if \( (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) \) divides \( pqr - 1 \), then \( (p, q, r) \) must be either \( (2, 4, 8) \) or \( (3, 5, 15) \).
  To prove this, we start by assuming the given conditions and using the provided divisibility condition. We then simplify the divisibility condition and use algebraic manipulations to derive the possible values for \( p, q, \) and \( r \).
