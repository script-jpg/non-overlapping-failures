  Given integers \( p, q, r \) such that \( 1 < p < q < r \), we need to show that if \( (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) \) divides \( pqr - 1 \), then \( (p, q, r) \) must be either \( (2, 4, 8) \) or \( (3, 5, 15) \).
  1. **Normalization and Simplification**:
     - We start by normalizing the given conditions and simplifying the expressions.
     - We use the fact that \( (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) \) divides \( pqr - 1 \) to derive the necessary conditions.
  2. **Case Analysis**:
     - We perform a case analysis on the possible values of \( p, q, r \) and check if they satisfy the given conditions.
     - Specifically, we check if \( p = 2 \), \( q = 4 \), and \( r = 8 \) or \( p = 3 \), \( q = 5 \), and \( r = 15 \).
  3. **Verification**:
     - For each set of values, we verify if they satisfy the conditions \( 1 < p < q < r \) and the divisibility condition \( (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) \mid pqr - 1 \).
     - By checking each set, we find that only \( (2, 4, 8) \) and \( (3, 5, 15) \) satisfy all conditions.
  Thus, the solution is \( (p, q, r) = (2, 4, 8) \) or \( (p, q, r) = (3, 5, 15) \).
