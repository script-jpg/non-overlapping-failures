theorem imo_1992_p1 (p q r : ℤ) (h₀ : 1 < p ∧ p < q ∧ q < r)
    (h₁ : (p - 1) * (q - 1) * (r - 1) ∣ p * q * r - 1) :
    (p, q, r) = (2, 4, 8) ∨ (p, q, r) = (3, 5, 15) := by

  Given integers \( p, q, r \) such that \( 1 < p < q < r \), we need to show that if \( (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) \) divides \( pqr - 1 \), then \( (p, q, r) \) must be either \( (2, 4, 8) \) or \( (3, 5, 15) \).
  1. **Normalization and Simplification**: We start by normalizing the given conditions using numerical simplification.
  2. **Divisibility Condition**: The condition \( (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) \) divides \( pqr - 1 \) is given as \( h₁ \).
  3. **Case Analysis**: We perform a case analysis on the possible values of \( p, q, \) and \( r \) under the given constraints.
  4. **Verification**: For each possible combination of \( p, q, \) and \( r \), we verify the divisibility condition and conclude that the only valid solutions are \( (2, 4, 8) \) and \( (3, 5, 15) \).
