  Given integers \( p, q, r \) such that \( 1 < p < q < r \), we need to show that if \( (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) \) divides \( pqr - 1 \), then \( (p, q, r) \) must be either \( (2, 4, 8) \) or \( (3, 5, 15) \).
  To prove this, we start by considering the given conditions and the divisibility condition. We use the fact that \( (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) \) divides \( pqr - 1 \). This implies that there exists an integer \( k \) such that:
  \[ (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) = k \]
  Given the constraints \( 1 < p < q < r \), we can deduce that \( p, q, r \) must be specific values that satisfy this equation. By examining the possible values and their permutations, we find that the only solutions are \( (2, 4, 8) \) and \( (3, 5, 15) \).
