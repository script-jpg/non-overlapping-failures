  Given integers \( p, q, r \) such that \( 1 < p < q < r \), we need to show that if \( (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) \) divides \( pqr - 1 \), then \( (p, q, r) \) must be either \( (2, 4, 8) \) or \( (3, 5, 15) \).
  First, we normalize the given conditions using basic arithmetic operations. Then, we use the fact that \( (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) \) divides \( pqr - 1 \) to derive the specific values of \( p, q, \) and \( r \).
