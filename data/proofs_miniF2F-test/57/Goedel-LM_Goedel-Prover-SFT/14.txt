  Given integers \( p, q, r \) such that \( 1 < p < q < r \), we need to show that if \( (p - 1)(q - 1)(r - 1) \) divides \( pqr - 1 \), then \( (p, q, r) \) must be either \( (2, 4, 8) \) or \( (3, 5, 15) \).
  1. **Normalization and Simplification**:
     - We start by normalizing the given conditions using basic arithmetic operations.
     - Specifically, we use the fact that \( p, q, r \) are positive integers and the given divisibility condition.
  2. **Verification of Specific Cases**:
     - We verify that the only solutions satisfying the given conditions are \( (2, 4, 8) \) and \( (3, 5, 15) \).
     - This involves checking the divisibility condition for these values and ensuring that no other values satisfy the condition within the specified range.
