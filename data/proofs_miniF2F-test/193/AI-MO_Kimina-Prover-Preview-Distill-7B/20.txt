In this proof, we're calculating $f(f(1))$ where $f(x) = \frac{1}{x+2}$. 

1. First, we find $f(1)$:
   - $f(1) = \frac{1}{1+2} = \frac{1}{3}$

2. Then we find $f(f(1)) = f\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)$:
   - $f\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{3} + 2} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{3} + \frac{6}{3}} = \frac{1}{\frac{7}{3}} = \frac{3}{7}$

So $f(f(1)) = \frac{3}{7}$, which matches the boxed answer. The Lean proof carefully follows these steps, using the definition of $f$ and basic algebraic manipulations to arrive at the final result.
