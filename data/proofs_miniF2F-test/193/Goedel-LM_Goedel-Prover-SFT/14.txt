  To solve for \( f(f(1)) \) where \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x + 2} \), we proceed as follows:
  1. First, compute \( f(1) \):
     \[
     f(1) = \frac{1}{1 + 2} = \frac{1}{3}
     \]
  2. Next, compute \( f(f(1)) = f\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \):
     \[
     f\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{3} + 2} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{3} + \frac{6}{3}} = \frac{1}{\frac{7}{3}} = \frac{3}{7}
     \]
  Thus, \( f(f(1)) = \frac{3}{7} \).
