  Given the mean scores of the morning and afternoon classes, and the ratio of the number of students in each class, we need to find the mean score of all students. The mean score of the morning class is 84, and the mean score of the afternoon class is 70. The ratio of the number of students in the morning class to the number of students in the afternoon class is 3/4. We are given that the mean score of all students is 76. We need to verify this by calculating the weighted average of the mean scores of the morning and afternoon classes, given the ratio of the number of students in each class.
