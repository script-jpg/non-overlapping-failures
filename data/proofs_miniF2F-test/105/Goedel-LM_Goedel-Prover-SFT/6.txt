  Given that the mean score of students in the morning class is 84, and the mean score of students in the afternoon class is 70, and the ratio of the number of students in the morning class to the number of students in the afternoon class is \(\frac{3}{4}\), we need to find the mean score of all students.
  
  First, we express the ratio of the number of students in the morning class to the number of students in the afternoon class as \(\frac{m}{a} = \frac{3}{4}\). This implies that \(4m = 3a\).
  
  Next, we calculate the total score for all students. The total score for the morning class is \(84m\), and for the afternoon class is \(70a\). Therefore, the total score for all students is \(84m + 70a\).
  
  The total number of students is \(m + a\).
  
  To find the mean score of all students, we divide the total score by the total number of students:
  \[
  \text{Mean score} = \frac{84m + 70a}{m + a}
  \]
  
  Using the relationship \(4m = 3a\), we substitute \(a\) in terms of \(m\):
  \[
  a = \frac{4m}{3}
  \]
  
  Substituting \(a\) into the mean score formula, we get:
  \[
  \text{Mean score} = \frac{84m + 70 \left(\frac{4m}{3}\right)}{m + \frac{4m}{3}} = \frac{84m + \frac{280m}{3}}{\frac{7m}{3}} = \frac{84m + \frac{280m}{3}}{\frac{7m}{3}} = \frac{252m + 280m}{7m} = \frac{532m}{7m} = 76
  \]
  
  Thus, the mean score of all students is 76.
