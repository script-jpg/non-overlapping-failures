  Given the mean scores of students in the morning and afternoon classes, and the ratio of the number of students in these classes, we need to find the mean score of all students. The mean score of the morning class is 84, and the mean score of the afternoon class is 70. The ratio of the number of students in the morning class to the number of students in the afternoon class is \(\frac{3}{4}\).
  To find the mean score of all students, we use the formula for the weighted average:
  \[
  \text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Mean of morning class} \cdot \text{Number of morning students} + \text{Mean of afternoon class} \cdot \text{Number of afternoon students}}{\text{Total number of students}}
  \]
  Given the ratio \(\frac{m}{a} = \frac{3}{4}\), we can express the number of morning students \(m\) in terms of the number of afternoon students \(a\):
  \[
  m = \frac{3}{4}a
  \]
  Substituting this into the weighted average formula, we get:
  \[
  \text{Mean} = \frac{84 \cdot \frac{3}{4}a + 70 \cdot a}{\frac{3}{4}a + a}
  \]
  Simplifying the numerator:
  \[
  84 \cdot \frac{3}{4}a + 70 \cdot a = 84 \cdot \frac{3}{4}a + 70 \cdot a = 84 \cdot \frac{3}{4}a + 70 \cdot a = 70 \cdot a + 84 \cdot \frac{3}{4}a = 70a + 63a = 133a
  \]
  Simplifying the denominator:
  \[
  \frac{3}{4}a + a = \frac{3}{4}a + \frac{4}{4}a = \frac{7}{4}a
  \]
  Thus, the mean score of all students is:
  \[
  \text{Mean} = \frac{133a}{\frac{7}{4}a} = \frac{133a \cdot 4}{7a} = \frac{532a}{7a} = \frac{532}{7} \approx 76
  \]
