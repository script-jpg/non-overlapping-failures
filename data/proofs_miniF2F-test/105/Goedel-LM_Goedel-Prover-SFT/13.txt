  Given that the mean score of the morning class is 84 and the mean score of the afternoon class is 70, and the ratio of the number of students in the morning class to the number of students in the afternoon class is 3/4, we need to find the mean score of all students.
  Let \( m \) be the number of students in the morning class and \( a \) be the number of students in the afternoon class. We are given that \( \frac{m}{a} = \frac{3}{4} \).
  First, we express \( m \) in terms of \( a \) using the given ratio:
  \[ m = \frac{3}{4} a \]
  Next, we substitute this expression into the formula for the mean score of all students:
  \[ \text{Mean score} = \frac{84m + 70a}{m + a} \]
  Substituting \( m = \frac{3}{4} a \) into the formula, we get:
  \[ \text{Mean score} = \frac{84 \left( \frac{3}{4} a \right) + 70a}{\frac{3}{4} a + a} \]
  Simplifying the numerator and the denominator:
  \[ \text{Numerator} = 84 \left( \frac{3}{4} a \right) + 70a = 63a + 70a = 133a \]
  \[ \text{Denominator} = \frac{3}{4} a + a = \frac{3}{4} a + \frac{4}{4} a = \frac{7}{4} a \]
  Thus, the mean score is:
  \[ \text{Mean score} = \frac{133a}{\frac{7}{4} a} = \frac{133a \cdot 4}{7a} = \frac{532a}{7a} = \frac{532}{7} = 76 \]
  Therefore, the mean score of all students is 76.
