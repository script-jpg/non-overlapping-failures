  Given the means of scores for morning and afternoon classes are 84 and 70 respectively, and the ratio of the number of students in the morning class to the number of students in the afternoon class is \(\frac{3}{4}\), we need to find the mean of the scores of all students.
  Let \( m \) be the number of students in the morning class and \( a \) be the number of students in the afternoon class. According to the given ratio, \( \frac{m}{a} = \frac{3}{4} \).
  First, we express \( m \) in terms of \( a \) using the ratio:
  \[ m = \frac{3}{4} a \]
  Next, we calculate the total score for all students:
  \[ \text{Total score} = 84m + 70a \]
  Substituting \( m = \frac{3}{4} a \) into the total score equation:
  \[ \text{Total score} = 84 \left( \frac{3}{4} a \right) + 70a \]
  \[ \text{Total score} = 63a + 70a \]
  \[ \text{Total score} = 133a \]
  Now, we find the mean score by dividing the total score by the total number of students:
  \[ \text{Mean score} = \frac{\text{Total score}}{m + a} \]
  Substituting \( m = \frac{3}{4} a \) and \( \text{Total score} = 133a \):
  \[ \text{Mean score} = \frac{133a}{\frac{3}{4} a + a} \]
  \[ \text{Mean score} = \frac{133a}{\frac{7}{4} a} \]
  \[ \text{Mean score} = \frac{133a \cdot 4}{7a} \]
  \[ \text{Mean score} = \frac{532a}{7a} \]
  \[ \text{Mean score} = 76 \]
  Thus, the mean of the scores of all students is 76.
