  Given the mean scores of students in the morning and afternoon classes, and the ratio of the number of students in these classes, we need to find the mean score of all students. The mean score of the morning class is 84, and the mean score of the afternoon class is 70. The ratio of the number of students in the morning class to the number of students in the afternoon class is \(\frac{3}{4}\).
  To find the mean score of all students, we calculate the total score of all students by multiplying the mean scores by the number of students in each class and summing these products. We then divide the total score by the total number of students to find the mean score.
  Given:
  - Mean score of morning class: 84
  - Mean score of afternoon class: 70
  - Ratio of number of students: \(\frac{m}{a} = \frac{3}{4}\)
  The total score of all students is:
  \[ 84m + 70a \]
  The total number of students is:
  \[ m + a \]
  Thus, the mean score of all students is:
  \[ \frac{84m + 70a}{m + a} \]
  Using the given ratio \(\frac{m}{a} = \frac{3}{4}\), we can express \(m\) in terms of \(a\):
  \[ m = \frac{3}{4}a \]
  Substituting \(m = \frac{3}{4}a\) into the mean score formula:
  \[ \frac{84 \left(\frac{3}{4}a\right) + 70a}{\frac{3}{4}a + a} = \frac{84 \cdot \frac{3}{4}a + 70a}{\frac{3}{4}a + a} = \frac{63a + 70a}{\frac{3}{4}a + a} = \frac{133a}{\frac{7}{4}a} = \frac{133a \cdot 4}{7a} = \frac{532a}{7a} = 532 \cdot \frac{1}{7} = 76 \]
  Therefore, the mean score of all students is 76.
