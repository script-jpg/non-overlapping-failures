  To solve the problem, we start by using the given ratio of the number of students in the morning class to the number of students in the afternoon class, which is \(\frac{3}{4}\). We then use the mean scores of the students in each class to find the total mean score.
  Given:
  - The mean score of the morning class is 84.
  - The mean score of the afternoon class is 70.
  - The ratio of the number of students in the morning class to the number of students in the afternoon class is \(\frac{3}{4}\).
  We need to find the mean score of all students, which is given by the formula:
  \[
  \text{mean} = \frac{84m + 70a}{m + a}
  \]
  where \(m\) is the number of students in the morning class and \(a\) is the number of students in the afternoon class.
  From the given ratio, we have:
  \[
  \frac{m}{a} = \frac{3}{4}
  \]
  This implies:
  \[
  m = \frac{3}{4}a
  \]
  Substituting \(m = \frac{3}{4}a\) into the mean formula:
  \[
  \text{mean} = \frac{84 \left(\frac{3}{4}a\right) + 70a}{\frac{3}{4}a + a}
  \]
  Simplifying the numerator:
  \[
  84 \left(\frac{3}{4}a\right) + 70a = 84 \cdot \frac{3}{4}a + 70a = 63a + 70a = 133a
  \]
  Simplifying the denominator:
  \[
  \frac{3}{4}a + a = \frac{3}{4}a + \frac{4}{4}a = \frac{7}{4}a
  \]
  Thus, the mean is:
  \[
  \text{mean} = \frac{133a}{\frac{7}{4}a} = \frac{133a \cdot 4}{7a} = \frac{532a}{7a} = \frac{532}{7} = 76
  \]
  Therefore, the mean score of all students is 76.
