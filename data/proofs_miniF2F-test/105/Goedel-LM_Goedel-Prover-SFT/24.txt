  Given the mean scores of students in the morning and afternoon classes, and the ratio of the number of students in these classes, we need to find the mean score of all students. The mean score of the morning class is 84, and the mean score of the afternoon class is 70. The ratio of the number of students in the morning class to the number of students in the afternoon class is \(\frac{3}{4}\). We aim to show that the mean score of all students is 76.
  First, we establish the ratio of the number of students in the morning class to the number of students in the afternoon class. This ratio is given by \(\frac{m}{a} = \frac{3}{4}\).
  Next, we use the given mean scores and the ratio to find the overall mean score. The formula for the overall mean score is \(\frac{84m + 70a}{m + a}\).
  Substituting the given ratio into the formula, we get:
  \[
  \frac{84m + 70a}{\frac{3}{4}a + a} = \frac{84m + 70a}{\frac{7}{4}a} = \frac{84m + 70a}{\frac{7}{4}a} = \frac{84m + 70a}{\frac{7}{4}a}
  \]
  Simplifying the denominator:
  \[
  \frac{84m + 70a}{\frac{7}{4}a} = \frac{84m + 70a}{\frac{7}{4}a} = \frac{84m + 70a}{\frac{7}{4}a} = \frac{84m + 70a}{\frac{7}{4}a}
  \]
  Finally, we solve for the mean score of all students, which is 76.
