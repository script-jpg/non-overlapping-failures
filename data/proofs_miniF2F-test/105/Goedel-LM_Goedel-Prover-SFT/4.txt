  Given the mean scores of students in two classes and the ratio of the number of students in each class, we need to find the overall mean score. The mean score of the morning class is 84, and the mean score of the afternoon class is 70. The ratio of the number of students in the morning class to the number of students in the afternoon class is \(\frac{3}{4}\). We are to show that the overall mean score is 76.
  First, we express the ratio of the number of students in the morning class to the number of students in the afternoon class using the given ratio:
  \[
  \frac{m}{a} = \frac{3}{4}
  \]
  This implies:
  \[
  4m = 3a
  \]
  Next, we substitute this equation into the formula for the overall mean score:
  \[
  \frac{84m + 70a}{m + a}
  \]
  We need to show that this expression equals 76. To do this, we simplify the equation:
  \[
  84m + 70a = 76(m + a)
  \]
  Expanding the right-hand side:
  \[
  84m + 70a = 76m + 76a
  \]
  Rearranging terms to isolate \(m\) and \(a\) on one side:
  \[
  84m - 76m = 76a - 70a
  \]
  Simplifying further:
  \[
  8m = 6a
  \]
  From the ratio \(4m = 3a\), we can substitute \(m = \frac{3}{4}a\) into the equation \(8m = 6a\):
  \[
  8 \left(\frac{3}{4}a\right) = 6a
  \]
  \[
  6a = 6a
  \]
  This confirms that the equation holds true, and thus the overall mean score is indeed 76.
