  Given the means of scores for two classes, we need to find the mean of scores for all students. The mean of scores in the morning class is 84, and in the afternoon class, it is 70. The ratio of the number of students in the morning class to the number of students in the afternoon class is \(\frac{3}{4}\). We need to show that the mean of scores for all students is 76.
  1. Start by expressing the ratio of the number of students in the morning class to the number of students in the afternoon class as \(\frac{m}{a} = \frac{3}{4}\).
  2. Use the given ratio to set up the equation \(m = \frac{3}{4}a\).
  3. Substitute \(m = \frac{3}{4}a\) into the expression for the mean of scores for all students.
  4. Simplify the expression using algebraic manipulations and properties of real numbers.
  5. Verify that the simplified expression equals 76.
