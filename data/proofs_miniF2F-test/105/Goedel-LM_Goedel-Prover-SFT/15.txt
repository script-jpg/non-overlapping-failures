  Given the mean scores of students in the morning and afternoon classes are 84 and 70 respectively, and the ratio of the number of students in the morning class to the number of students in the afternoon class is 3/4, we need to find the mean score of all students.
  Let \( m \) be the number of students in the morning class and \( a \) be the number of students in the afternoon class. We are given:
  \[ \frac{m}{a} = \frac{3}{4} \]
  This implies:
  \[ 4m = 3a \]
  The total score of the morning class is \( 84m \) and the total score of the afternoon class is \( 70a \). The combined total score is:
  \[ 84m + 70a \]
  The total number of students is:
  \[ m + a \]
  To find the mean score of all students, we divide the combined total score by the total number of students:
  \[ \frac{84m + 70a}{m + a} \]
  Using the relationship \( 4m = 3a \), we substitute \( m \) in terms of \( a \):
  \[ m = \frac{3a}{4} \]
  Substituting \( m \) into the mean score formula:
  \[ \frac{84 \left( \frac{3a}{4} \right) + 70a}{\frac{3a}{4} + a} \]
  Simplifying the numerator:
  \[ 84 \left( \frac{3a}{4} \right) + 70a = 63a + 70a = 133a \]
  Simplifying the denominator:
  \[ \frac{3a}{4} + a = \frac{3a + 4a}{4} = \frac{7a}{4} \]
  Thus, the mean score is:
  \[ \frac{133a}{\frac{7a}{4}} = \frac{133a \cdot 4}{7a} = \frac{532a}{7a} = \frac{532}{7} \approx 76 \]
