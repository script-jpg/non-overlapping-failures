  Given the mean scores of students in the morning and afternoon classes, and the ratio of the number of students in these classes, we need to find the mean score of all students. The mean score of the morning class is 84, and the mean score of the afternoon class is 70. The ratio of the number of students in the morning class to the afternoon class is 3/4. We need to show that the mean score of all students is 76.
  First, we establish that the number of students in the morning class \( m \) and the number of students in the afternoon class \( a \) are non-zero. Then, we use the given ratio to find the relationship between \( m \) and \( a \). Finally, we compute the mean score of all students by taking the weighted average of the mean scores of the morning and afternoon classes.
