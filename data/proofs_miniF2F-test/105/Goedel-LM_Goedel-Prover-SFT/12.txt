  Given the mean scores of students in the morning and afternoon classes, and the ratio of the number of students in these classes, we need to find the mean score of all students. The mean score of the morning class is 84, and the mean score of the afternoon class is 70. The ratio of the number of students in the morning class to the number of students in the afternoon class is 3/4. We need to show that the mean score of all students is 76.
  First, we establish that the number of students in the morning class is \( m \) and in the afternoon class is \( a \). Using the given ratio, we have:
  \[ \frac{m}{a} = \frac{3}{4} \]
  This implies:
  \[ 4m = 3a \]
  Next, we use the mean scores to find the overall mean score. The total score of the morning class is \( 84m \) and the total score of the afternoon class is \( 70a \). The overall mean score is given by:
  \[ \frac{84m + 70a}{m + a} \]
  We need to show that this equals 76. Substituting \( m = \frac{3}{4}a \) into the equation, we get:
  \[ \frac{84 \left( \frac{3}{4}a \right) + 70a}{\frac{3}{4}a + a} = \frac{76a}{\frac{7}{4}a} = \frac{76}{7} = 10.857 \]
  However, this does not match the expected mean score of 76. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the problem setup and calculations.
