  Given that the mean score of the morning class students is 84 and the mean score of the afternoon class students is 70, and the ratio of the number of students in the morning class to the number of students in the afternoon class is \(\frac{3}{4}\), we need to find the mean score of all the students.
  Let \(m\) be the number of students in the morning class and \(a\) be the number of students in the afternoon class. According to the problem, we have:
  \[
  \frac{m}{a} = \frac{3}{4}
  \]
  This implies:
  \[
  m = \frac{3}{4} a
  \]
  The total mean score of all the students is given by:
  \[
  \text{Mean} = \frac{84m + 70a}{m + a}
  \]
  Substituting \(m = \frac{3}{4} a\) into the equation, we get:
  \[
  \text{Mean} = \frac{84 \left(\frac{3}{4} a\right) + 70a}{\frac{3}{4} a + a} = \frac{84 \cdot \frac{3}{4} a + 70a}{\frac{3}{4} a + a} = \frac{63a + 70a}{\frac{3}{4} a + a} = \frac{133a}{\frac{7}{4} a} = \frac{133a \cdot 4}{7a} = \frac{532}{7} \approx 76
  \]
  Thus, the mean score of all the students is \(\boxed{76}\).
