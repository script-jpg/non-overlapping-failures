  Given that the mean of the scores of the students in the morning class is 84 and the mean score of the afternoon class is 70, and the ratio of the number of students in the morning class to the number of students in the afternoon class is \(\frac{3}{4}\), we need to find the mean of the scores of all the students.
  Let \(m\) be the number of students in the morning class and \(a\) be the number of students in the afternoon class. According to the given ratio, we have:
  \[
  \frac{m}{a} = \frac{3}{4}
  \]
  This implies:
  \[
  4m = 3a
  \]
  To find the mean of the scores of all the students, we calculate the total mean score as:
  \[
  \frac{84m + 70a}{m + a}
  \]
  Substituting \(m = \frac{3a}{4}\) into the expression, we get:
  \[
  \frac{84 \left(\frac{3a}{4}\right) + 70a}{\frac{3a}{4} + a}
  \]
  Simplifying the numerator:
  \[
  84 \left(\frac{3a}{4}\right) + 70a = 84 \cdot \frac{3a}{4} + 70a = 63a + 70a = 133a
  \]
  Simplifying the denominator:
  \[
  \frac{3a}{4} + a = \frac{3a}{4} + \frac{4a}{4} = \frac{7a}{4}
  \]
  Thus, the mean score is:
  \[
  \frac{133a}{\frac{7a}{4}} = \frac{133a \cdot 4}{7a} = \frac{532a}{7a} = \frac{532}{7} \approx 76
  \]
  Therefore, the mean of the scores of all the students is 76.
