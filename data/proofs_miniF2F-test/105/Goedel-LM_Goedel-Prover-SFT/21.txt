  Given that the mean score of the students in the morning class is 84, and the mean score of the students in the afternoon class is 70, we need to find the mean score of all students. The ratio of the number of students in the morning class to the number of students in the afternoon class is given as \( \frac{3}{4} \).
  Let \( m \) be the number of students in the morning class and \( a \) be the number of students in the afternoon class. We are provided with the following conditions:
  1. \( 0 < m \) and \( 0 < a \)
  2. \( \frac{m}{a} = \frac{3}{4} \)
  From the ratio condition, we can express \( m \) in terms of \( a \):
  \[ m = \frac{3}{4} a \]
  The total mean score of all students is given by:
  \[ \frac{84m + 70a}{m + a} \]
  Substituting \( m = \frac{3}{4} a \) into the formula, we get:
  \[ \frac{84 \left( \frac{3}{4} a \right) + 70a}{\frac{3}{4} a + a} \]
  Simplifying the numerator:
  \[ 84 \left( \frac{3}{4} a \right) + 70a = 63a + 70a = 133a \]
  Simplifying the denominator:
  \[ \frac{3}{4} a + a = \frac{3}{4} a + \frac{4}{4} a = \frac{7}{4} a \]
  Thus, the mean score becomes:
  \[ \frac{133a}{\frac{7}{4} a} = \frac{133a \cdot 4}{7a} = \frac{532a}{7a} = \frac{532}{7} = 76 \]
  Therefore, the mean score of all students is 76.
