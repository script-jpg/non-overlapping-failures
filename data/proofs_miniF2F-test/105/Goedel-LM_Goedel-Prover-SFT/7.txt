  To solve the problem, we start by using the given ratio of the number of students in the morning class to the number of students in the afternoon class, which is \(\frac{3}{4}\). We then express the total number of students in terms of the number of students in the afternoon class. Using the given means of the scores, we set up the equation for the total mean score and solve for the unknown number of students in the afternoon class. Finally, we verify that the total mean score is indeed 76.
