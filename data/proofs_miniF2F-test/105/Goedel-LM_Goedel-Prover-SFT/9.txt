  Given the mean scores of two classes, the ratio of the number of students in each class, and the total number of students, we need to find the mean score of all students. We are provided with the following information:
  - The mean score of the morning class is 84.
  - The mean score of the afternoon class is 70.
  - The ratio of the number of students in the morning class to the number of students in the afternoon class is \(\frac{3}{4}\).
  - The total number of students is the sum of the number of students in both classes.
  To find the mean score of all students, we use the formula for the weighted average:
  \[
  \text{Mean score of all students} = \frac{\text{Total score of morning students} + \text{Total score of afternoon students}}{\text{Total number of students}}
  \]
  Given the mean scores and the ratio of the number of students, we can calculate the total score for each class and then find the overall mean score.
