  To solve the problem, we start by using the given ratio of the number of students in the morning class to the number of students in the afternoon class, which is \(\frac{3}{4}\). We then express the total number of students as the sum of the number of students in both classes. Using the mean scores, we can set up an equation for the overall mean score. By simplifying this equation and solving for the total mean score, we find that the overall mean score is indeed 76.
