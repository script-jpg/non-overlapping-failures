The key insight in this problem is that we need to find the weighted mean of the scores based on the number of students in each class. 

Given that the ratio of students in the morning class to the afternoon class is $\frac{3}{4}$, let's denote the number of students in the morning as $3k$ and in the afternoon as $4k$ for some positive integer $k$. 

The total score for the morning class is $84 \cdot 3k = 252k$, and for the afternoon class, it's $70 \cdot 4k = 280k$. 

The combined total score is $252k + 280k = 532k$, and the total number of students is $3k + 4k = 7k$. 

Thus, the mean score for all students is $\frac{532k}{7k} = \frac{532}{7} = 76$.

The Lean proof captures this reasoning by:
1. Converting the natural numbers m and a to reals and establishing they are positive
2. Using field_simp to manipulate the equation involving the ratio
3. Using ring_nf to normalize the arithmetic expressions
4. Using linarith to solve the resulting linear arithmetic goal

The Lean proof is elegant in how it directly manipulates the equations without needing to introduce additional variables like $k$. It demonstrates that given the constraints, the mean must be 76, confirming the answer is $\boxed{76}$.
