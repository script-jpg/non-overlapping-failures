The final answer is $ \boxed{76} $

This is a weighted mean problem.  The mean of the combined class is
\[\frac{84\cdot 3a+70\cdot 4a}{3a+4a}=\frac{452a}{7a}=\boxed{\textbf{(C)} ~76}.\]

Let the ratio of students in the morning to those in the afternoon be $3:4$, so there are $3a$ students in the morning and $4a$ students in the afternoon.  Then the overall mean is $\frac{84\cdot 3a+70\cdot 4a}{3a+4a}=\frac{452a}{7a}=\boxed{\textbf{(C)} ~76}$.

The mean of the combined class is $\frac{84\cdot 3a+70\cdot 4a}{3a+4a}=\frac{452a}{7a}=\boxed{\textbf{(C)} ~76}$, where $a$ is the number of students in the afternoon class.

Let the number of students in the morning class be $m$ and the number of students in the afternoon class be $a$.  We know that $\frac{m}{a}=\frac{3}{4}$.  The sum of the students' scores is $84m+70a$.  The mean of the combined class is $\frac{84m+70a}{m+a}$.  Let's manipulate this expression algebraically:

\begin{align*}
\frac{84m+70a}{m+a}&=\frac{84\left(\frac{3}{4}a\right)+70a}{\frac{3}{4}a+a}&&\text{substituting }m=\frac{3}{4}a\text{ from }m:a=3:4\\
&=\frac{63a+70a}{\frac{7}{4}a}&&\text{distributing and arithmetic}\\
&=\frac{133a}{\frac{7}{4}a}&&\text{arithmetic}\\
&=\frac{133\cdot\frac{4}{7}}{a}\cdot a&&\text{multiplying by reciprocal}\\
&=\frac{133\cdot\frac{4}{7}}{\cancel{a}}\cdot\cancel{a}&&\text{a's cancel out}\\
&=76&&\text{evaluating}
\end{align*}

The mean of the combined class is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)} ~76}$.

The mean of the morning class is $84$ and the mean of the afternoon class is $70$.  The overall mean is closer to $84$ than $70$; the weighted mean is $84\cdot\frac{3}{7}+70\cdot\frac{4}{7}=\boxed{\textbf{(C)} ~76}$.

Let the number of students in the morning class be $m$ and the number of students in the afternoon class be $a$.  The sum of the students in the morning class is $84\cdot m$ and the sum of the students in the afternoon class is $70\cdot a$.  The combined sum is $84m+70a$.  Since $\frac{m}{a}=\frac{3}{4}$, $m=\frac{3}{4}a$.  Substituting for $m$, the combined sum is $84\cdot\frac{3}{4}a+70a=63a+70a=133a$.  The combined student population is $m+a=\frac{3}{4}a+a=\frac{7}{4}a$.  The overall mean is $\frac{133a}{\frac{7}{4}a}=\frac{133}{\frac{7}{4}}=133\cdot\frac{4}{7}=\boxed{\textbf{(C)} ~76}$.

/-- Ms. Blackwell gives an exam to two classes. The mean of the scores of the students in the morning class is $84$, and the afternoon class's mean score is $70$. The ratio of the number of students in the morning class to the number of students in the afternoon class is $\frac{3}{4}$. What is the mean of the scores of all the students?
