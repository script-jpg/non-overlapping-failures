  To solve the problem, we start by simplifying the expression inside the square root. We use the properties of logarithms to combine the terms inside the square root. Specifically, we use the property that \(\log_b a + \log_b c = \log_b (ac)\). Applying this property, we combine \(\log_2 6\) and \(\log_3 6\) into a single logarithm. We then simplify the resulting expression using algebraic manipulations and finally verify that the simplified expression matches the given form.
