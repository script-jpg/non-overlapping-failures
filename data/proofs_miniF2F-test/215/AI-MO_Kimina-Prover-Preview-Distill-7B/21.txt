In an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Let's denote the common difference as $d$.

- The first term is $y + 6$.
- The second term is $12$.
- The third term is $y$.

Since the difference between the first and second terms is $d = 12 - (y + 6) = 6 - y$, and the difference between the second and third terms is $d = y - 12$, we must have $6 - y = y - 12$.

This gives us the equation $6 - y = y - 12$, which simplifies to $6 + 12 = y + y$, or $y + 6 = 12$.

From $y + 6 = 12$, we can solve for $y$ to get $y = 12 - 6 = 6$. However, this contradicts the given answer of $9$.

Let's re-evaluate the problem. The three terms are $y + 6$, $12$, and $y$. For an arithmetic sequence, the middle term is the average of the other two terms. Therefore, $12 = \frac{(y + 6) + y}{2} = \frac{2y + 6}{2} = y + 3$.

From $12 = y + 3$, we get $y = 12 - 3 = 9$. This matches the boxed answer.

The Lean proof should reflect this reasoning:

Now we can import the necessary libraries and set up the theorem:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_359 (y : ℝ) (h₀ : y + 6 + y = 2 * 12) : y = 9 := by
```

The theorem states that if $y$ is a real number satisfying the equation $y + 6 + y = 2 \cdot 12$, then $y = 9$.

Let's solve the equation:
$y + 6 + y = 2 \cdot 12$
$2y + 6 = 24$
$2y = 18$
$y = 9$

This matches our arithmetic sequence property that the middle term is the average of the other two terms.

Now we complete the Lean proof:

```tactics
linarith
```

The `linarith` tactic is powerful enough to solve linear arithmetic goals. It will take the equation $y + 6 + y = 24$ and derive that $y = 9$ directly.

So the complete Lean proof is:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

theorem mathd_algebra_359 (y : ℝ) (h₀ : y + 6 + y = 2 * 12) : y = 9 := by
  linarith
```

The Lean proof is elegant in its simplicity. It directly translates the arithmetic sequence property into an algebraic equation and uses Lean's automation to solve the equation. The key insight is that in an arithmetic sequence, the middle term is the average of the other two terms, which gives us the equation $12 = \frac{(y + 6) + y}{2}$, or equivalently, $y + 6 + y = 2 \cdot 12$.
