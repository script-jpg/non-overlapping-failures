-- The arithmetic sequence has a common difference. Thus, $y + 6 + y = 12 + y + 6$.
  have : y + 6 + y = 12 + y + 6 := by linarith

  -- And, $12 + y + 6 = 18 + y$. Thus, $y + 6 + y = 18 + y$.
  have : 12 + y + 6 = 18 + y := by linarith

  -- Subtracting $y$ from both sides, get $y + 6 = 18$.
  have : y + 6 = 18 := by linarith

  -- Thus, $y = 12$.
