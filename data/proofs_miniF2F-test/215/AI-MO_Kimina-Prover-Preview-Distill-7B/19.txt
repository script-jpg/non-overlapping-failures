This completes our proof that $y = 9$ in the arithmetic sequence $y + 6$, $12$, $y$.

The key insight is that in an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Therefore, the difference between the first two terms $(12 - (y + 6))$ must equal the difference between the last two terms $(y - 12)$. This gives us the equation $12 - (y + 6) = y - 12$, which simplifies to $y = 9$.

The Lean proof demonstrates this algebraic manipulation formally. We start with the equation $y + 6 + y = 2 \cdot 12$, which comes from the fact that the average of the first two terms should equal the middle term in an arithmetic sequence. This is another valid approach, leading to the same result.

In summary, the value of $y$ is 9, which makes $y + 6$, $12$, $y$ an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of $3$.
