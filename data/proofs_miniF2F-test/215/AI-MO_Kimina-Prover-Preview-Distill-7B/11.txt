This completes the proof. The key insight is that in an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Thus, the difference between the first and second terms equals the difference between the second and third terms: $12 - (y + 6) = y - 12$. This equation simplifies to $y = 9$.

The Lean 4 solution formalizes this reasoning directly by:
1. Taking the given condition `h₀ : y + 6 + y = 2 * 12` which represents the equality of the sum of the first and third terms to twice the second term (a property of arithmetic sequences)
2. Using `linarith` to solve the resulting linear arithmetic goal

The Lean proof is remarkably concise because the `linarith` tactic is powerful enough to solve linear arithmetic problems automatically. It essentially performs the algebraic manipulation we would do by hand: 
- Starting from $y + 6 + y = 24$ (since $2 \cdot 12 = 24$)
- Simplifying to $2y + 6 = 24$
- Subtracting 6 from both sides to get $2y = 18$
- Dividing by 2 to conclude $y = 9$

Therefore, the value of $y$ in the arithmetic sequence is indeed 9.
