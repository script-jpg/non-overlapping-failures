Let's analyze this step by step.

We have an arithmetic sequence with terms $y + 6$, $12$, and $y$. In an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Let's denote this common difference as $d$.

1. The difference between the first and second terms is $12 - (y + 6) = 6 - y$.
2. The difference between the second and third terms is $y - 12$.

Since it's an arithmetic sequence, these differences must be equal:
$6 - y = y - 12$

Let's solve this equation algebraically:
$6 - y = y - 12$
$6 + 12 = y + y$
$18 = 2y$
$y = 9$

So we expect $y = 9$.

Now, let's look at the formal Lean 4 solution:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

```

We start by importing the necessary libraries and setting up the environment. The `maxHeartbeats 0` option allows Lean to use as many computational steps as needed.

Next, we define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_359 (y : ℝ) (h₀ : y + 6 + y = 2 * 12) : y = 9 := by
```

The theorem states that for a real number $y$ satisfying the equation $y + 6 + y = 2 \cdot 12$, we have $y = 9$. This equation comes from the property of arithmetic sequences: the sum of the first and third terms equals twice the second term.

Now, let's solve the equation using Lean:

```tactics
linarith
```

The `linarith` tactic is powerful for solving linear arithmetic problems. It automatically handles the equation $y + 6 + y = 24$ (since $2 \cdot 12 = 24$) and solves for $y$:
$2y + 6 = 24$
$2y = 18$
$y = 9$

So the complete proof is simply:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat

theorem mathd_algebra_359 (y : ℝ) (h₀ : y + 6 + y = 2 * 12) : y = 9 := by
  linarith
```

This elegant proof demonstrates how Lean's automation can handle simple algebraic manipulations efficiently. The key insight is that in an arithmetic sequence, the middle term is the average of the first and third terms, which gives us the equation $y + 6 + y = 2 \cdot 12$.
