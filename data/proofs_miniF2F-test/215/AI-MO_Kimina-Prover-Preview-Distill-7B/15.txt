The proof is correct. In an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Given the sequence $y + 6$, $12$, $y$, we have:

- The difference between the first and second terms: $12 - (y + 6) = 6 - y$
- The difference between the second and third terms: $y - 12$

For it to be an arithmetic sequence, these differences must be equal:
$6 - y = y - 12$

Solving this equation:
$6 - y = y - 12$
$6 + 12 = y + y$
$18 = 2y$
$y = 9$

The formal proof uses `linarith` to solve the equation $y + 6 + y = 2 \cdot 12$, which is equivalent to $2y + 6 = 24$ or $2y = 18$ or $y = 9$. This directly solves for $y$ by manipulating the equation algebraically. The Lean 4 proof is remarkably concise because Lean's automation is powerful enough to solve simple arithmetic goals like this one. The tactic `linarith` is particularly powerful for solving goals involving linear arithmetic over real numbers (or integers or natural numbers).

Therefore, the value of $y$ is indeed 9, confirming the boxed answer.
