In an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Given the sequence $y + 6$, $12$, $y$, we can determine the value of $y$ by recognizing that the difference between the first two terms should equal the difference between the last two terms.

The difference between the first two terms is $12 - (y + 6) = 12 - y - 6 = 6 - y$.

The difference between the last two terms is $y - 12$.

For the sequence to be arithmetic, these differences must be equal:
$6 - y = y - 12$

Solving this equation:
$6 - y = y - 12$
$6 + 12 = y + y$
$18 = 2y$
$y = 9$

So the value of $y$ is 9.

In Lean 4, we can formalize this as:

Now, let's define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_359 (y : ℝ) (h₀ : y + 6 + y = 2 * 12) : y = 9 := by
```

The theorem states that if $y$ is a real number satisfying the equation $y + 6 + y = 2 \cdot 12$, then $y = 9$.

Let's analyze where this equation comes from. In an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. So for the sequence $y + 6$, $12$, $y$, we have:
$12 - (y + 6) = y - 12$
$12 - y - 6 = y - 12$
$6 - y = y - 12$
$6 + 12 = y + y$
$18 = 2y$
$y = 9$

The equation $y + 6 + y = 2 \cdot 12$ is another way to express this relationship. It comes from the fact that $12$ is the average of $y + 6$ and $y$ in an arithmetic sequence. So the sum of the three terms is $3 \cdot 12 = 36$:
$y + 6 + y + 12 + y = 36$
$3y + 18 = 36$
$3y = 18$
$y = 6$

Wait, let me recalculate that correctly. The sum of the three terms should be $2 \cdot 12 + (y + 6) = 36$:
$12 + (y + 6) = 36$
$y + 18 = 36$
$y = 18$

No, that's still not right. Let me think again. The sum of an arithmetic sequence is not simply the sum of the first and last terms. For three terms in an arithmetic sequence, the sum is indeed $3$ times the middle term:
$y + 6 + y = 2y + 6 = 2 \cdot 12 = 24$
$2y = 18$
$y = 9$

So the equation $y + 6 + y = 2 \cdot 12$ is indeed correct. Now let's complete the proof:

```tactics
linarith
```

The `linarith` tactic is powerful enough to solve linear arithmetic goals directly. It will take the equation $y + 6 + y = 2 \cdot 12$, which is $2y + 6 = 24$, and derive that $y = 9$.

So our complete formal proof is:
1. We're given that $y + 6 + y = 2 \cdot 12$
2. This simplifies to $2y + 6 = 24$
3. Subtracting 6 from both sides: $2y = 18$
4. Dividing by 2: $y = 9$
5. The `linarith` tactic can solve this directly

Therefore, the value of $y$ in the arithmetic sequence is 9.
