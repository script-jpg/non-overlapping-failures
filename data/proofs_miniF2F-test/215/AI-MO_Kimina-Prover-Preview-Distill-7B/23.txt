-- The given equation is based on the property of an arithmetic sequence,
  -- where the middle term is the average of the terms on either side.
  -- Thus, $12 = \frac{y + 6 + y}{2}$.

  -- Alternatively, we can derive the same result using the standard formula
  -- for the $n$-th term of an arithmetic sequence: $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$,
  -- where $a_1$ is the first term and $d$ is the common difference.
  -- For the second term, we have: $12 = y + 6 + (2-1)d = y + 6 + d$,
  -- where $d = (12 - (y + 6)) = (y - 12)$.
  -- Thus, $12 = y + 6 + (12 - (y + 6)) = y + 6 + 12 - y - 6 = 12$.
  have h₂ : y = 9 := by
    linarith

  -- The `linarith` tactic is powerful enough to solve linear arithmetic goals.
  -- It automatically handles the algebraic manipulations required to derive
  -- the value of $y$ from the given equations.
