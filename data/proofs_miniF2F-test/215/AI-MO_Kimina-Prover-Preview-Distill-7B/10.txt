-- The given arithmetic sequence has three terms: $y + 6$, $12$, and $y$.
  -- In an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant.
  -- Thus, $12 - (y + 6) = y - 12$.
  -- This simplifies to $12 - y - 6 = y - 12$, or $6 - y = y - 12$.
  -- Rearranging, we get $6 + 12 = y + y$, or $18 = 2y$, so $y = 9$.
