-- The arithmetic sequence $y + 6$, $12$, $y$ forces $y$ to be 9.

The theorem states that if $y + 6 + y = 2 \cdot 12$, then $y = 9$. This is exactly the condition for $y$ to be the middle term of the arithmetic sequence. The proof follows directly from the properties of arithmetic sequences: the middle term is the average of the surrounding terms. Thus, $y = \frac{(y + 6) + y}{2} = \frac{2y + 6}{2} = y + 3$. Solving $y + 3 = 12$ gives $y = 9$.

The Lean proof is remarkably concise because the arithmetic sequence condition directly translates to the equation $y + 6 + y = 2 \cdot 12$, which is precisely what we have as hypothesis `h₀`. The `linarith` tactic is powerful enough to solve linear arithmetic goals and is able to deduce that the only value of $y$ satisfying this equation is $y = 9$.

To elaborate on why $y + 6 + y = 2 \cdot 12$ is the correct equation: In an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Thus, $12 - (y + 6) = y - 12$. Simplifying the left side: $12 - y - 6 = 6 - y$. Simplifying the right side: $y - 12$. Setting them equal: $6 - y = y - 12$. Solving for $y$: $6 + 12 = y + y$ which is $18 = 2y$ so $y = 9$.

The Lean proof is elegant because it directly works with the equation derived from the arithmetic sequence property, showing that $y = 9$ is the only solution.
