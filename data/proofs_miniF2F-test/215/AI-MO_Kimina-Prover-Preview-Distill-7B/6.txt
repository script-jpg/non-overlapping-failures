-- The arithmetic sequence has a common difference, so $12 - (y + 6) = y - 12$, which simplifies to $y = 9$.

The standard approach to solving this problem is to recognize that in an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Given the sequence $y + 6$, $12$, $y$, we have:

- The difference between the first two terms is $12 - (y + 6) = 12 - y - 6 = 6 - y$.
- The difference between the last two terms is $y - 12$.

For the sequence to be arithmetic, these differences must be equal:
$6 - y = y - 12$

Solving for $y$:
$6 - y = y - 12$
$6 + 12 = y + y$
$18 = 2y$
$y = 9$

Let's translate this into Lean 4:

We begin by importing the necessary libraries and setting up the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_359 (y : ℝ) (h₀ : y + 6 + y = 2 * 12) : y = 9 := by
```

Our theorem states that if $y$ is a real number satisfying the equation $y + 6 + y = 2 \cdot 12$, then $y = 9$. This equation comes from the property of arithmetic sequences where the sum of the first and last terms equals twice the middle term.

Now, let's solve the equation algebraically:
$y + 6 + y = 24$ (since $2 \cdot 12 = 24$)
$2y + 6 = 24$
$2y = 18$
$y = 9$

In Lean, we can use the `linarith` tactic to solve linear arithmetic goals:

```tactics
linarith
```

The `linarith` tactic is powerful for solving goals involving linear arithmetic. It automatically handles the algebraic manipulations we did manually: simplifying the equation $y + 6 + y = 24$ to $2y = 18$, and then to $y = 9$. It proves that $y = 9$ is the only solution to the equation.

Therefore, the value of $y$ in the arithmetic sequence is 9, which is our final answer.
