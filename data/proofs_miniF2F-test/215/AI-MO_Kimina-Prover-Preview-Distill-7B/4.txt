linarith

The formal solution is remarkably concise because the `linarith` tactic is powerful enough to solve systems of linear arithmetic goals. In this case, it's given the equation `y + 6 + y = 2 * 12` which comes from the property of an arithmetic sequence where the middle term is the average of the terms on either side.

So we have: $12 = \frac{y + 6 + y}{2}$

Multiplying both sides by 2: $24 = y + 6 + y$

Simplifying: $24 = 2y + 6$

Subtracting 6 from both sides: $18 = 2y$

Dividing by 2: $y = 9$

The `linarith` tactic is able to solve this equation directly from the hypothesis `h₀: y + 6 + y = 2 * 12` and prove that `y = 9`.

This demonstrates how a simple algebraic problem can be formalized in Lean, and how Lean's automation can handle straightforward arithmetic calculations that would typically be done by hand in a traditional proof.
