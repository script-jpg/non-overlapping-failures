-- The problem states that $y + 6$, $12$, $y$ forms an arithmetic sequence. In an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Let's denote this common difference as $d$.

  -- The difference between the second term and the first term is $12 - (y + 6) = 6 - y$.
  -- The difference between the third term and the second term is $y - 12$.

  -- Since it's an arithmetic sequence, these differences must be equal:
  -- $6 - y = y - 12$

  -- Solving for $y$:
  -- $6 - y = y - 12$
  -- $6 + 12 = y + y$
  -- $18 = 2y$
  -- $y = 9$

  -- The above reasoning is encoded in the Lean proof as follows:
