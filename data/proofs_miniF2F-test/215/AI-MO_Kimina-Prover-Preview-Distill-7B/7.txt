-- the common difference of an arithmetic sequence is the same between any two terms
  -- the difference between the second term $12$ and the first term $y + 6$ is $12 - (y + 6) = 6 - y$,
  -- and the difference between the third term $y$ and the second term $12$ is $y - 12$.
  -- Therefore, $6 - y = y - 12$, which implies $y = 9$.
