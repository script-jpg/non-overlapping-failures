This completes our proof that $y = 9$ in the arithmetic sequence $y + 6$, $12$, $y$.

In an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Let's verify this property for our solution:

- The first term is $y + 6$
- The second term is $12$
- The third term is $y$

The difference between the second and first term is $12 - (y + 6) = 12 - y - 6 = 6 - y$.
The difference between the third and second term is $y - 12$.

For the sequence to be arithmetic, these differences must be equal:
$6 - y = y - 12$

Solving this equation:
$6 - y = y - 12$
$6 + 12 = y + y$
$18 = 2y$
$y = 9$

This confirms our solution. The value of $y$ is indeed 9, making the arithmetic sequence $15$, $12$, $9$ with a common difference of $-3$.
