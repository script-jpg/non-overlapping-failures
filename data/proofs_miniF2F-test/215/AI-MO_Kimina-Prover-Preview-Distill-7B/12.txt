-- The problem states that $y + 6$, $12$, $y$ form an arithmetic sequence.
  -- This means the difference between consecutive terms is constant.
  -- So we have $12 - (y + 6) = y - 12$.
  -- Simplifying either equation gives $y = 9$.

In this Lean proof, we're given that $y + 6$, $12$, $y$ form an arithmetic sequence. This means the difference between consecutive terms is the same. So we have:
- $12 - (y + 6) = y - 12$
- Simplifying: $12 - y - 6 = y - 12$
- Further simplifying: $6 - y = y - 12$
- Adding $y$ to both sides: $6 = 2y - 12$
- Adding $12$ to both sides: $18 = 2y$
- Dividing by $2$: $y = 9$

The Lean proof uses `linarith` to solve this equation directly from the hypothesis `h₀ : y + 6 + y = 2 * 12`. Let's verify this:
- $y + 6 + y = 2 \cdot 12$
- $2y + 6 = 24$
- $2y = 18$
- $y = 9$

So indeed, the value of $y$ is 9, which is $\boxed{9}$ in the boxed answer.
