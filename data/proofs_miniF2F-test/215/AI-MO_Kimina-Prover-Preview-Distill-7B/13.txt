This completes the proof that $y = 9$.

The key insight is that in an arithmetic sequence, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Here, the difference between the first and second terms is $12 - (y + 6) = 6 - y$, and the difference between the second and third terms is $y - 12$. For the sequence to be arithmetic, these differences must be equal:

$6 - y = y - 12$

Solving this equation gives:

$6 - y = y - 12$

$6 + 12 = y + y$

$18 = 2y$

$y = 9$

Therefore, the value of $y$ is 9, making the arithmetic sequence 15, 12, 9 with a common difference of -3.
