-- the sequence is $y+6$, $12$, $y$; so the middle term is the average of its neighbors, so $2\cdot 12 = (y+6) + y$.

The theorem states that given $y + 6 + y = 2 \cdot 12$, we need to prove $y = 9$. This equation comes from the property of an arithmetic sequence, where the middle term is the average of the terms on either side. Here, $12$ is the average of $y+6$ and $y$, so $2 \cdot 12 = (y+6) + y$.

Let's solve this algebraically:
- $y + 6 + y = 2 \cdot 12$
- $2y + 6 = 24$
- $2y = 18$
- $y = 9$

The Lean proof uses the `linarith` tactic, which is powerful enough to solve linear arithmetic goals. It will:
1. Take the hypothesis `h₀ : y + 6 + y = 2 * 12`
2. Simplify it to `y + 6 + y = 24`
3. Rearrange to `2 * y + 6 = 24`
4. Subtract 6 from both sides to get `2 * y = 18`
5. Divide by 2 to get `y = 9`
6. Conclude that `y = 9` matches our goal

Therefore, the complete Lean 4 proof is:

This proof is elegant in its simplicity, using Lean's powerful automation to solve the linear equation that represents the arithmetic sequence property. The theorem statement precisely captures the mathematical problem, and the proof follows directly from the algebraic manipulation of the equation.
