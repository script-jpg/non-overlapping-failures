  Given the arithmetic sequence \( y + 6 \), \( 12 \), \( y \), we need to find the value of \( y \). The mean of the sequence is given by \( 12 \). By setting up the equation for the mean, we have:
  \[
  \frac{y + 6 + y}{2} = 12
  \]
  Simplifying this equation:
  \[
  \frac{2y + 6}{2} = 12
  \]
  \[
  2y + 6 = 24
  \]
  Solving for \( y \):
  \[
  2y = 24 - 6
  \]
  \[
  2y = 18
  \]
  \[
  y = 9
  \]
  Thus, the value of \( y \) is \( 9 \).

  -- We know from the given hypothesis that the mean of the sequence is 12.
  have h₁ : y = 9 := by
    -- We use the given equation to solve for y.
    have h₁ : y + 6 + y = 2 * 12 := by linarith
    -- Simplify the equation to isolate y.
    have h₂ : 2 * y + 6 = 24 := by linarith
    -- Solve for y by isolating it on one side of the equation.
    have h₃ : 2 * y = 18 := by linarith
    -- Divide by 2 to find the value of y.
    have h₄ : y = 9 := by linarith
    -- We have found that y equals 9.
    exact h₄
  -- The final result is that y equals 9.
  exact h₁
