  To solve for \( y \) in the arithmetic sequence \( y + 6 \), \( 12 \), \( y \), we start with the given equation \( y + 6 + y = 2 \times 12 \). Simplifying this equation, we get \( 2y + 6 = 24 \). Subtracting 6 from both sides, we obtain \( 2y = 18 \). Dividing both sides by 2, we find \( y = 9 \).

  have h₁ : 2 * y + 6 = 24 := by
    linarith
  -- Solve for y by isolating it on one side of the equation
  have h₂ : 2 * y = 18 := by
    linarith
  -- Divide both sides by 2 to find the value of y
  have h₃ : y = 9 := by
