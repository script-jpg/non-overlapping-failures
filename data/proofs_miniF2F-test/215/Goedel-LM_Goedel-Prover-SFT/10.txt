  To solve the problem of finding the value of \( y \) in the arithmetic sequence \( y + 6 \), \( 12 \), \( y \), we need to ensure that the sequence is arithmetic. This implies that the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
  \[ y + 6 + y = 2 \times 12 \]
  Simplifying this equation, we get:
  \[ 2y + 6 = 24 \]
  Subtracting 6 from both sides, we obtain:
  \[ 2y = 18 \]
  Dividing both sides by 2, we find:
  \[ y = 9 \]

  -- We start by simplifying the given equation y + 6 + y = 2 * 12
  have h₁ : y = 9 := by
    -- Simplify the equation to 2y + 6 = 24
    have h₂ : 2 * y + 6 = 24 := by linarith
    -- Subtract 6 from both sides to get 2y = 18
    have h₃ : 2 * y = 18 := by linarith
    -- Divide both sides by 2 to solve for y
    have h₄ : y = 9 := by linarith
    -- We have found that y = 9
    exact h₄
  -- The final result is y = 9
  exact h₁
