  To solve for \( y \) in the arithmetic sequence \( y + 6, 12, y \), we start by setting up the equation derived from the properties of arithmetic sequences. The equation is \( y + 6 + y = 2 \cdot 12 \). Simplifying this equation, we combine like terms to get \( 2y + 6 = 24 \). Subtracting 6 from both sides, we obtain \( 2y = 18 \). Dividing both sides by 2, we find \( y = 9 \).

  -- Simplify the given equation by combining like terms: y + 6 + y = 2 * 12
  have h₁ : y + 6 + y = 2 * 12 := by linarith
  -- Combine the y terms: 2y + 6 = 24
  have h₂ : 2 * y + 6 = 24 := by linarith
  -- Subtract 6 from both sides to isolate the term with y: 2y = 18
  have h₃ : 2 * y = 18 := by linarith
  -- Divide both sides by 2 to solve for y: y = 9
  have h₄ : y = 9 := by linarith
  -- The final result is y = 9
