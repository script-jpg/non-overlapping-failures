  Given the arithmetic sequence \( y + 6 \), \( 12 \), and \( y \) in sequence, we need to determine the value of \( y \). The sum of the first and third terms is equal to twice the second term. This can be expressed as:
  \[ y + 6 + y = 2 \times 12 \]
  Simplifying this equation:
  \[ 2y + 6 = 24 \]
  Subtracting 6 from both sides:
  \[ 2y = 18 \]
  Dividing both sides by 2:
  \[ y = 9 \]
  Thus, the value of \( y \) is \( 9 \).

  -- We start by simplifying the given equation y + 6 + y = 2 * 12
  have h₁ : y = 9 := by
    -- Simplify the equation to 2y + 6 = 24
    have h₁ : 2 * y + 6 = 24 := by
      linarith
    -- Solve for y by isolating it on one side of the equation
    have h₂ : 2 * y = 18 := by
      linarith
    -- Divide both sides by 2 to get y = 9
    linarith
  -- The final result is y = 9
