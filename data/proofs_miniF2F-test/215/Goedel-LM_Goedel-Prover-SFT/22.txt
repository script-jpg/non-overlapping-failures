  Given the arithmetic sequence \( y + 6, 12, y \), we need to determine the value of \( y \). The sequence is an arithmetic progression, meaning the difference between consecutive terms is constant. We can set up the equation:
  \[ y + 6 + y = 2 \cdot 12 \]
  Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:
  \[ 2y + 6 = 24 \]
  Subtracting 6 from both sides, we obtain:
  \[ 2y = 18 \]
  Dividing both sides by 2, we find:
  \[ y = 9 \]

  -- We start by simplifying the given equation y + 6 + y = 2 * 12
  have h₁ : y = 9 := by
    -- Simplify the equation to 2y + 6 = 24

  -- Substitute y = 9 into the original equation to verify
  rw [h₁] at h₀
  -- The equation now simplifies to 2y + 6 = 24, which is true
