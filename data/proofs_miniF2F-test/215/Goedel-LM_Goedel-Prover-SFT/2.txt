  To solve for \( y \) in the arithmetic sequence \( y + 6 \), \( 12 \), \( y \), we start by using the given information that the sum of the terms is \( 2 \times 12 \). This simplifies to \( y + 6 + y = 24 \). Combining like terms, we get \( 2y + 6 = 24 \). Subtracting 6 from both sides, we obtain \( 2y = 18 \). Dividing both sides by 2, we find \( y = 9 \).

  -- We start by simplifying the given equation y + 6 + y = 2 * 12.
  have h₁ : y + 6 + y = 24 := by
    -- Substitute the right-hand side of the given equation into the equation.
    linarith
  -- Now we have 2y + 6 = 24. Subtract 6 from both sides to isolate 2y.
  have h₂ : 2 * y = 18 := by
    -- Subtract 6 from both sides of the equation.
    linarith
  -- Finally, divide both sides by 2 to solve for y.
  have h₃ : y = 9 := by
    -- Divide both sides by 2.
    linarith
  -- We have found that y = 9.
