  To find the value of \( y \) in the arithmetic sequence \( y + 6 \), \( 12 \), \( y \), we start by setting up the equation based on the properties of arithmetic sequences. Given that the middle term is \( 12 \), we can express the equation as:
  \[ y + 6 + y = 2 \times 12 \]
  Simplifying this equation:
  \[ 2y + 6 = 24 \]
  Subtracting 6 from both sides:
  \[ 2y = 18 \]
  Dividing both sides by 2:
  \[ y = 9 \]
  Thus, the value of \( y \) is \( 9 \).
