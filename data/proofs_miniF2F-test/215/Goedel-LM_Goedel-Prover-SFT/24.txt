  To solve the problem of finding the value of \( y \) in the arithmetic sequence \( y + 6, 12, y \), we start by using the given condition that the sum of \( y + 6 \) and \( y \) equals twice 12. This can be expressed as:
  \[ y + 6 + y = 2 \times 12 \]
  Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:
  \[ 2y + 6 = 24 \]
  Next, we isolate \( y \) by subtracting 6 from both sides:
  \[ 2y = 18 \]
  Finally, we solve for \( y \) by dividing both sides by 2:
  \[ y = 9 \]
  Thus, the value of \( y \) is 9.

  -- We start by simplifying the given equation y + 6 + y = 2 * 12
  have h₁ : y = 9 := by
    -- We use the given equation to solve for y
    have h₀ : y + 6 + y = 24 := by
      -- Simplify the left-hand side to 2y + 6
      linarith
    -- Subtract 6 from both sides to isolate 2y
    have h₁ : 2 * y = 18 := by
      linarith
    -- Divide both sides by 2 to solve for y
    have h₂ : y = 9 := by
      linarith
    -- We have found that y = 9
    exact h₂
  -- The final result is y = 9
  exact h₁
