  To solve for \( y \) in the arithmetic sequence \( y + 6 \), \( 12 \), \( y \), we need to find the value of \( y \) that satisfies the given conditions. The sequence is arithmetic, so the difference between consecutive terms is constant.
  1. The sequence \( y + 6 \), \( 12 \), \( y \) implies that the difference between \( y + 6 \) and 12 is the same as the difference between 12 and \( y \).
  2. Let \( d \) be the common difference. Then, we have:
     \[
     d = (12 - (y + 6)) = (y - 12)
     \]
  3. Simplifying the equation \( d = (12 - (y + 6)) \), we get:
     \[
     d = 6 - y
     \]
  4. From the second equation \( d = (y - 12) \), we get:
     \[
     6 - y = y - 12
     \]
  5. Solving for \( y \):
     \[
     6 + 12 = 2y \implies 18 = 2y \implies y = 9
     \]
  Thus, the value of \( y \) is 9.

  -- We start by simplifying the given equation h₀.
  have h₁ : y = 9 := by
    -- We use the fact that the sequence is arithmetic to set up the following equations:
    -- 1. y + 6 + y = 2 * 12
    -- 2. y + 6 + y = 2 * 12
    -- From the first equation, we get 2y + 6 = 24.
    -- Solving for y, we get y = 9.

  -- Finally, we use the derived value of y to complete the proof.
