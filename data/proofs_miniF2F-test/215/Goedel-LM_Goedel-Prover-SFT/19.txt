  Given the arithmetic sequence \( y + 6 \), \( 12 \), \( y \), we need to find the value of \( y \). The equation representing the sequence is \( y + 6 + y = 2 \times 12 \). Simplifying this equation, we get \( 2y + 6 = 24 \). Solving for \( y \), we subtract 6 from both sides to get \( 2y = 18 \). Dividing both sides by 2, we find \( y = 9 \).

    -- Simplify the equation y + 6 + y = 2 * 12 to 2y + 6 = 24.
    have h₂ : 2 * y + 6 = 24 := by linarith
    -- Solve for y by isolating it on one side of the equation.
