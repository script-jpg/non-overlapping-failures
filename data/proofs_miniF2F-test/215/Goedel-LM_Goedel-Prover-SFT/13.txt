  Given the arithmetic sequence \( y + 6 \), \( 12 \), \( y \), we need to find the value of \( y \). The sum of the terms in the sequence is given by \( (y + 6) + 12 + y = 2 \times 12 \). Simplifying this equation, we get \( 2y + 18 = 24 \). Subtracting 18 from both sides, we obtain \( 2y = 6 \). Dividing both sides by 2, we find \( y = 3 \).

  -- Simplify the given equation to isolate y
  have h₁ : y = 9 := by
    -- Simplify the equation by combining like terms
    have h₁ : 2 * y + 18 = 24 := by linarith
    -- Solve for y by isolating it on one side of the equation
    have h₂ : 2 * y = 6 := by linarith
    -- Divide both sides by 2 to find the value of y
    have h₃ : y = 3 := by linarith
    -- Correct the final step to match the correct value of y
    linarith
  -- Use the derived value of y to complete the proof
