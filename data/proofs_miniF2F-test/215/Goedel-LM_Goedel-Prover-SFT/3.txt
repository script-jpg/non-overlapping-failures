  Given the arithmetic sequence \( y + 6 \), \( 12 \), and \( y \), we need to find the value of \( y \). The sum of the terms in the sequence is given by \( y + 6 + y = 2 \times 12 \). Simplifying this equation, we get \( 2y + 6 = 24 \). Subtracting 6 from both sides, we obtain \( 2y = 18 \). Dividing both sides by 2, we find \( y = 9 \).

  -- Simplify the given equation to isolate y
  have h₁ : 2 * y + 6 = 24 := by
    linarith
  -- Subtract 6 from both sides to further isolate the term with y
  have h₂ : 2 * y = 18 := by
    linarith
  -- Divide both sides by 2 to solve for y
  have h₃ : y = 9 := by
    linarith
  -- The final result is y = 9
  exact h₃
