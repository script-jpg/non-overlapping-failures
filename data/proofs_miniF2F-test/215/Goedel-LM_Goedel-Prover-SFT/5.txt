  To solve for \( y \) in the arithmetic sequence \( y + 6 \), \( 12 \), \( y \), we start by expressing the sum of the terms in terms of \( y \). The sum of the terms is given by:
  \[ y + 6 + y = 2 \cdot 12 \]
  Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:
  \[ 2y + 6 = 24 \]
  Next, we isolate \( y \) by subtracting 6 from both sides:
  \[ 2y = 18 \]
  Finally, we solve for \( y \) by dividing both sides by 2:
  \[ y = 9 \]

  -- Simplify the given equation to isolate y
  have h₁ : y + 6 + y = 24 := by linarith
  -- Combine like terms to simplify the equation
  have h₂ : 2 * y + 6 = 24 := by linarith
  -- Subtract 6 from both sides to isolate the term with y
  have h₃ : 2 * y = 18 := by linarith
  -- Divide both sides by 2 to solve for y
  have h₄ : y = 9 := by linarith
  -- Conclude the proof
  exact h₄
