  To solve for \( y \) in the arithmetic sequence \( y + 6 \), \( 12 \), \( y \), we start by expressing the sum of the sequence in terms of \( y \). Given that the sum of the sequence is \( 2 \times 12 \), we have:
  \[ y + 6 + y = 2 \times 12 \]
  Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:
  \[ 2y + 6 = 24 \]
  Next, we isolate \( y \) by subtracting 6 from both sides:
  \[ 2y = 24 - 6 \]
  \[ 2y = 18 \]
  Finally, we solve for \( y \) by dividing both sides by 2:
  \[ y = \frac{18}{2} \]
  \[ y = 9 \]
  Thus, the value of \( y \) is 9.
