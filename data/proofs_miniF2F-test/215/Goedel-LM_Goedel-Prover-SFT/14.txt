  Given the arithmetic sequence \( y + 6 \), \( 12 \), and \( y \), we need to determine the value of \( y \). The sequence is defined by the equation \( y + 6 + y = 2 \times 12 \). Simplifying this equation, we combine like terms to get \( 2y + 6 = 24 \). Next, we isolate \( y \) by subtracting 6 from both sides, resulting in \( 2y = 18 \). Finally, we solve for \( y \) by dividing both sides by 2, yielding \( y = 9 \).

  have h₁ : 2 * y + 6 = 24 := by
    linarith
  -- Isolate the term involving y by subtracting 6 from both sides.
  have h₂ : 2 * y = 18 := by
    linarith
  -- Solve for y by dividing both sides by 2.
  have h₃ : y = 9 := by
    linarith
  -- The exact value of y is 9.
