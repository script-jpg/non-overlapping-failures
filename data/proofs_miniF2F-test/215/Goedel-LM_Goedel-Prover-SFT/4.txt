  To solve for \( y \) in the arithmetic sequence \( y + 6 \), \( 12 \), \( y \), we need to ensure that the common difference between consecutive terms is consistent. Given the equation \( y + 6 + y = 2 \times 12 \), we can simplify and solve for \( y \).
  1. Start with the equation \( y + 6 + y = 2 \times 12 \).
  2. Combine like terms to get \( 2y + 6 = 24 \).
  3. Subtract 6 from both sides to isolate the term with \( y \): \( 2y = 18 \).
  4. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( y \): \( y = 9 \).
  Thus, the value of \( y \) is \( 9 \).
