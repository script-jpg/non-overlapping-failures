  To solve for \( y \) in the arithmetic sequence \( y + 6 \), \( 12 \), \( y \), we start by setting up the equation based on the properties of an arithmetic sequence. Given that \( y + 6 + y = 2 \cdot 12 \), we simplify the equation step by step. First, we rewrite the equation to isolate \( y \). Then, we solve for \( y \) using basic algebraic operations.

  -- We start by restating the given equation for clarity.
  have h₁ : y + 6 + y = 2 * 12 := h₀
  -- Simplify the equation by combining like terms.
  have h₂ : 2 * y + 6 = 24 := by linarith
  -- Isolate the term involving y by subtracting 6 from both sides.
  have h₃ : 2 * y = 18 := by linarith
  -- Solve for y by dividing both sides by 2.
  have h₄ : y = 9 := by linarith
  -- The final result is y = 9.
