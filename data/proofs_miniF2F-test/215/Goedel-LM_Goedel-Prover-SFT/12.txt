  Given the arithmetic sequence \( y + 6 \), \( 12 \), \( y \) and the condition that the sum of \( y + 6 \) and \( y \) equals twice the middle term \( 12 \), we need to find the value of \( y \). The equation derived from the condition is \( 2y + 6 = 24 \). Solving for \( y \), we first isolate \( 2y \) by subtracting 6 from both sides, resulting in \( 2y = 18 \). Dividing both sides by 2, we obtain \( y = 9 \).

  -- From the given condition, we have the equation 2y + 6 = 24.
  have h₁ : y = 9 := by
    -- Simplify the equation by isolating 2y.
    have h₁ : 2 * y + 6 = 24 := by linarith
    -- Solve for y by isolating it on one side of the equation.
    have h₂ : y = 9 := by linarith
    -- The value of y is 9.
    exact h₂
  -- The final result is y = 9.
  exact h₁
