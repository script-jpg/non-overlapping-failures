  To solve the problem of finding the value of \( y \) in the arithmetic sequence \( y + 6 \), \( 12 \), \( y \), we start with the given equation \( y + 6 + y = 2 \times 12 \). Simplifying this equation, we get \( 2y + 6 = 24 \). Subtracting 6 from both sides, we obtain \( 2y = 18 \). Dividing both sides by 2, we find \( y = 9 \).

  -- Simplify the given equation to isolate y.
  have h₁ : y + 6 + y = 24 := by
    -- Simplify the left-hand side of the equation.

  -- Solve for y by isolating it on one side of the equation.
  have h₂ : y = 9 := by
    -- Subtract 6 from both sides to simplify further.
