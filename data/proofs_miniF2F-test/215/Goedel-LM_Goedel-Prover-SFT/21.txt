  To solve for \( y \) in the arithmetic sequence \( y + 6 \), \( 12 \), \( y \), we start with the given equation \( y + 6 + y = 2 \times 12 \). Simplifying this equation, we get \( 2y + 6 = 24 \). Subtracting 6 from both sides, we obtain \( 2y = 18 \). Dividing both sides by 2, we find \( y = 9 \).

  -- Start with the given equation: y + 6 + y = 2 * 12
  have h₁ : y + 6 + y = 2 * 12 := by linarith
  -- Simplify the equation: 2y + 6 = 24
  have h₂ : 2 * y + 6 = 24 := by linarith
  -- Subtract 6 from both sides: 2y = 18
  have h₃ : 2 * y = 18 := by linarith
  -- Divide both sides by 2: y = 9
  have h₄ : y = 9 := by linarith
  -- The final result is y = 9
