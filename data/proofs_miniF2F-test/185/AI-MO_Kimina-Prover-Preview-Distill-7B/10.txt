To convert the base 3 number $1222_3$ to base 10, we need to express it as a sum of powers of 3. The number $1222_3$ is represented as:

- The rightmost digit is 2, which represents $2 \times 3^0$ (the $3^0$ place).
- The second digit from the right is 2, which represents $2 \times 3^1$ (the $3^1$ place).
- The third digit from the right is 2, which represents $2 \times 3^2$ (the $3^2$ place).
- The leftmost digit is 1, which represents $1 \times 3^3$ (the $3^3$ place).

So we calculate:
$1222_3 = 1 \times 3^3 + 2 \times 3^2 + 2 \times 3^1 + 2 \times 3^0$
$= 1 \times 27 + 2 \times 9 + 2 \times 3 + 2 \times 1$
$= 27 + 18 + 6 + 2$
$= 53$

In Lean, we can prove this with the `norm_num` tactic, which is powerful enough to compute arithmetic expressions and verify that $1 \times 3^3 + 2 \times 3^2 + 2 \times 3 + 2 = 53$ directly from the definition of exponentiation and multiplication.

Therefore, the final answer is $\boxed{53}$.
