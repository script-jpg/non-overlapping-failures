This Lean 4 proof is determining the age of a man in base 10 given his age in base 3. The digits in base 3 represent the coefficients of the powers of 3, starting from the rightmost digit, which represents $3^0$. The number $1222_3$ is expanded as:

- The rightmost digit is 2, representing $2 \times 3^0 = 2$.
- The next digit is 2, representing $2 \times 3^1 = 6$.
- The next digit is 2, representing $2 \times 3^2 = 18$.
- The leftmost digit is 1, representing $1 \times 3^3 = 27$.

Adding these together: $27 + 18 + 6 + 2 = 53$. Therefore, the man is 53 years old in base 10.

The Lean 4 proof directly calculates this by:
1. Importing the necessary libraries
2. Opening namespaces for common operations
3. Stating the theorem as `1 * 3 ^ 3 + 2 * 3 ^ 2 + 2 * 3 + 2 = 53`
4. Proving it using `norm_num`, which is a tactic that performs numerical calculations and simplifications

The key insight is that each digit in the base 3 number represents the coefficient of a power of 3, starting with $3^0$ on the right. The Lean proof is essentially evaluating $1 \cdot 3^3 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3 + 2$ to get 53, confirming that the father's age is indeed 53 in base 10.
