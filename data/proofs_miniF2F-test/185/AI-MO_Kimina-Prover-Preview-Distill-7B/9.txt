-- First, we need to understand what $1222_{3}$ means in base 10.
  -- The notation $1222_{3}$ represents a number in base 3, where:
  -- - The rightmost digit '2' is the coefficient of $3^0$ (i.e., 2 × 1)
  -- - The next digit '2' is the coefficient of $3^1$ (i.e., 2 × 3)
  -- - The next digit '2' is the coefficient of $3^2$ (i.e., 2 × 9)
  -- - The leftmost digit '1' is the coefficient of $3^3$ (i.e., 1 × 27)

  -- So, $1222_{3}$ = 1 × 27 + 2 × 9 + 2 × 3 + 2 × 1
  -- Let's compute this in Lean 4 to prove it equals 53.
