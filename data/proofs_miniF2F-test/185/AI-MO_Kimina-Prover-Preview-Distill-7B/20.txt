In this Lean 4 solution, the problem is to convert the base 3 number 1222 to base 10. The formal Lean 4 solution begins by importing the necessary libraries:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

Then, the theorem is declared. The claim is that 1 * 3^3 + 2 * 3^2 + 2 * 3 + 2 = 53.

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_85 : 1 * 3 ^ 3 + 2 * 3 ^ 2 + 2 * 3 + 2 = 53 := by
```

Now, to prove this equality, Lean has a built-in tactic called `norm_num` which can compute arithmetic expressions and verify equalities between numbers. This tactic is sufficient to solve the problem, as it can compute the value of the left-hand side expression and check that it equals 53.

```tactics
norm_num
```

The `norm_num` tactic performs numerical calculations and simplifications. It computes:
- 1 * 3^3 = 1 * 27 = 27
- 2 * 3^2 = 2 * 9 = 18
- 2 * 3 = 6
- 2 = 2
- Sum: 27 + 18 + 6 + 2 = 53

Therefore, the formal Lean 4 proof is complete. The father's age is 53 in base ten.
