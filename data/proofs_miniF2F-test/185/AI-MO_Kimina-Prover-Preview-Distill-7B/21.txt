# Solving the Age in Base 3 Problem

We're given that the father's age is $1222_3$ in base 3, and we need to convert it to base 10 to show it's 53. Let's solve this step by step:

First, let's understand what $1222_3$ means in base 3. The number $1222_3$ is represented in base 3, which means:
- The rightmost digit (2) is the coefficient of $3^0 = 1$
- The second digit from the right (2) is the coefficient of $3^1 = 3$
- The third digit from the right (2) is the coefficient of $3^2 = 9$
- The leftmost digit (1) is the coefficient of $3^3 = 27$

So the number $1222_3$ in base 3 is:
$1 \cdot 3^3 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3^1 + 2 \cdot 3^0$

Let's compute each term:
- $1 \cdot 3^3 = 1 \cdot 27 = 27$
- $2 \cdot 3^2 = 2 \cdot 9 = 18$
- $2 \cdot 3^1 = 2 \cdot 3 = 6$
- $2 \cdot 3^0 = 2 \cdot 1 = 2$

Adding these together: $27 + 18 + 6 + 2 = 53$

Now, let's translate this into Lean 4. We need to prove that $1 \cdot 3^3 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3 + 2 = 53$ using Lean's tactics.

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

We've imported the necessary libraries and opened the namespaces we'll need. The `maxHeartbeats 0` option allows Lean to use as many computational resources as needed for this proof.

Now, let's define the theorem:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_85 : 1 * 3 ^ 3 + 2 * 3 ^ 2 + 2 * 3 + 2 = 53 := by
```

We've declared the theorem with the statement we want to prove: $1 \cdot 3^3 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3 + 2 = 53$.

Now we need to prove this equality. This is a straightforward calculation that can be verified directly by arithmetic:

- $3^3 = 27$, so $1 \cdot 27 = 27$
- $3^2 = 9$, so $2 \cdot 9 = 18$
- $3^1 = 3$, so $2 \cdot 3 = 6$
- $3^0 = 1$, so $2 \cdot 1 = 2$
- Summing these: $27 + 18 + 6 + 2 = 53$

In Lean, we can prove this equality directly using the `norm_num` tactic, which is designed to solve arithmetic goals:

```tactics
norm_num
```

The `norm_num` tactic performs numerical calculations and simplifications. When applied to our goal, it:
1. Computes $1 * 3^3 = 27$
2. Computes $2 * 3^2 = 18$
3. Computes $2 * 3 = 6$
4. Computes $2$
5. Sums these to get $27 + 18 + 6 + 2 = 53$
6. Verifies that this equals 53

This completes the proof. The `norm_num` tactic is powerful for goals involving concrete arithmetic calculations, as it can compute the actual numerical value and check if it matches the expected result.

Therefore, we've formally verified that $1222_3$ in base 3 is indeed 53 in base 10, confirming the father's age is 53.
