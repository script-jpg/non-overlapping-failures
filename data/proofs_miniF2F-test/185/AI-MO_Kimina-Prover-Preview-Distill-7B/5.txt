-- Because $1222_{3}$ is the sum $1111_{3}$ + $111_{3}$ + $11_{3}$ + $1_{3}$,
  -- that is, $3^{3}$ + $3^{2}$ + $3$ + 1, it is 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40 in base ten.

This Lean 4 code is proving that the base 3 number 1222 is equal to 53 in base 10. The number 1222 in base 3 means $1 \cdot 3^3 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3 + 2$.

Let's compute this:
- $1 \cdot 3^3 = 1 \cdot 27 = 27$
- $2 \cdot 3^2 = 2 \cdot 9 = 18$
- $2 \cdot 3 = 2 \cdot 3 = 6$
- $2 = 2$
Adding these: $27 + 18 + 6 + 2 = 53$

The Lean proof is using the `norm_num` tactic to compute this arithmetic expression directly. The `norm_num` tactic is powerful for solving goals involving concrete arithmetic calculations. It will evaluate $1 \cdot 3^3 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3 + 2$ to 53 and verify that the equality holds.

So the complete Lean 4 proof is:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

```

Now we need to state the theorem:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_85 : 1 * 3 ^ 3 + 2 * 3 ^ 2 + 2 * 3 + 2 = 53 := by
```

The theorem statement is directly expressing the base 3 number 1222 as a base 10 arithmetic expression. The `*` operator is multiplication and the `^` operator is exponentiation, so this is correctly representing $1 \cdot 3^3 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3 + 2$.

Now we need to prove this equality. As it is a direct arithmetic calculation, Lean's `norm_num` tactic will be able to solve it:

```tactics
norm_num
```

The `norm_num` tactic is computing the left-hand side expression:
- $1 \cdot 3^3 = 27$
- $2 \cdot 3^2 = 18$
- $2 \cdot 3 = 6$
- $2 = 2$
- Total: $27 + 18 + 6 + 2 = 53$

Since 53 = 53 is true, the goal is solved.

Therefore, the complete proof is very simple because the statement is a direct arithmetic computation. The Lean proof is confirming that the base 3 number 1222 is indeed 53 in base 10.
