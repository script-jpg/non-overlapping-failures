In this Lean 4 solution, we are tasked with converting the given base 3 number $1222_3$ to base 10 and proving it equals 53. The Lean code is remarkably concise:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

The necessary libraries are imported, and the configuration is set so Lean's automation can work effectively. We're importing Mathlib for mathematical tools and Aesop as an automated proof strategy. The `maxHeartbeats 0` line allows Lean to perform as many proof steps as needed, which is useful for calculations that might be tedious for a human.

Now let's define the theorem:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_85 : 1 * 3 ^ 3 + 2 * 3 ^ 2 + 2 * 3 + 2 = 53 := by
```

The theorem statement directly represents the base 3 number $1222_3$ in base 10. In base 3, the digits represent coefficients of powers of 3, starting from the rightmost digit, which is the $3^0$ place. So $1222_3$ is:
- 1 × $3^3$ (the leftmost digit is in the $3^3$ place)
- 2 × $3^2$
- 2 × $3^1$ (middle digit is in the $3^1$ place)
- 2 × $3^0$ (rightmost digit is in the $3^0$ place)

The Lean code is now set up to verify this equality. Since this is a direct arithmetic calculation, Lean can solve it directly:

```tactics
ring
```

The `ring` tactic is powerful enough to solve arithmetic goals automatically. It performs the calculations:
- $3^3 = 27$, so 1 × 27 = 27
- $3^2 = 9$, so 2 × 9 = 18
- $3^1 = 3$, so 2 × 3 = 6
- $3^0 = 1$, so 2 × 1 = 2

Adding these results: 27 + 18 + 6 + 2 = 53.

Therefore, the proof is complete. The Lean code has shown that the base 3 number $1222_3$ converts to 53 in base 10.

This example demonstrates how Lean can be used to verify simple arithmetic calculations in different number bases. The approach is to express the number in base 10 as a sum of its digits multiplied by the appropriate powers of the base, and then use Lean's arithmetic capabilities to compute the result.
