The problem asks us to convert the base 3 number $1222_3$ to base 10 and prove it equals 53. 

To convert $1222_3$ to base 10, we evaluate it as:
$1 \cdot 3^3 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3^1 + 2 \cdot 3^0 = 1 \cdot 27 + 2 \cdot 9 + 2 \cdot 3 + 2 \cdot 1 = 27 + 18 + 6 + 2 = 53$

The Lean proof is straightforward because it's a direct computation. The `ring` tactic is powerful enough to solve arithmetic goals involving natural numbers. 

Let's analyze why the Lean code is written as it is:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

These are standard imports for mathematical libraries in Lean. The `maxHeartbeats 0` option is set to allow Lean's automation to work as hard as needed for this proof.

Now we need to define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_85 : 1 * 3 ^ 3 + 2 * 3 ^ 2 + 2 * 3 + 2 = 53 := by 
```

This theorem statement directly represents the mathematical expression we need to evaluate. In Lean, we can prove this equality using the `norm_num` tactic, which is designed for solving arithmetic goals:

```tactics
norm_num
```

The `norm_num` tactic computes the left-hand side expression:
- $1 \cdot 3^3 = 1 \cdot 27 = 27$
- $2 \cdot 3^2 = 2 \cdot 9 = 18$
- $2 \cdot 3 = 6$
- $2$
- Sum: $27 + 18 + 6 + 2 = 53$

Therefore, it successfully proves that $1 \cdot 3^3 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3 + 2 = 53$.

The Lean proof is complete and demonstrates how Lean's automation can verify simple arithmetic facts. The proof is elegant in its simplicity, as it leverages Lean's built-in computation capabilities to directly solve the arithmetic problem.

The key insight is that $1222_3$ in base 3 is equal to $1 \cdot 3^3 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3 + 2 \cdot 1 = 27 + 18 + 6 + 2 = 53$ in base 10, which matches the boxed answer.
