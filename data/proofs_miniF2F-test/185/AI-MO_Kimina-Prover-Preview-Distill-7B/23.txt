-- The problem asks to convert the number $1222_{3}$ from base 3 to base 10.
  -- To solve this, we need to evaluate 1 * 3^3 + 2 * 3^2 + 2 * 3 + 2.
  -- Let's calculate each term individually:
  -- 1 * 3^3 = 1 * 27 = 27
  -- 2 * 3^2 = 2 * 9 = 18
  -- 2 * 3 = 6
  -- Adding these up: 27 + 18 + 6 + 2 = 53
