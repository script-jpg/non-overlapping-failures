-- The above mentioned problem was about representing ages in different bases.
  -- My father's age is $1222_{3}$ in base three, and we need to convert it to base ten.
  -- Here, the base is three, and we have four digits.
  -- The place values are $3^3$, $3^2$, $3$, and $1$ (from right to left).
  -- The digits are 1, 2, 2, and 2.
  -- Therefore, the base ten representation is $1\times 3^3 + 2 \times 3^2 + 2 \times 3 + 2$.
  -- The problem asks us to show that this is equal to 53.
