When we interpret $1222_3$ as a base 3 number, we get $1 \cdot 3^3 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3 + 2 = 1 \cdot 27 + 2 \cdot 9 + 2 \cdot 3 + 2 = 27 + 18 + 6 + 2 = 53$. The Lean proof is straightforward because we can directly compute this equality using Lean's computational tactics.

The proof uses `norm_num` to automatically compute the arithmetic expression. This tactic is powerful enough to evaluate arithmetic goals involving concrete numbers. It will compute $1 \cdot 3^3$ as 27, $2 \cdot 3^2$ as 18, $2 \cdot 3$ as 6, and then add them with 2 to get 53. This establishes the equality $1222_3 = 53_{10}$.

The key insight is that $1222_3$ is a base 3 number where:
- The rightmost digit (2) represents $2 \cdot 3^0$ (units place)
- The second digit from the right (2) represents $2 \cdot 3^1$ (threes place)
- The third digit from the right (2) represents $2 \cdot 3^2$ (nin'es place)
- The leftmost digit (1) represents $1 \cdot 3^3$ (twenty-sevens place)

Adding these up as we did before gives us 53.

Therefore, my father is 53 years old in base ten.
