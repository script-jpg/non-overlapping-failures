This Lean 4 proof is remarkably concise. The problem asks us to convert the base 3 number $1222_3$ to base 10 and verify it equals 53. 

To understand what's happening, let's break down the Lean code:

1. The theorem statement `mathd_numbertheory_85` claims that $1 \cdot 3^3 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3 + 2 = 53$.
2. The comment explains the context of the problem: interpreting $1222_3$ (a base 3 number) as a base 10 expression.
3. The proof uses `norm_num`, a powerful tactic in Lean that solves arithmetic goals by computation.

Let's verify the calculation manually:
- $1 \cdot 3^3 = 1 \cdot 27 = 27$
- $2 \cdot 3^2 = 2 \cdot 9 = 18$
- $2 \cdot 3 = 2 \cdot 3 = 6$
- $2 = 2$
- Sum: $27 + 18 + 6 + 2 = 53$

The `norm_num` tactic performs these calculations automatically. It:
1. Evaluates each power of 3
2. Multiplies by the coefficients
3. Sums the results
4. Verifies the equality with 53

The proof is complete. The Lean 4 code correctly shows that the base 3 number $1222_3$ converts to 53 in base 10.
