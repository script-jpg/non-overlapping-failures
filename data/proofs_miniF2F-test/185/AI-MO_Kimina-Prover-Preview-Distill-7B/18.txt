This theorem is a straightforward arithmetic calculation. To convert the base-3 number $1222_3$ to base-10, we evaluate:

- $1 \cdot 3^3 = 1 \cdot 27 = 27$
- $2 \cdot 3^2 = 2 \cdot 9 = 18$
- $2 \cdot 3^1 = 2 \cdot 3 = 6$
- $2 \cdot 3^0 = 2 \cdot 1 = 2$

Adding these together: $27 + 18 + 6 + 2 = 53$

The Lean proof uses `rfl` (reflexivity) to prove that the two sides of the equation are definitionally equal. This is because Lean can compute both sides and verify that they evaluate to the same value.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{53}$.
