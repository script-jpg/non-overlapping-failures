-- The proof is trivial, as we only need to compute the value of $1222_{3}$ in base 10.
  -- We break the problem into smaller steps, and use `calc` to show each step.
  calc
    -- Step 1: Expand $1222_{3}$ using powers of three
    1 * 3 ^ 3 + 2 * 3 ^ 2 + 2 * 3 + 2 = 1 * 27 + 2 * 9 + 2 * 3 + 2 := by ring
    -- Step 2: Calculate each term
    _ = 27 + 18 + 6 + 2 := by ring
    -- Step 3: Sum the terms to get the final result
    _ = 53 := by ring
