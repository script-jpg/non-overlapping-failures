  To show that the number \(1222_3\) in base three represents the number 53 in base ten, we need to convert the base three number to base ten. This is done by expanding the base three number using its positional values and then summing the results.
  Given the base three number \(1222_3\), we can express it as:
  \[ 1 \cdot 3^3 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3 + 2 \]
  Calculating each term:
  \[ 1 \cdot 3^3 = 1 \cdot 27 = 27 \]
  \[ 2 \cdot 3^2 = 2 \cdot 9 = 18 \]
  \[ 2 \cdot 3 = 2 \cdot 3 = 6 \]
  \[ 2 = 2 \]
  Summing these values:
  \[ 27 + 18 + 6 + 2 = 53 \]
  Thus, the base three number \(1222_3\) is equivalent to the base ten number 53.
