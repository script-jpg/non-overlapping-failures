  To determine the age of my father in base ten, we need to convert his age from base three to base ten. The given age in base three is \(1222_3\). We can convert this number by expanding it in terms of powers of 3 and summing the results. Specifically, we have:
  \[ 1222_3 = 1 \cdot 3^3 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3 + 2 \]
  Calculating each term individually:
  \[ 1 \cdot 3^3 = 1 \cdot 27 = 27 \]
  \[ 2 \cdot 3^2 = 2 \cdot 9 = 18 \]
  \[ 2 \cdot 3 = 2 \cdot 3 = 6 \]
  \[ 2 = 2 \]
  Adding these values together:
  \[ 27 + 18 + 6 + 2 = 53 \]
  Thus, the father's age in base ten is 53.
