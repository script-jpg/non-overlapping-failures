  To solve the problem of converting the base three number \(1222_3\) to base ten, we need to evaluate the expression \(1 \cdot 3^3 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3 + 2\). We can break this down step by step:
  1. Calculate \(3^3\):
     \[
     3^3 = 27
     \]
  2. Calculate \(3^2\):
     \[
     3^2 = 9
     \]
  3. Multiply the results by 1 and 2 respectively:
     \[
     1 \cdot 27 = 27
     \]
     \[
     2 \cdot 9 = 18
     \]
  4. Add the results together along with the additional 2:
     \[
     27 + 18 + 2 = 53
     \]
  Thus, the base ten equivalent of \(1222_3\) is 53.
