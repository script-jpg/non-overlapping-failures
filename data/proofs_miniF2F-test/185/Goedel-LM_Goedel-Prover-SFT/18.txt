  To solve the problem, we need to convert the given number from base three to base ten. The number \(1222_3\) in base three is represented as \(1 \cdot 3^3 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3 + 2\). We will compute each term step by step and then sum them up to find the base ten equivalent.
  1. Compute \(1 \cdot 3^3\):
     \[
     1 \cdot 3^3 = 1 \cdot 27 = 27
     \]
  2. Compute \(2 \cdot 3^2\):
     \[
     2 \cdot 3^2 = 2 \cdot 9 = 18
     \]
  3. Compute \(2 \cdot 3\):
     \[
     2 \cdot 3 = 6
     \]
  4. The constant term is \(2\).
  Now, sum all these values:
  \[
  27 + 18 + 6 + 2 = 53
  \]
  Thus, the base ten equivalent of \(1222_3\) is \(53\).
