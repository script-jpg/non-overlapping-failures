  To determine the age of My father in base ten, we need to convert the given number from base three to base ten. The number \(1222_3\) in base three is represented as \(1 \cdot 3^3 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3 + 2\). We will compute this expression step by step to verify that it equals 53.
  1. Calculate \(3^3\):
     \[
     3^3 = 27
     \]
  2. Calculate \(3^2\):
     \[
     3^2 = 9
     \]
  3. Substitute these values into the expression:
     \[
     1 \cdot 27 + 2 \cdot 9 + 2 \cdot 3 + 2
     \]
  4. Perform the multiplications:
     \[
     1 \cdot 27 = 27
     \]
     \[
     2 \cdot 9 = 18
     \]
     \[
     2 \cdot 3 = 6
     \]
  5. Add these results together:
     \[
     27 + 18 + 6 + 2 = 53
     \]
  Thus, the age of My father in base ten is indeed 53.

  -- We need to verify that the expression 1 * 3 ^ 3 + 2 * 3 ^ 2 + 2 * 3 + 2 equals 53.
  -- This can be done by simplifying the expression step by step.
  norm_num [Nat.succ_mul, Nat.pow_succ, Nat.pow_zero, Nat.pow_succ]
  -- The `norm_num` tactic is used to perform numerical normalization, which will simplify the expression to 53.
  -- The `Nat.succ_mul` and `Nat.pow_succ` lemmas help in simplifying the expression further.
  -- The `Nat.pow_zero` lemma is used to handle the base case of the power.
  -- The `Nat.pow_succ` lemma is used to handle the power of the successor.
