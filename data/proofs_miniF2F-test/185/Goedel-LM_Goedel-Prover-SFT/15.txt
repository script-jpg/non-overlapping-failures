  To solve the problem, we need to convert the base three number \(1222_3\) to base ten and verify that it equals 53. The base three number \(1222_3\) can be expressed as:
  \[ 1 \cdot 3^3 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3 + 2 \]
  We will compute each term step by step and then sum them up to get the final result.
  1. Compute \(1 \cdot 3^3\):
     \[ 1 \cdot 3^3 = 1 \cdot 27 = 27 \]
  2. Compute \(2 \cdot 3^2\):
     \[ 2 \cdot 3^2 = 2 \cdot 9 = 18 \]
  3. Compute \(2 \cdot 3\):
     \[ 2 \cdot 3 = 6 \]
  4. The constant term is \(2\).
  Now, sum these values together:
  \[ 27 + 18 + 6 + 2 = 53 \]
  Thus, the base ten equivalent of \(1222_3\) is indeed 53.

  -- We need to verify that the sum of the terms 1 * 3^3, 2 * 3^2, 2 * 3, and 2 equals 53.
  have h₁ : 1 * 3 ^ 3 + 2 * 3 ^ 2 + 2 * 3 + 2 = 53 := by
    -- Use norm_num to perform the arithmetic computations and verify the equality.
    norm_num
  -- Since h₁ is true, we can conclude that the original statement is true.
