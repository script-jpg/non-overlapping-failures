  To determine the age of My father in base ten, we start by converting the given number from base three to base ten. The number \(1222_3\) can be expressed as:
  \[ 1 \cdot 3^3 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3 + 2 \]
  We need to compute this expression step by step:
  1. Calculate \(3^3\):
     \[ 3^3 = 27 \]
  2. Calculate \(3^2\):
     \[ 3^2 = 9 \]
  3. Multiply each term by the corresponding power of 3:
     \[ 1 \cdot 27 = 27 \]
     \[ 2 \cdot 9 = 18 \]
     \[ 2 \cdot 3 = 6 \]
     \[ 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \]
  4. Sum the results:
     \[ 27 + 18 + 6 + 2 = 53 \]
  Thus, the age of My father in base ten is \(53\).
