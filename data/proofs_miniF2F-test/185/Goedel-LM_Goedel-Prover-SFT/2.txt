  To prove that the number \(1222_3\) in base three represents 53 in base ten, we need to convert the base three number to base ten. This is done by expanding the base three number using its positional values and summing the results. Specifically, for \(1222_3\):
  1. The digit 1 is in the \(3^3\) place, so it contributes \(1 \cdot 3^3\).
  2. The digit 2 is in the \(3^2\) place, so it contributes \(2 \cdot 3^2\).
  3. The digit 2 is in the \(3^1\) place, so it contributes \(2 \cdot 3^1\).
  4. The digit 2 is in the \(3^0\) place, so it contributes \(2 \cdot 3^0\).
  Summing these contributions gives:
  \[ 1 \cdot 3^3 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3^1 + 2 \cdot 3^0 \]
  Calculating each term:
  \[ 1 \cdot 27 = 27 \]
  \[ 2 \cdot 9 = 18 \]
  \[ 2 \cdot 3 = 6 \]
  \[ 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \]
  Adding these results together:
  \[ 27 + 18 + 6 + 2 = 53 \]
  Thus, the base three number \(1222_3\) converts to 53 in base ten.
