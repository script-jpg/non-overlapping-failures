  To solve the problem, we need to convert the base three number \(1222_3\) to base ten. This is done by expanding the number in terms of powers of 3 and then calculating the sum of the results.
  1. Start with the base three number \(1222_3\).
  2. Expand it as \(1 \cdot 3^3 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3 + 2\).
  3. Calculate each term individually:
     - \(1 \cdot 3^3 = 1 \cdot 27 = 27\)
     - \(2 \cdot 3^2 = 2 \cdot 9 = 18\)
     - \(2 \cdot 3 = 6\)
     - The constant term is \(2\).
  4. Sum these values: \(27 + 18 + 6 + 2 = 53\).
  Thus, the base ten equivalent of \(1222_3\) is 53.
