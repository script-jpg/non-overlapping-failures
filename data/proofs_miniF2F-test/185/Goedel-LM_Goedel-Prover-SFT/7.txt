  To show that the number \(1222_3\) in base three represents the age of the person as 53 in base ten, we need to convert the base three number to base ten. This is done by expanding the number in terms of powers of 3 and summing the results. Specifically, we have:
  \[ 1222_3 = 1 \cdot 3^3 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3 + 2 \]
  Calculating each term:
  \[ 1 \cdot 3^3 = 1 \cdot 27 = 27 \]
  \[ 2 \cdot 3^2 = 2 \cdot 9 = 18 \]
  \[ 2 \cdot 3 = 2 \cdot 3 = 6 \]
  \[ 2 = 2 \]
  Summing these values:
  \[ 27 + 18 + 6 + 2 = 53 \]
  Thus, the base three number \(1222_3\) converts to the base ten number 53.
