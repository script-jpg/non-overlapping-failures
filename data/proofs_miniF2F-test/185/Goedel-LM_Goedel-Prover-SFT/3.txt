  To show that the number \(1222_3\) in base three equals 53 in base ten, we need to convert the base three number to base ten. This can be done by expanding the number using powers of 3 and summing the results. Specifically, we have:
  \[ 1222_3 = 1 \cdot 3^3 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3 + 2 \]
  We then compute each term:
  \[ 1 \cdot 3^3 = 1 \cdot 27 = 27 \]
  \[ 2 \cdot 3^2 = 2 \cdot 9 = 18 \]
  \[ 2 \cdot 3 = 2 \cdot 3 = 6 \]
  Adding these values together:
  \[ 27 + 18 + 6 + 2 = 53 \]
  Thus, the base three number \(1222_3\) equals 53 in base ten.
