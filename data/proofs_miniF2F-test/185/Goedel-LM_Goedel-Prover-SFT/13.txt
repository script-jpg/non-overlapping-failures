  To determine the age of my father in base ten, we start by converting the given base three number \(1222_3\) to base ten. The base three number \(1222_3\) can be expanded as follows:
  \[ 1 \cdot 3^3 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3 + 2 \]
  Calculating each term individually:
  \[ 1 \cdot 3^3 = 1 \cdot 27 = 27 \]
  \[ 2 \cdot 3^2 = 2 \cdot 9 = 18 \]
  \[ 2 \cdot 3 = 6 \]
  Adding these values together:
  \[ 27 + 18 + 6 + 2 = 53 \]
  Thus, the age of my father in base ten is 53.

  -- We need to verify that the sum of the terms in base three equals 53.
  -- The terms are 1 * 3^3, 2 * 3^2, 2 * 3, and 2.
  -- We use `norm_num` to perform the arithmetic and verify the equality.
  norm_num [Nat.pow_succ, Nat.pow_zero, Nat.pow_succ, Nat.pow_zero]
  -- `norm_num` simplifies the expression and confirms that the sum is indeed 53.
