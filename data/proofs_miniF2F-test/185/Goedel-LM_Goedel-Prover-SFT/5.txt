  To determine the age of My father in base ten, we need to convert the number \(1222_3\) from base three to base ten. The number \(1222_3\) can be expressed as:
  \[ 1 \cdot 3^3 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3 + 2 \]
  Calculating each term individually:
  \[ 1 \cdot 3^3 = 1 \cdot 27 = 27 \]
  \[ 2 \cdot 3^2 = 2 \cdot 9 = 18 \]
  \[ 2 \cdot 3 = 2 \cdot 3 = 6 \]
  \[ 2 = 2 \]
  Adding these values together:
  \[ 27 + 18 + 6 + 2 = 53 \]
  Thus, the age of My father in base ten is 53.

  -- We need to verify that the sum of the terms equals 53.
  -- The terms are 1 * 3^3, 2 * 3^2, 2 * 3, and 2.
  -- Calculate each term individually and sum them up.
