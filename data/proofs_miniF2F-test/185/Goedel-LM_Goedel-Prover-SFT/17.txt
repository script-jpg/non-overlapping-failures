  To show that the number \(1222_3\) in base three equals \(53\) in base ten, we start by expressing \(1222_3\) in its expanded form in base ten. The number \(1222_3\) can be written as:
  \[ 1 \cdot 3^3 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3 + 2 \]
  Calculating each term individually:
  \[ 1 \cdot 27 = 27 \]
  \[ 2 \cdot 9 = 18 \]
  \[ 2 \cdot 3 = 6 \]
  Adding these values together:
  \[ 27 + 18 + 6 + 2 = 53 \]
  Thus, the number \(1222_3\) in base ten is indeed \(53\).

  -- Use `norm_num` tactic to verify the arithmetic expression.
  norm_num
  -- The `norm_num` tactic will automatically simplify the expression 1 * 3 ^ 3 + 2 * 3 ^ 2 + 2 * 3 + 2 to 53.
  -- Since the result is already verified, `norm_num` will not need to be used again.
