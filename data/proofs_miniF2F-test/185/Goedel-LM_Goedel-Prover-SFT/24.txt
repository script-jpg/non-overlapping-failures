  To determine the age of the father in base ten, we need to convert the base three number \(1222_3\) to base ten. The base three number \(1222_3\) can be expressed as:
  \[ 1 \cdot 3^3 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3 + 2 \]
  Calculating each term individually:
  \[ 1 \cdot 3^3 = 1 \cdot 27 = 27 \]
  \[ 2 \cdot 3^2 = 2 \cdot 9 = 18 \]
  \[ 2 \cdot 3 = 2 \cdot 3 = 6 \]
  Adding these values together:
  \[ 27 + 18 + 6 + 2 = 53 \]
  Thus, the age of the father in base ten is \(53\).

  -- We need to show that the sum of the products of each digit with its corresponding power of 3 equals 53.
  apply Eq.symm
  -- Simplify the expression using algebraic properties to show that the sum is indeed 53.
