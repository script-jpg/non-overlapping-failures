  To show that the age of My father in base ten is 53, we start by expressing the age in base three. The age is given as \(1222_3\). We need to convert this number from base three to base ten. This is done by expanding the number in terms of powers of 3 and summing the results. Specifically, we have:
  \[ 1222_3 = 1 \cdot 3^3 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3 + 2 \]
  Calculating each term individually:
  \[ 1 \cdot 3^3 = 1 \cdot 27 = 27 \]
  \[ 2 \cdot 3^2 = 2 \cdot 9 = 18 \]
  \[ 2 \cdot 3 = 6 \]
  \[ 2 = 2 \]
  Adding these values together:
  \[ 27 + 18 + 6 + 2 = 53 \]
  Thus, the age of My father in base ten is indeed 53.

  -- We need to verify that the sum of the products of each digit with its corresponding power of 3 equals 53.
  -- Specifically, we need to show that:
  -- 1 * 3^3 + 2 * 3^2 + 2 * 3 + 2 = 53
