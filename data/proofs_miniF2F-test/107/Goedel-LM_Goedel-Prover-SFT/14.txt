  To determine how many integers are in the solution set of \( |x - 2| \leq 5.6 \), we need to find the range of integers \( x \) that satisfy this inequality. The inequality \( |x - 2| \leq 5.6 \) can be split into two parts:
  \[ -5.6 \leq x - 2 \leq 5.6 \]
  Adding 2 to all parts of the inequality, we get:
  \[ -3.6 \leq x \leq 7.6 \]
  Since \( x \) must be an integer, we count the integers within this range. The integers in the interval \([-3.6, 7.6]\) are \(-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\). There are 11 such integers.

    -- To find the exact elements of S, we solve the inequality |n - 2| ≤ 5.6.
    -- This inequality can be split into two parts: -5.6 ≤ n - 2 ≤ 5.6.
    -- Adding 2 to all parts, we get -3.6 ≤ n ≤ 7.6.
    -- Since n must be an integer, the possible values of n are -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
