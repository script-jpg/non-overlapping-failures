  To determine the number of integers in the solution set of \( |x - 2| \leq 5.6 \), we start by identifying the range of integers \( x \) that satisfy this inequality. The inequality \( |x - 2| \leq 5.6 \) can be rewritten as \( -5.6 \leq x - 2 \leq 5.6 \). Adding 2 to all parts of the inequality, we get \( -3.6 \leq x \leq 7.6 \). Since \( x \) must be an integer, we consider the integers within this range: \( -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \). Counting these integers, we find there are 11 integers in total.
