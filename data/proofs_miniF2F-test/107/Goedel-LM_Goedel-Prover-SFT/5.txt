  To determine the number of integers in the solution set of \( |x - 2| \leq 5.6 \), we need to find the integers \( x \) such that \( -5.6 \leq x - 2 \leq 5.6 \). This simplifies to \( -3.6 \leq x \leq 7.6 \). The integers within this range are \( -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \). Counting these integers, we find there are 11 integers in total.

      · linarith -- From -3.6 ≤ x, we get -5.6 ≤ x - 2.
      · linarith -- From x ≤ 7.6, we get x - 2 ≤ 5.6.
  -- Now we know S is the set of integers from -3 to 7, inclusive.
