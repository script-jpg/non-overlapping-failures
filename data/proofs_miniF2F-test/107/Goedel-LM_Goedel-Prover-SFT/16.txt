  To determine the number of integers in the solution set of \( |x - 2| \leq 5.6 \), we need to find the range of integers \( x \) that satisfy this inequality. The inequality \( |x - 2| \leq 5.6 \) can be split into two parts: \( -5.6 \leq x - 2 \leq 5.6 \). Adding 2 to all parts of the inequality, we get:
  \[ -5.6 + 2 \leq x - 2 + 2 \leq 5.6 + 2 \]
  \[ -3.6 \leq x \leq 7.6 \]
  Since \( x \) must be an integer, the possible values of \( x \) range from \(-3\) to \(7\). The integers in this range are \(-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\). Counting these integers, we find there are 11 integers in total.

  -- Now we know S is the interval [-3, 7], we can directly compute its cardinality
