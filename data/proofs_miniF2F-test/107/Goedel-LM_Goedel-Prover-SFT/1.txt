  To determine the number of integers in the solution set of \( |x - 2| \leq 5.6 \), we start by analyzing the inequality. The inequality \( |x - 2| \leq 5.6 \) can be split into two cases:
  \[ -5.6 \leq x - 2 \leq 5.6 \]
  Next, we solve these inequalities for \( x \):
  \[ -5.6 + 2 \leq x \leq 5.6 + 2 \]
  \[ -3.6 \leq x \leq 7.6 \]
  Thus, the integers \( x \) that satisfy this inequality are those within the interval \([-3.6, 7.6]\). The integers within this interval are:
  \[ -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \]
  Counting these integers, we find there are 11 integers in total.

    -- We prove that S is exactly the interval [-3, 7] by showing that an element n is in S if and only if it satisfies -3 ≤ n ≤ 7.

    -- Using the given condition h₀, we know that n is in S if and only if |n - 2| ≤ 5 + 6 / 10.

      -- Given |n - 2| ≤ 5 + 6 / 10, we split it into two inequalities: -5.6 ≤ n - 2 ≤ 5.6.
      -- Solving these inequalities gives us -3.6 ≤ n ≤ 7.6.
      -- Since n is an integer, the smallest possible value for n is -3 and the largest is 7.

      -- Given -3 ≤ n ≤ 7, we need to show that |n - 2| ≤ 5 + 6 / 10.
      -- Since n is in the interval [-3, 7], we have -3 ≤ n ≤ 7.
      -- We can split these inequalities into two parts: -5.6 ≤ n - 2 ≤ 5.6.

  -- Now we know that S is exactly the interval [-3, 7], so its cardinality is 11.
