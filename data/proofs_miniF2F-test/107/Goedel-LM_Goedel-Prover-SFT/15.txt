  To determine the number of integers in the solution set of \( |x - 2| \leq 5.6 \), we start by analyzing the inequality. The absolute value inequality \( |x - 2| \leq 5.6 \) can be split into two separate inequalities:
  \[ -5.6 \leq x - 2 \leq 5.6 \]
  By solving these inequalities, we get:
  \[ -5.6 + 2 \leq x \leq 5.6 + 2 \]
  \[ -3.6 \leq x \leq 7.6 \]
  Since \( x \) must be an integer, we count the integers within this range:
  \[ -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \]
  There are 11 integers in this list, thus the cardinality of the solution set is 11.
