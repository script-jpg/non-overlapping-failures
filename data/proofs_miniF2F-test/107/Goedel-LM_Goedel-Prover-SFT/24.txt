  To determine how many integers are in the solution set of \( |x - 2| \leq 5.6 \), we need to find the integers \( x \) such that \( -5.6 \leq x - 2 \leq 5.6 \). This simplifies to \( -3.6 \leq x \leq 7.6 \). The integers within this range are \( -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \). There are 11 such integers.
