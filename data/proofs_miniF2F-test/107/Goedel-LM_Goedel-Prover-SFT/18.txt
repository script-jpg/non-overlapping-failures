  To determine the number of integers in the solution set of \( |x - 2| \leq 5.6 \), we start by analyzing the inequality. The absolute value inequality \( |x - 2| \leq 5.6 \) can be split into two separate inequalities:
  \[ -5.6 \leq x - 2 \leq 5.6 \]
  By solving these inequalities for \( x \), we get:
  \[ -5.6 + 2 \leq x \leq 5.6 + 2 \]
  \[ -3.6 \leq x \leq 7.6 \]
  Thus, the integers \( x \) that satisfy this inequality are those within the interval \([-3.6, 7.6]\). The integers within this interval are:
  \[ -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \]
  Counting these integers, we find there are 11 integers in total. Therefore, the cardinality of the set \( S \) of integers satisfying the given inequality is 11.
