  To determine the number of integers in the solution set of \( |x - 2| \leq 5.6 \), we start by analyzing the inequality. The absolute value inequality \( |x - 2| \leq 5.6 \) can be split into two separate inequalities:
  \[ -5.6 \leq x - 2 \leq 5.6 \]
  By solving these inequalities, we get:
  \[ -5.6 + 2 \leq x \leq 5.6 + 2 \]
  \[ -3.6 \leq x \leq 7.6 \]
  The integers within this range are \( -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \). Counting these integers, we find there are 11 integers in total.

    -- We will prove this by showing that an integer n is in S if and only if it is in the interval [-3, 7].

    -- We need to show that n satisfies -5.6 ≤ n - 2 ≤ 5.6 if and only if -3 ≤ n ≤ 7.
    constructor
    -- First, assume n satisfies -5.6 ≤ n - 2 ≤ 5.6.
    intro h
    constructor
    -- From -5.6 ≤ n - 2, we get -3.6 ≤ n.
    linarith [h.1]
    -- From n - 2 ≤ 5.6, we get n ≤ 7.6.
    linarith [h.2]
    -- Now, assume n satisfies -3 ≤ n ≤ 7.
    intro h
    constructor
    -- From -3 ≤ n, we get -5.6 ≤ n - 2.
    linarith [h.1]
    -- From n ≤ 7, we get n - 2 ≤ 5.6.
    linarith [h.2]
  -- Now we know S is the interval [-3, 7], so its cardinality is 11.
