-- We need to show that the set of integers $n$ such that $|n - 2| \leq 5.6$ has cardinality 11.
  -- First, let me analyze what it means for an integer $n$ to satisfy $|n - 2| \leq 5.6$.

    exact abs_le

  -- Therefore, $|n - 2| \leq 5.6$ if and only if $-5.6 \leq n - 2 \leq 5.6$.
  -- Since $n - 2$ is an integer, we can rewrite this as $-5 \leq n - 2 \leq 5$.

  -- Therefore, the set of integers $n$ such that $|n - 2| \leq 5.6$ is exactly the set of integers from -3 to 7 inclusive.

  -- To recap, we've shown that the set of integers $n$ such that $|n - 2| \leq 5.6$ is precisely the set of integers from -3 to 7 inclusive, and that this set has cardinality 11.
