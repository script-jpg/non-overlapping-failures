This theorem statement is asking us to prove that the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is 0. Let's think about this mathematically before diving into the formal proof.

When we divide 54 by 6, we get 54 = 6 × 9 + 0. This means that 54 is exactly divisible by 6, leaving a remainder of 0. In modular arithmetic, we would say that 54 ≡ 0 (mod 6).

In Lean, we can prove this directly using computational methods. The `Nat.ModEq` is a definition that represents the congruence relation in modular arithmetic. When we unfold this definition, Lean will compute the value of 54 % 6 and compare it to 0.

Let's continue with the proof:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

```

We've imported the necessary libraries and opened namespaces for working with mathematical operations. The `maxHeartbeats 0` setting allows Lean to work as long as needed to complete the proof.

Now, let's define our theorem:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_342 : 54 % 6 = 0 := by
```

We have declared our theorem. The remainder operation `%` in Lean corresponds to the modulo operation in mathematics. Our goal is to prove that 54 modulo 6 equals 0.

To prove this, we can use Lean's computational capabilities. When Lean encounters a goal that is purely computational, it can often solve it directly using the `rfl` tactic, which stands for "reflexivity." This tactic proves goals of the form `tactics x = x` where the left and right sides are identical after computation.

In our case, Lean will compute 54 % 6 and find that it equals 0. Then it will verify that 0 = 0, which is trivially true. The `rfl` tactic handles this verification:

```tactics
rfl
```

And that completes our proof! Lean has verified that 54 % 6 = 0, which is exactly what we wanted to prove.

In conclusion, we have formally shown that the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is 0. This matches our mathematical intuition, as 54 = 6 × 9 + 0, meaning 54 is divisible by 6 with no remainder.
