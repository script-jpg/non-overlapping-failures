In number theory, the remainder of a number $a$ when divided by $b$ (denoted as $a \bmod b$) is the non-negative integer $r$ such that $a = bq + r$ for some integer $q$ (the quotient) and $0 \leq r < b$. 

For the specific case of $54 \bmod 6$, we can observe that $54 = 6 \cdot 9 + 0$, where $9$ is the quotient and $0$ is the remainder. Since $0 < 6$, the remainder is indeed $0$. 

Therefore, the remainder of 54 when divided by 6 is 0, as shown by the calculation above.
