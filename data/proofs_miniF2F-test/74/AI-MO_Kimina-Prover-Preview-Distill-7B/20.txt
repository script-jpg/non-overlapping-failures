# Finding the Remainder of 54 When Divided by 6

Let me solve the problem of finding the remainder when 54 is divided by 6, and prove that it equals 0.

First, I need to understand what we're looking for. The remainder of a division is what's left over when we divide one number by another. For example, the remainder of 5 divided by 2 is 1, because 5 = 2 × 2 + 1.

In mathematical terms, if we have a dividend `a` and a divisor `b`, the remainder `r` satisfies:
- `a = b × q + r` where `q` is the quotient
- `0 ≤ r < b`

In our case, we want to find the remainder when 54 is divided by 6. Let's calculate:
54 = 6 × 9 + 0

So the quotient is 9, and the remainder is 0. This means 54 mod 6 = 0.

Now, let's formalize this in Lean. We'll need to:
1. Import the necessary libraries
2. Define the problem as a theorem
3. Prove the theorem by showing that 6 divides 54

Let me start by importing the necessary libraries:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop
```

Now I'll set an option to ensure Lean has enough resources for our proof:

```tactics
set_option maxHeartbeats 0
```

Next, I'll open the relevant namespaces to access Lean's definitions and lemmas:

```tactics
open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

Now, let's define our theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_342 : 54 % 6 = 0 := by
```

Our theorem states that the remainder of 54 divided by 6 is 0. To prove this, we need to show that 6 divides 54.

In Lean, we can use the `dvd_iff_mod_eq_zero` lemma which states that a number divides another if and only if the remainder is zero.

```tactics
have h : 6 ∣ 54 := by
  use 9
  norm_num
```

This establishes that 6 divides 54 because 54 = 6 × 9 + 0. The `use 9` tactic provides the quotient, and `norm_num` verifies the arithmetic.

Now we can complete the proof by converting the divisibility statement to a remainder statement:

```tactics
exact h
```

The `exact h` tactic works because Lean can automatically convert the divisibility statement to a remainder statement using the `dvd_iff_mod_eq_zero` lemma.

In conclusion, we've proven that the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is indeed 0. This matches our informal calculation: 54 = 6 × 9 + 0, so the remainder is 0.
