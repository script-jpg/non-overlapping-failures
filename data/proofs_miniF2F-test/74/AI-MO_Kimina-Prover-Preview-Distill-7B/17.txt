This proof is quite straightforward. We first establish that 6 divides 54 by providing the quotient (9) and verifying that 6 * 9 = 54. Then we apply a lemma that states if a number divides another number, then the remainder of the division is zero. This completes the proof that 54 mod 6 = 0.

The mathematical reasoning is simple: when we divide 54 by 6, we get 9 as the quotient and 0 as the remainder because 54 = 6 * 9 + 0. Therefore, 54 mod 6 = 0.

In Lean, we've formalized this by:
1. Establishing that 6 divides 54
2. Using a library lemma that connects divisibility to zero remainder

This demonstrates how Lean can formalize basic number theory results by leveraging its rich library of mathematical facts.
