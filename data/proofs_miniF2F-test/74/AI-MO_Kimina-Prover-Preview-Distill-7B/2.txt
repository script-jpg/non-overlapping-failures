-- We divide 54 by 6, the remainder is 0.

  decide
```

The theorem is proved by the `decide` tactic, which automatically computes the remainder of 54 divided by 6 and verifies it is 0. This works because Lean's type system can compute concrete arithmetic values at compile time.

The informal reasoning is straightforward: when we divide 54 by 6, we get 9 with no remainder. Therefore, the remainder of 54 mod 6 is 0.

So the complete formal proof is:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat

/-- Determine the remainder of 54 (mod 6). Show that it is 0.-/
theorem mathd_numbertheory_342 : 54 % 6 = 0 := by
  decide
```

This is a simple yet complete formalization of the problem. It demonstrates how Lean can verify basic arithmetic facts like the remainder of a division operation. The `decide` tactic is powerful for these kinds of calculations because it can compute concrete values directly.
