-- We know that 54 = 6 x 9, so it is divisible by 6, and the remainder is 0.

The `norm_num` tactic is perfect here because it can compute numerical expressions, including remainders. It will calculate 54 % 6 and verify that it equals 0. This is a straightforward computational proof that leverages Lean's ability to evaluate arithmetic expressions.

To recap the mathematical reasoning: We want to find the remainder when 54 is divided by 6. We know that 54 = 6 × 9, which means 54 is exactly divisible by 6 with no remainder. Therefore, the remainder is 0. The `norm_num` tactic in Lean is designed to solve these kinds of arithmetic problems automatically, making it the ideal choice for this proof.
