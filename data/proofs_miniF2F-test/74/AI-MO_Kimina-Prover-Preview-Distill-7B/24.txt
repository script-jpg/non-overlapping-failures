-- Show that 54 divided by 6 gives a remainder of 0.

When we divide 54 by 6, we get 9 with no remainder. This means that 54 is divisible by 6, and the remainder is 0. The `norm_num` tactic is powerful enough to compute this basic arithmetic fact about natural numbers. It calculates that 54 = 6 × 9 + 0, so the remainder is indeed 0.

Therefore, the remainder of 54 (mod 6) is 0, which we've formally verified using Lean 4's automation.
