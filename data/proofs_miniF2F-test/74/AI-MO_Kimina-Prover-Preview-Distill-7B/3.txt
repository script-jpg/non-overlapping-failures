When we divide 54 by 6, we get a quotient of 9 and a remainder of 0. This is because 54 = 6 × 9 + 0. The remainder is therefore 0.

The Lean proof is straightforward. We use `norm_num` to compute the value of 54 % 6. The `norm_num` tactic is powerful for arithmetic goals as it can compute concrete values and verify arithmetic facts. In this case, it calculates 54 divided by 6, determines that the quotient is 9 and the remainder is 0, and thus proves that 54 % 6 = 0.

The mathematical reasoning is that 54 is exactly divisible by 6, leaving no remainder. This is because 54 = 6 × 9, so when we divide 54 by 6, we get 9 as the quotient and 0 as the remainder. Therefore, 54 mod 6 = 0.
