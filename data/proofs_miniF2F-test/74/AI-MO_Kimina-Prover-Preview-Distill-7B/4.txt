-- remainder of 54 (mod 6) is 0, because 54 = 9 * 6 + 0

  norm_num
```

This theorem is proven by the `norm_num` tactic, which is powerful for solving arithmetic goals. It is able to compute that 54 mod 6 equals 0 because 54 = 9 * 6 + 0, so the remainder is indeed 0.

The key insight is that when we divide 54 by 6, we get 9 as the quotient and 0 as the remainder. This is because 54 = 6 * 9 + 0, and the remainder must be less than the divisor (6), so 0 is the only possibility.

Therefore, the remainder of 54 (mod 6) is 0.
