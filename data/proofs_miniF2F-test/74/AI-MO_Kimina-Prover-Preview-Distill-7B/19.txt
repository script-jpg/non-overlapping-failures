-- We divide 54 by 6, the remainder is 0, and the quotient is 9.

  exact rfl
```

In Lean 4, we can directly prove that $54 \mod 6 = 0$ using the `rfl` tactic, which stands for "reflexivity". This tactic works because Lean can compute the modulus operation directly: $54 \div 6 = 9$ with no remainder, so $54 \mod 6 = 0$ is true by definition of the modulus operation.

The mathematical reasoning is straightforward: when we divide 54 by 6, we get 9 as the quotient and 0 as the remainder. Therefore, $54 \equiv 0 \pmod{6}$, which means 54 is divisible by 6.

So our complete Lean 4 proof is:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

We've imported the necessary libraries and opened namespaces to access the required definitions and lemmas.

Now we'll state the theorem:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_342 : 54 % 6 = 0 := by 
  exact rfl
```

The proof is complete. Lean's computation confirms that $54 \mod 6 = 0$ is true by reflexivity, as the left and right sides are definitionally equal.

The final answer is indeed $ \boxed{0} $, confirming our Lean proof.
