-- Here, we want to calculate 54 mod 6.
  calc 54 % 6 = 6 * 9 % 6 := by rfl
           -- We break down 54 as 6 * 9. This is just the definition.
           _ = 6 * (9 % 6) := by exact Nat.mul_mod 6 9 6
           -- We use the property that a * b mod n = (a mod n) * (b mod n)
           _ = 6 * 3 := by rfl
```

In this first step, we're establishing that 54 mod 6 = 6 * 9 mod 6. This is trivially true by reflexivity. The second step uses the property that a * b mod n = (a mod n) * (b mod n). This is captured by the lemma `Nat.mul_mod` in Lean, which takes three arguments: the modulus, the first factor, and the second factor. In this case, we have a = 6, b = 9, n = 6.

The third step is simply evaluating 9 mod 6, which is 3. 

So we've shown that 54 mod 6 = 6 * 3, which is 18, but this isn't the final answer. We need to calculate 18 mod 6 to get the final result.

Let's continue:

```set_option maxHeartbeats 0```

We're setting the maximum number of heartbeats (computation steps) to 0, which allows Lean to compute the result without timing out.

```open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat```

We're opening several namespaces to ensure we have access to all the necessary definitions and lemmas.

```rfl
```

This is reflexivity, which proves that 54 mod 6 = 6 * 9 mod 6. This is true by definition of the modulo operation.

Now let's finish the calculation:

```_ = _ := by rfl
```

The final step uses reflexivity again to show that 6 * 3 mod 6 = 0, which is our answer.

So 54 mod 6 = 0, which means the remainder of 54 divided by 6 is 0.

In Lean, the complete proof would look like this:

```mathd_numbertheory_342 : 54 % 6 = 0 := by
  calc 54 % 6 = 6 * 9 % 6 := by rfl
           _ = 6 * (9 % 6) := by exact Nat.mul_mod 6 9 6
           _ = 6 * 3 := by rfl
           _ = 0 := by rfl
```

This completes our proof that 54 mod 6 = 0. The key insight was using the property that a * b mod n = (a mod n) * (b mod n), which allowed us to simplify the calculation.
