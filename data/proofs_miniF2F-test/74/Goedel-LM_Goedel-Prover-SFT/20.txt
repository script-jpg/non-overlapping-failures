  To determine the remainder of 54 when divided by 6, we can use the property of modular arithmetic. Specifically, we need to show that \( 54 \mod 6 = 0 \). This can be verified by checking that 54 is a multiple of 6. Since 54 is indeed a multiple of 6 (as \( 54 = 6 \times 9 \)), the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is 0.
