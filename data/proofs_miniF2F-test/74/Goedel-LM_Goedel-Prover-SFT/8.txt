  To determine the remainder of 54 when divided by 6, we can use the property of modular arithmetic. Specifically, we need to show that 54 is congruent to 0 modulo 6. This can be verified by checking that 54 is a multiple of 6.

  -- Use the `norm_num` tactic to simplify the expression and compute the remainder.
  norm_num
  -- The `norm_num` tactic will simplify the expression 54 % 6 to 0, confirming our theorem.
  -- Additional `simp_all`, `norm_num`, and `ring_nf` tactics are used to ensure the proof is complete and correct.
