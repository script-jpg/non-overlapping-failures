  To determine the remainder of 54 modulo 6, we can use the property that a number is divisible by another if the remainder is zero. Here, we need to show that 54 is divisible by 6. This can be verified by checking the divisibility of 54 by both 2 and 3. Since 54 is divisible by both 2 and 3, it follows that 54 is divisible by 6. Therefore, the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is 0.
