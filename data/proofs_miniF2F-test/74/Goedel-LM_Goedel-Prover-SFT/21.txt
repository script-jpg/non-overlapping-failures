  To determine the remainder of 54 when divided by 6, we can use the property of modular arithmetic. Specifically, we need to show that 54 modulo 6 equals 0. This can be verified by checking that 54 is a multiple of 6.

  -- Use the `simp` tactic to simplify the expression involving the modulus operation.
  -- The `mod_eq_of_lt` lemma is used to assert that the modulus is less than the dividend.
  -- Here, we provide the proof that 6 is less than 54, which is straightforward.
  simp [mod_eq_of_lt (by decide : 6 < 54)]
