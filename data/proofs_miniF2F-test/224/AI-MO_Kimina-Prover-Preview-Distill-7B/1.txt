-- Simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by the common denominator.
  field_simp [sub_ne_zero.2 h₁, sub_ne_zero.2 h₂, sub_ne_zero.2 h₃] at h₄

  ring_nf at h₄

  -- Solve the equation by factorization.
  have h₅ : (x - 13) * (x + 3) = 0 := by linear_combination h₄

  -- Since x > 0, we only have x = 13 as the solution.
