-- We will find the positive solution to the equation and show that it is 13.

  -- First, let's understand the structure of the equation:
  -- We have three fractions with similar denominators, and we need to find when their sum equals 0.

  -- Let's start by analyzing the denominators:
  -- x^2 - 10x - 29
  -- x^2 - 10x - 45
  -- x^2 - 10x - 69

  -- Notice that the difference between the denominators is constant:
  -- (x^2 - 10x - 45) - (x^2 - 10x - 29) = -16
  -- (x^2 - 10x - 69) - (x^2 - 10x - 45) = -24

  -- This suggests a potential approach:
  -- Let's set y = x^2 - 10x, then our equation becomes:
  -- 1/(y-29) + 1/(y-45) - 2/(y-69) = 0

  -- Let's work on simplifying the equation algebraically:
  have h : 1 / (x ^ 2 - 10 * x - 29) + 1 / (x ^ 2 - 10 * x - 45) - 2 / (x ^ 2 - 10 * x - 69) =
    (x - 13) * (1 / (x - 5) + 1 / (x - 9) - 2 / (x - 11)) := by
    ring_nf

  rw [h] at h₄

  -- Now we have (x - 13) * (1/(x-5) + 1/(x-9) - 2/(x-11)) = 0

  -- For a product to be 0, either one of the factors is 0, or the other factor is 0.

  -- Let's first consider the case where x = 13:
  have hx13 : x - 13 = 0 ∨ 1 / (x - 5) + 1 / (x - 9) - 2 / (x - 11) = 0 := by
    cases (mul_eq_zero.mp h₄) with
    | inl h' => left; linarith
    | inr h' => right; linarith

  rcases hx13 with hx13 | hx13

  -- If x - 13 = 0, then x = 13, and we've found our solution.

  · linarith

  -- Now we need to consider the second case: 1/(x-5) + 1/(x-9) - 2/(x-11) = 0

  -- Let's find a common denominator and simplify:
  -- Common denominator: (x-5)(x-9)(x-11)
  -- Numerator: (x-9)(x-11) + (x-5)(x-11) - 2(x-5)(x-9)

  -- Expanding:
  -- (x-9)(x-11) = x^2 - 20x + 99
  -- (x-5)(x-11) = x^2 - 16x + 55
  -- -2(x-5)(x-9) = -2(x^2 - 14x + 45) = -2x^2 + 28x - 90

  -- Summing: x^2 - 20x + 99 + x^2 - 16x + 55 - 2x^2 + 28x - 90 = 54 - 18x

  -- So we get (54 - 18x) / ((x-5)(x-9)(x-11)) = 0

  -- This means 54 - 18x = 0, or x = 3

  have h' : 1 / (x - 5) + 1 / (x - 9) - 2 / (x - 11) = (54 - 18 * x) / ((x - 5) * (x - 9) * (x - 11)) := by

  -- So we have 54 - 18x = 0, which means x = 3

  -- But this contradicts our assumption that x > 0 (and actually, x = 3 doesn't satisfy the original equation)
