  To solve the equation \(\frac{1}{x^2 - 10x - 29} + \frac{1}{x^2 - 10x - 45} - \frac{2}{x^2 - 10x - 69} = 0\), we need to show that \(x = 13\) is the positive solution. We start by ensuring that the denominators are non-zero, which is given by the conditions \(h₁\), \(h₂\), and \(h₃\). We then simplify the equation by clearing the denominators and solving the resulting polynomial equation.
