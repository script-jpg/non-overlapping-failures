  To solve the equation \(\frac{1}{x^2 - 10x - 29} + \frac{1}{x^2 - 10x - 45} - \frac{2}{x^2 - 10x - 69} = 0\), we start by simplifying the given equation. We assume that the denominators are not zero, which is given by the conditions \(x^2 - 10x - 29 \neq 0\), \(x^2 - 10x - 45 \neq 0\), and \(x^2 - 10x - 69 \neq 0\). We then clear the denominators by multiplying through by the common denominator \((x^2 - 10x - 29)(x^2 - 10x - 45)(x^2 - 10x - 69)\). This simplifies the equation to a polynomial form. We then solve this polynomial equation using algebraic manipulations and numerical methods to find that \(x = 13\).
