  To solve the equation \(\frac{1}{x^2 - 10x - 29} + \frac{1}{x^2 - 10x - 45} - \frac{2}{x^2 - 10x - 69} = 0\), we need to show that the positive solution is 13. We start by normalizing the given equation and simplifying it using algebraic manipulations. We then use numerical and algebraic properties to verify that \(x = 13\) is indeed the solution.
