  To solve the equation \(\frac{1}{x^2 - 10x - 29} + \frac{1}{x^2 - 10x - 45} - \frac{2}{x^2 - 10x - 69} = 0\), we start by factoring the denominators. The equation can be rewritten as:
  \[
  \frac{1}{(x - 13)(x + 1)} + \frac{1}{(x - 15)(x + 1)} - \frac{2}{(x - 17)(x + 1)} = 0
  \]
  Next, we combine the fractions over a common denominator:
  \[
  \frac{1}{(x - 13)(x + 1)} + \frac{1}{(x - 15)(x + 1)} - \frac{2}{(x - 17)(x + 1)} = \frac{(x - 15) + (x - 13) - 2(x - 17)}{(x - 13)(x + 1)(x - 15)(x + 1)} = \frac{2x - 42}{(x - 13)(x + 1)(x - 15)(x + 1)}
  \]
  Simplifying the numerator, we get:
  \[
  \frac{2x - 42}{(x - 13)(x + 1)(x - 15)(x + 1)} = \frac{2(x - 21)}{(x - 13)(x + 1)(x - 15)(x + 1)}
  \]
  For the equation to hold, the numerator must be zero, implying:
  \[
  2(x - 21) = 0 \implies x = 21
  \]
  However, this contradicts the given conditions. Therefore, the only valid solution is \(x = 13\).
