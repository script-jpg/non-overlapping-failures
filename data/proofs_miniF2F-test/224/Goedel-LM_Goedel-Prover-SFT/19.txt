  To solve the equation \(\frac{1}{x^2 - 10x - 29} + \frac{1}{x^2 - 10x - 45} - \frac{2}{x^2 - 10x - 69} = 0\), we need to find the positive solution \(x\). The given solution \(x = 13\) is verified by substituting \(x = 13\) into the equation and checking that it satisfies the equation.

  -- We use the given solution x = 13 and verify it by substituting x = 13 into the equation.
  have h₅ : x = 13 := by
    -- Normalize the equation by simplifying the fractions.
    norm_num at h₄
    -- Use linear arithmetic to verify that x = 13 satisfies the equation.
    nlinarith [sq_nonneg (x - 13), sq_nonneg (x + 13)]
  -- Since h₅ is true, we conclude that x = 13.
