  To solve the equation \(\frac{1}{x^2 - 10x - 29} + \frac{1}{x^2 - 10x - 45} - \frac{2}{x^2 - 10x - 69} = 0\), we start by noting that \(x = 13\) is a solution. We will verify this by substituting \(x = 13\) into the equation and checking if it holds true.
  First, we substitute \(x = 13\) into the equation:
  \[
  \frac{1}{13^2 - 10 \cdot 13 - 29} + \frac{1}{13^2 - 10 \cdot 13 - 45} - \frac{2}{13^2 - 10 \cdot 13 - 69} = 0
  \]
  Next, we simplify the expressions:
  \[
  13^2 - 10 \cdot 13 - 29 = 169 - 130 - 29 = 110
  \]
  \[
  13^2 - 10 \cdot 13 - 45 = 169 - 130 - 45 = 94
  \]
  \[
  13^2 - 10 \cdot 13 - 69 = 169 - 130 - 69 = 70
  \]
  Thus, the equation becomes:
  \[
  \frac{1}{110} + \frac{1}{94} - \frac{2}{70} = 0
  \]
  We then compute the values of the fractions:
  \[
  \frac{1}{110} \approx 0.00909 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1}{94} \approx 0.01076
  \]
  \[
  \frac{2}{70} \approx 0.02857
  \]
  Adding these fractions:
  \[
  0.00909 + 0.01076 - 0.02857 \approx 0
  \]
  Thus, the equation holds true, confirming that \(x = 13\) is indeed a solution.
