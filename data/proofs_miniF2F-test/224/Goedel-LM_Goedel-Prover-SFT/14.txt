  To solve the equation \(\frac{1}{x^2 - 10x - 29} + \frac{1}{x^2 - 10x - 45} - \frac{2}{x^2 - 10x - 69} = 0\), we start by noting that the denominators are non-zero due to the constraints \(h_1\), \(h_2\), and \(h_3\). We then simplify the equation by clearing the denominators and solving the resulting polynomial equation. The steps involve algebraic manipulation and simplification, leading to the conclusion that \(x = 13\).
