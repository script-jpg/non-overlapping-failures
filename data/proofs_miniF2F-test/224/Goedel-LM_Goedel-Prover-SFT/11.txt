  Given the equation:
  \[
  \frac{1}{x^2 - 10x - 29} + \frac{1}{x^2 - 10x - 45} - \frac{2}{x^2 - 10x - 69} = 0
  \]
  we need to find the positive solution \( x \) such that \( x = 13 \).
  First, we note that the denominators \( x^2 - 10x - 29 \), \( x^2 - 10x - 45 \), and \( x^2 - 10x - 69 \) are all non-zero due to the constraints \( h₁ \), \( h₂ \), and \( h₃ \).
  Next, we simplify the equation by clearing the denominators using the fact that the denominators are non-zero. This allows us to manipulate the equation algebraically.
  Finally, we solve the resulting equation using algebraic techniques and the given constraints to conclude that \( x = 13 \).
