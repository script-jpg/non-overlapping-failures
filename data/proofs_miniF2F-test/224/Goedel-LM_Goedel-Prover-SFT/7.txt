  To solve the equation \(\frac{1}{x^2 - 10x - 29} + \frac{1}{x^2 - 10x - 45} - \frac{2}{x^2 - 10x - 69} = 0\), we start by noting that \(x = 13\) is a solution. We then verify that \(x = 13\) satisfies the equation by substituting \(x = 13\) into the equation and simplifying.

  -- We know that x = 13 is a solution.
  have h₅ : x = 13 := by
    -- We use the given equation and simplify it.
    apply Eq.symm
    field_simp [h₁, h₂, h₃, sub_eq_zero, sub_ne_zero, not_false_iff] at h₄
    -- Simplify the equation using linear arithmetic.
    nlinarith
  -- Since h₅ is true, we conclude that x = 13.
