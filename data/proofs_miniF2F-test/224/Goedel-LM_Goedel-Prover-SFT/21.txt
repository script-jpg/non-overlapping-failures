  To solve the equation \(\frac{1}{x^2 - 10x - 29} + \frac{1}{x^2 - 10x - 45} - \frac{2}{x^2 - 10x - 69} = 0\), we start by noting that the denominators are non-zero due to the constraints \(x^2 - 10x - 29 \neq 0\), \(x^2 - 10x - 45 \neq 0\), and \(x^2 - 10x - 69 \neq 0\). We then simplify the equation by clearing the denominators using the fact that the denominators are non-zero. This allows us to solve the resulting polynomial equation, which simplifies to a quadratic equation in \(x\). Solving this quadratic equation using algebraic methods, we find that \(x = 13\) is the positive solution.
