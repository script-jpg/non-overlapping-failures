  To solve the equation \(\frac{1}{x^2 - 10x - 29} + \frac{1}{x^2 - 10x - 45} - \frac{2}{x^2 - 10x - 69} = 0\), we need to show that the positive solution is \(x = 13\). We start by ensuring that the denominators are non-zero and then simplify the equation using algebraic manipulations. By clearing the denominators and solving the resulting equation, we find that \(x = 13\) satisfies the equation.
