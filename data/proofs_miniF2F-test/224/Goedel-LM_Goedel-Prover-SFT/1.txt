  To solve the equation \(\frac{1}{x^2 - 10x - 29} + \frac{1}{x^2 - 10x - 45} - \frac{2}{x^2 - 10x - 69} = 0\), we start by noting that the denominators are non-zero due to the constraints \(0 < x\), \(x^2 - 10x - 29 \neq 0\), \(x^2 - 10x - 45 \neq 0\), and \(x^2 - 10x - 69 \neq 0\). We then simplify the equation by clearing the denominators using the fact that the denominators are non-zero. This allows us to rewrite the equation in a form that can be solved using algebraic manipulation and linear arithmetic.
