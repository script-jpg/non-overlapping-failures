  To solve the equation \(\frac{1}{x^2 - 10x - 29} + \frac{1}{x^2 - 10x - 45} - \frac{2}{x^2 - 10x - 69} = 0\), we need to show that the positive solution is \(x = 13\). We start by ensuring that the denominators are non-zero and then proceed with the equation. By simplifying and solving the equation, we find that \(x = 13\) is indeed the solution.
