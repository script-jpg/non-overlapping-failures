  To solve the equation:
  \[
  \frac{1}{x^2 - 10x - 29} + \frac{1}{x^2 - 10x - 45} - \frac{2}{x^2 - 10x - 69} = 0
  \]
  we need to find the positive solution \( x \) that satisfies the equation. By inspection or solving the system of equations, we determine that \( x = 13 \) is the only positive solution that satisfies all the given conditions.
