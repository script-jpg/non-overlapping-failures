  Given the equation \(\frac{1}{x^2 - 10x - 29} + \frac{1}{x^2 - 10x - 45} - \frac{2}{x^2 - 10x - 69} = 0\), we need to find the positive solution. We will show that the solution is \(x = 13\).
  First, we simplify the given equation by clearing the denominators. This involves multiplying both sides by the common denominator \((x^2 - 10x - 29)(x^2 - 10x - 45)(x^2 - 10x - 69)\). After simplifying, we combine like terms and solve for \(x\).
