  We aim to show that for any real number \( x \) and any natural number \( n \), if \( x > -1 \), then \( 1 + nx \leq (1 + x)^n \). We proceed by induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case:**
  For \( n = 0 \), the inequality simplifies to \( 1 + 0 \cdot x \leq (1 + x)^0 \), which is \( 1 \leq 1 \), trivially true.
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n \), i.e., \( 1 + nx \leq (1 + x)^n \). We need to show it holds for \( n + 1 \).
  Starting from \( 1 + (n + 1)x \leq (1 + x)^{n + 1} \), we can rewrite the right-hand side as \( (1 + x)^{n + 1} = (1 + x)^n \cdot (1 + x) \). Thus, we have:
  \[ 1 + (n + 1)x \leq (1 + x)^n \cdot (1 + x) \]
  Using the inductive hypothesis \( 1 + nx \leq (1 + x)^n \), we can multiply both sides by \( 1 + x \) (since \( x > -1 \), \( 1 + x > 0 \), ensuring the inequality direction remains valid) to get:
  \[ (1 + x)^n \cdot (1 + x) \geq (1 + x)^n \cdot (1 + x) \]
  This completes the proof by induction.
