  We aim to show that for any real number \( x \) and any natural number \( n \), if \( x > -1 \), then \( (1 + nx) \leq (1 + x)^n \). We proceed by induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case:**
  For \( n = 1 \), we need to show \( 1 + x \leq (1 + x)^1 \). This simplifies to \( 1 + x \leq 1 + x \), which is trivially true.
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n \), i.e., \( 1 + nx \leq (1 + x)^n \). We need to show it holds for \( n + 1 \).
  Consider \( (1 + x)^{n+1} = (1 + x)^n \cdot (1 + x) \). By the inductive hypothesis, \( 1 + nx \leq (1 + x)^n \), so
  \[ 1 + (n+1)x = 1 + nx + x \leq (1 + x)^n + x \leq (1 + x)^n \cdot (1 + x) = (1 + x)^{n+1} \]
  Thus, the statement holds for \( n + 1 \). By induction, the statement is true for all natural numbers \( n \).
