  We aim to show that for any real number \( x \) and any natural number \( n \), if \( x > -1 \), then \( (1 + nx) \leq (1 + x)^n \). We will use mathematical induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case:**
  For \( n = 1 \), we have:
  \[ 1 + 1 \cdot x = 1 + x \]
  \[ (1 + x)^1 = 1 + x \]
  Clearly, \( 1 + x \leq 1 + x \), so the base case holds.
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n \), i.e., \( 1 + nx \leq (1 + x)^n \). We need to show it holds for \( n + 1 \):
  \[ 1 + (n + 1) \cdot x = 1 + nx + x \]
  \[ (1 + x)^{n+1} = (1 + x)^n \cdot (1 + x) \]
  Using the inductive hypothesis \( 1 + nx \leq (1 + x)^n \), we have:
  \[ 1 + nx + x \leq (1 + x)^n \cdot (1 + x) \]
  Since \( (1 + x)^n \cdot (1 + x) = (1 + x)^{n+1} \), we conclude:
  \[ 1 + (n + 1) \cdot x \leq (1 + x)^{n+1} \]
  Thus, by induction, the statement holds for all natural numbers \( n \).
