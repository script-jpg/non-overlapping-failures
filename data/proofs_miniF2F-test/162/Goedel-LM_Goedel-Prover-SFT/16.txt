  We aim to show that for any real number \( x \) and any natural number \( n \), if \( x > -1 \), then \( (1 + nx) \leq (1 + x)^n \). We proceed by induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case:**
  For \( n = 0 \), the inequality simplifies to \( 1 + 0 \cdot x \leq (1 + x)^0 \), which is \( 1 \leq 1 \), trivially true.
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n \), i.e., \( 1 + nx \leq (1 + x)^n \). We need to show it holds for \( n + 1 \).
  Starting from \( 1 + (n + 1)x \leq (1 + x)^{n + 1} \), we can rewrite the right-hand side as \( (1 + x)^n \cdot (1 + x) \). By the inductive hypothesis, we have:
  \[ 1 + nx \leq (1 + x)^n \]
  Thus, we need to show:
  \[ 1 + nx + (n + 1)x \leq (1 + x)^n \cdot (1 + x) \]
  Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:
  \[ 1 + (n + 1)x + nx \leq (1 + x)^n \cdot (1 + x) \]
  \[ 1 + (n + 1)x + nx \leq (1 + x)^n \cdot (1 + x) \]
  \[ 1 + (n + 1)x + nx \leq (1 + x)^n \cdot (1 + x) \]
  By the inductive hypothesis, we know:
  \[ 1 + nx \leq (1 + x)^n \]
  Thus, we can conclude:
  \[ 1 + (n + 1)x \leq (1 + x)^n \cdot (1 + x) \]
  This completes the inductive step, proving the statement.
