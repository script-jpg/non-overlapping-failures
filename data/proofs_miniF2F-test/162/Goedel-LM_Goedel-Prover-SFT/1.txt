  We aim to show that for any real number \( x \) and any natural number \( n \), if \( x > -1 \), then \( (1 + nx) \leq (1 + x)^n \).
  1. **Base Case**: When \( n = 1 \), we need to show \( 1 + x \leq (1 + x)^1 \). This is trivially true since \( (1 + x)^1 = 1 + x \).
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds for some \( n \), i.e., \( 1 + nx \leq (1 + x)^n \). We need to show it holds for \( n + 1 \).
     - Using the inductive hypothesis, we have \( 1 + (n + 1)x \leq (1 + x)^{n + 1} \).
     - This can be derived by expanding \( (1 + x)^{n + 1} \) and comparing it with \( 1 + (n + 1)x \).
