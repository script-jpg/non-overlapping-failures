  We aim to show that for any real number \( x \) and any natural number \( n \), if \( x > -1 \), then \( (1 + nx) \leq (1 + x)^n \). We proceed by induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case:** When \( n = 1 \), we have \( 1 + x \leq (1 + x)^1 \), which simplifies to \( 1 + x \leq 1 + x \). This is trivially true.
  **Inductive Step:** Assume the statement holds for some \( n \), i.e., \( 1 + nx \leq (1 + x)^n \). We need to show it holds for \( n + 1 \).
  Starting from \( 1 + (n + 1)x \), we can rewrite it as \( 1 + nx + x \). Using the inductive hypothesis, we know \( 1 + nx \leq (1 + x)^n \). Therefore, we have:
  \[ 1 + nx + x \leq (1 + x)^n + x \]
  We need to show \( (1 + x)^n + x \leq (1 + x)^{n + 1} \). Using the binomial theorem, \( (1 + x)^{n + 1} = (1 + x)^n (1 + x) \). Thus, we need to prove:
  \[ (1 + x)^n + x \leq (1 + x)^n (1 + x) \]
  Given \( x > -1 \), we know \( 1 + x > 1 \). Therefore, the inequality holds:
  \[ (1 + x)^n + x \leq (1 + x)^n (1 + x) \]
  By induction, the statement is true for all natural numbers \( n \).
