  We aim to show that for any real number \( x \) and any natural number \( n \), if \( x > -1 \), then \( (1 + nx) \leq (1 + x)^n \).
  1. **Base Case**: When \( n = 0 \), the inequality simplifies to \( 1 + 0 \cdot x \leq (1 + x)^0 \), which is \( 1 \leq 1 \), trivially true.
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds for some \( n \). We need to show it holds for \( n + 1 \).
     - Start with the inequality \( 1 + (n + 1)x \leq (1 + x)^{n + 1} \).
     - Expand \( (1 + x)^{n + 1} \) using the binomial theorem:
       \[
       (1 + x)^{n + 1} = \sum_{k=0}^{n+1} \binom{n+1}{k} x^k
       \]
     - The right-hand side includes terms like \( 1 + (n+1)x + \binom{n+1}{2} x^2 + \cdots \).
     - By the inductive hypothesis, \( 1 + nx \leq (1 + x)^n \).
     - We need to show that \( 1 + (n+1)x \leq \sum_{k=0}^{n+1} \binom{n+1}{k} x^k \).
     - This can be done by considering the non-negativity of the terms and applying basic arithmetic inequalities.
