  We aim to show that for any real number \( x \) and any natural number \( n \), if \( x > -1 \), then \( (1 + nx) \leq (1 + x)^n \). We proceed by induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case:**
  For \( n = 1 \), we need to show \( 1 + x \leq (1 + x) \), which is trivially true.
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for \( n \), i.e., \( 1 + nx \leq (1 + x)^n \). We need to show it holds for \( n + 1 \).
  Starting from \( 1 + (n + 1)x \leq (1 + x)^{n + 1} \), we use the inductive hypothesis:
  \[ 1 + nx \leq (1 + x)^n \]
  Multiplying both sides by \( 1 + x \) (since \( x > -1 \), \( 1 + x > 0 \)), we get:
  \[ (1 + nx)(1 + x) \leq (1 + x)^n (1 + x) \]
  Expanding the left-hand side:
  \[ 1 + x + nx + nx^2 = 1 + (n + 1)x + nx^2 \]
  Since \( nx^2 \geq 0 \) for all \( x \), the inequality holds:
  \[ 1 + (n + 1)x + nx^2 \leq (1 + x)^{n + 1} \]
  Thus, by induction, the statement is true for all natural numbers \( n \).
