  We aim to show that for any real number \( x \) and any natural number \( n \), if \( x > -1 \), then \( (1 + nx) \leq (1 + x)^n \).
  1. **Base Case**: When \( n = 1 \), the inequality simplifies to \( 1 + x \leq 1 + x \), which is trivially true.
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the inequality holds for some \( n \). We need to show it holds for \( n + 1 \).
     - Start with the left-hand side: \( 1 + (n + 1)x \).
     - Rewrite the right-hand side: \( (1 + x)^{n+1} \).
     - Using the inductive hypothesis, we know \( 1 + nx \leq (1 + x)^n \).
     - We need to show \( 1 + (n + 1)x \leq (1 + x)^{n+1} \).
     - Expand \( (1 + x)^{n+1} \) using the binomial theorem: \( (1 + x)^{n+1} = (1 + x)^n \cdot (1 + x) \).
     - By the inductive hypothesis, \( 1 + nx \leq (1 + x)^n \), so \( 1 + (n + 1)x \leq (1 + x)^n \cdot (1 + x) \).
     - This completes the proof.
