  We aim to show that for any real number \( x \) and any natural number \( n \), if \( x > -1 \), then \( (1 + nx) \leq (1 + x)^n \). We will use mathematical induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case:**
  For \( n = 1 \), we have:
  \[ 1 + 1 \cdot x \leq 1 + x \]
  This is trivially true since both sides are equal.
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n = k \), i.e., \( 1 + kx \leq (1 + x)^k \). We need to show it holds for \( n = k + 1 \).
  Starting from the left-hand side:
  \[ 1 + (k + 1)x = 1 + kx + x \]
  Using the inductive hypothesis:
  \[ 1 + kx \leq (1 + x)^k \]
  Thus:
  \[ 1 + kx + x \leq (1 + x)^k + x \]
  We need to show:
  \[ (1 + x)^k + x \leq (1 + x)^{k+1} \]
  By the binomial theorem:
  \[ (1 + x)^{k+1} = (1 + x)^k \cdot (1 + x) \]
  So we need to prove:
  \[ (1 + x)^k + x \leq (1 + x)^k \cdot (1 + x) \]
  Since \( x > -1 \), we can use the fact that \( (1 + x)^k \geq 1 + kx \) for \( k \geq 1 \), which is true because \( x > -1 \) implies \( (1 + x)^k \geq 1 + kx \).
  Thus, the inductive step holds, completing the proof.
