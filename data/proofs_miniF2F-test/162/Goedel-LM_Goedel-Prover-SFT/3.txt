  We aim to show that for any real number \( x \) and any natural number \( n \), if \( x > -1 \), then \( (1 + nx) \leq (1 + x)^n \). We will use mathematical induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case:**
  For \( n = 1 \), the inequality simplifies to \( 1 + x \leq 1 + x \), which is trivially true.
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n = k \), i.e., \( 1 + kx \leq (1 + x)^k \). We need to show it holds for \( n = k + 1 \).
  Starting from \( 1 + (k + 1)x \), we can rewrite it as \( 1 + kx + x \). By the inductive hypothesis, we have:
  \[ 1 + kx \leq (1 + x)^k \]
  Thus,
  \[ 1 + kx + x \leq (1 + x)^k + x \]
  We need to show:
  \[ (1 + x)^k + x \leq (1 + x)^{k+1} \]
  Expanding \( (1 + x)^{k+1} \), we get:
  \[ (1 + x)^{k+1} = (1 + x)^k \cdot (1 + x) \]
  Using the inductive hypothesis:
  \[ (1 + x)^k + x \leq (1 + x)^k \cdot (1 + x) \]
  This completes the inductive step, proving the statement for all \( n \).
