  We aim to show that for any real number \( x \) and any natural number \( n \), if \( x > -1 \), then \( (1 + nx) \leq (1 + x)^n \). We proceed by induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case:**
  For \( n = 1 \), we need to show \( 1 + x \leq 1 + x \), which is trivially true.
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n = k \), i.e., \( 1 + kx \leq (1 + x)^k \). We need to show it holds for \( n = k + 1 \).
  Starting from \( 1 + (k + 1)x \), we can rewrite it as \( 1 + kx + x \). Using the inductive hypothesis, we have:
  \[ 1 + kx + x \leq (1 + x)^k \cdot (1 + x) \]
  Expanding \( (1 + x)^k \cdot (1 + x) \) using the binomial theorem, we get:
  \[ (1 + x)^k \cdot (1 + x) = \sum_{i=0}^{k+1} \binom{k+1}{i} x^i \]
  Since \( 0 \leq x \leq 1 \) (as \( x > -1 \)), each term \( \binom{k+1}{i} x^i \) is non-negative and less than or equal to \( (1 + x)^{k+1} \). Therefore, we have:
  \[ 1 + kx + x \leq (1 + x)^{k+1} \]
  Thus, the statement holds for \( n = k + 1 \). By induction, the statement is true for all natural numbers \( n \).
