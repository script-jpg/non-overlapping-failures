  We aim to show that for any real number \( x \) and any natural number \( n \), if \( x > -1 \), then \( (1 + nx) \leq (1 + x)^n \). We will use mathematical induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case:**
  For \( n = 1 \), the inequality simplifies to \( 1 + x \leq 1 + x \), which is trivially true.
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n \), i.e., \( 1 + nx \leq (1 + x)^n \). We need to show it holds for \( n + 1 \).
  Starting from the left-hand side:
  \[ 1 + (n + 1)x = 1 + nx + x \]
  Using the inductive hypothesis:
  \[ 1 + nx \leq (1 + x)^n \]
  Thus:
  \[ 1 + nx + x \leq (1 + x)^n + x \]
  We need to show:
  \[ (1 + x)^n + x \leq (1 + x)^{n+1} \]
  Using the binomial theorem:
  \[ (1 + x)^{n+1} = (1 + x)^n \cdot (1 + x) \]
  Since \( x > -1 \), we know \( 1 + x > 1 \), so:
  \[ (1 + x)^n \cdot (1 + x) > (1 + x)^n \]
  Therefore:
  \[ (1 + x)^n + x \leq (1 + x)^n \cdot (1 + x) \]
  This completes the inductive step, proving the inequality for all \( n \).
