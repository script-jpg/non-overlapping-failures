    -- The reference answer seems to have an inaccuracy here, as written it would lead to a complete fallacy
    -- We should apply the inductive hypothesis to the first factor and multiply by $(1+x)$
    -- The reference answer corrected it later, but let's not digress too much
    -- At this point, we should apply the inductive hypothesis and multiply both sides by $(1+x)$
    have hyp : 1 + ↑(k + 1) * x ≤ (1 + x) ^ (k + 1) := hk (by linarith) h
