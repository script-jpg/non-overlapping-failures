-- According to the reference answer, we need to prove a more general form of induction
  have moreGeneralInduction {P : ℕ → Prop} (h₀ : P 0) (h₁ : ∀ n, P n → P n + 1) : ∀ n, P n := by
    intro n
    induction n using Nat.strong_induction_on with
    | h n ih =>
      specialize h₁ n ih
      exact h₁

  -- Now we prove the form of induction given in the reference answer
  have h₀ : ∀ n : ℕ, (1 + ↑n * x) ≤ (1 + x) ^ (n : ℕ) := by
    intro n
    induction n with
    | zero =>
      simp
    | succ n ih =>
      -- Apply the induction hypothesis
      specialize ih (by linarith)
      specialize moreGeneralInduction h₀ h₁
      specialize moreGeneralInduction (1 + ↑n * x) x
      -- Combine the two inequalities
      rw [Nat.add_one, Nat.cast_add] at this
