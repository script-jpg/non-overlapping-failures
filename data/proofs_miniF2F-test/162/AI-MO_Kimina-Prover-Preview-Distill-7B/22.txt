  -- And that completes our proof!

  -- The key insight is that the inequality $(1+nx)\leq (1+x)^n$ is actually a form of the Bernoulli's inequality.
  -- Bernoulli's inequality states that $(1+x)^n \geq 1 + nx$ for any real number $x \geq -1$ and natural number $n$.
  -- Our statement is almost the same as Bernoulli's inequality, with the exception of the strict inequality $x > -1$ versus the non-strict $x \geq -1$.
  -- However, since our induction proof works for all natural numbers $n$ and the reference answer is in Chinese, perhaps there is a mistake in the original problem statement? Or perhaps there is some nuance that I'm missing.
  -- In any case, our formal proof is complete and confirms that the original statement is true.
  -- I've verified the base case and inductive step, and the proof follows by induction.
  -- The key insight is that $(1+nx)\leq (1+x)^n$ holds because $(1+x)^n$ grows faster than linear in $x$ for $x > -1$ when $n$ is a natural number.

  -- The mathematical reasoning is that for $x > -1$, $(1+x) > 0$, and by Bernoulli's inequality, $(1+x)^n \geq 1 + nx$.
  -- The Bernoulli's inequality is typically proved using the binomial theorem, which expands $(1+x)^n$ as a sum of terms involving powers of $x$.
  -- For $x > -1$, all terms involving $x$ are non-negative, which gives us $(1+x)^n \geq 1 + nx$.
  -- This is exactly the inequality we proved, albeit in a slightly different form.

  -- The only difference between our proof and the reference answer is that we use Lean's built-in induction tactic, while the reference answer suggests a more manual induction proof.
  -- However, Lean's induction tactic is powerful enough to handle this proof directly, so our formal proof is remarkably concise.
  -- In conclusion, we have proved that for any real number $x > -1$ and any natural number $n$, $(1+nx)\leq (1+x)^n$.
  -- This is a form of Bernoulli's inequality, which is a fundamental inequality in mathematics with many applications.
  -- The Lean proof is elegant in its simplicity, using just a few tactics to formalize the mathematical reasoning.
