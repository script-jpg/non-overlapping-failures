  Given a rectangular patio with an area of 180 square feet and a perimeter of 54 feet, we need to show that the length of the diagonal (in feet) squared is 369.
  1. From the area equation \( a \times b = 180 \), we can express \( b \) in terms of \( a \) as \( b = \frac{180}{a} \).
  2. Substitute \( b = \frac{180}{a} \) into the perimeter equation \( 2(a + b) = 54 \):
     \[
     2 \left( a + \frac{180}{a} \right) = 54
     \]
  3. Simplify the equation:
     \[
     a + \frac{180}{a} = 27
     \]
  4. Multiply through by \( a \) to clear the fraction:
     \[
     a^2 + 180 = 27a
     \]
  5. Rearrange to form a quadratic equation:
     \[
     a^2 - 27a + 180 = 0
     \]
  6. Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( a = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \):
     \[
     a = \frac{27 \pm \sqrt{27^2 - 4 \times 1 \times 180}}{2 \times 1}
     \]
     \[
     a = \frac{27 \pm \sqrt{729 - 720}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     a = \frac{27 \pm \sqrt{9}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     a = \frac{27 \pm 3}{2}
     \]
  7. This gives two solutions:
     \[
     a = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \quad \text{and} \quad a = \frac{24}{2} = 12
     \]
  8. For each value of \( a \), find \( b \):
     \[
     b = \frac{180}{15} = 12 \quad \text{and} \quad b = \frac{180}{12} = 15
     \]
  9. Calculate \( a^2 + b^2 \) for each pair \((a, b)\):
     \[
     15^2 + 12^2 = 225 + 144 = 369
     \]
  Thus, the length of the diagonal squared is indeed 369.
