  Given a rectangular patio with an area of 180 square feet and a perimeter of 54 feet, we need to find the length of the diagonal in feet and show that it is 369. We start by using the given equations for the area and perimeter to solve for the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\).
  1. From the area equation \(a \cdot b = 180\), we can express \(b\) in terms of \(a\) as \(b = \frac{180}{a}\).
  2. Substitute \(b = \frac{180}{a}\) into the perimeter equation \(2(a + b) = 54\):
     \[
     2\left(a + \frac{180}{a}\right) = 54
     \]
  3. Simplify the equation:
     \[
     2\left(\frac{a^2 + 180}{a}\right) = 54
     \]
     \[
     \frac{2(a^2 + 180)}{a} = 54
     \]
     \[
     2(a^2 + 180) = 54a
     \]
     \[
     2a^2 + 360 = 54a
     \]
  4. Rearrange to form a quadratic equation:
     \[
     2a^2 - 54a + 360 = 0
     \]
  5. Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(a = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\):
     \[
     a = \frac{54 \pm \sqrt{54^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot 360}}{2 \cdot 2}
     \]
     \[
     a = \frac{54 \pm \sqrt{2916 - 2880}}{4}
     \]
     \[
     a = \frac{54 \pm \sqrt{36}}{4}
     \]
     \[
     a = \frac{54 \pm 6}{4}
     \]
     \[
     a = 15 \quad \text{or} \quad a = 12
     \]
  Since \(b = \frac{180}{a}\), we find the corresponding \(b\) values:
  - For \(a = 15\), \(b = \frac{180}{15} = 12\)
  - For \(a = 12\), \(b = \frac{180}{12} = 15\)
  Thus, the dimensions are \(15 \times 12\) or \(12 \times 15\). The diagonal of a rectangle is given by \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\). We calculate the diagonal squared:
  - For \(a = 15\) and \(b = 12\), the diagonal squared is \(15^2 + 12^2 = 225 + 144 = 369\).
  - For \(a = 12\) and \(b = 15\), the diagonal squared is \(12^2 + 15^2 = 144 + 225 = 369\).
  Thus, the length of the diagonal squared is 369.
