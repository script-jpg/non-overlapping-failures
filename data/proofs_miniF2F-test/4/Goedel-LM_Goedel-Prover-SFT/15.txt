  Given a rectangular patio with an area of 180 square feet and a perimeter of 54 feet, we need to find the length of the diagonal squared. We start by using the given equations:
  1. \( a \times b = 180 \)
  2. \( 2(a + b) = 54 \)
  First, we simplify the perimeter equation:
  \[ a + b = 27 \]
  Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to express the diagonal squared:
  \[ a^2 + b^2 \]
  We know that:
  \[ a^2 + b^2 = (a + b)^2 - 2ab \]
  Substituting the known values:
  \[ a^2 + b^2 = 27^2 - 2 \times 180 \]
  \[ a^2 + b^2 = 729 - 360 \]
  \[ a^2 + b^2 = 369 \]
  Thus, the length of the diagonal squared is 369.

  -- Simplify the perimeter equation to find the sum of the sides
  have a_plus_b : a + b = 27 := by linarith [h₂]
  -- Use the Pythagorean theorem to express the diagonal squared
  have a_sq_plus_b_sq : a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 = (a + b) ^ 2 - 2 * (a * b) := by ring
  -- Substitute the known values into the equation
  rw [a_plus_b, h₁] at a_sq_plus_b_sq
  -- Calculate the result to confirm the length of the diagonal squared
