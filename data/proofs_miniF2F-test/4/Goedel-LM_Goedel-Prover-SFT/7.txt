  Given a rectangular patio with an area of 180 square feet and a perimeter of 54 feet, we need to show that the length of the diagonal is 369 feet. We start by using the given conditions to find the lengths of the sides \(a\) and \(b\).
  1. From the area condition \(a \cdot b = 180\), we can express \(b\) in terms of \(a\) as \(b = \frac{180}{a}\).
  2. Substitute \(b = \frac{180}{a}\) into the perimeter condition \(2(a + b) = 54\):
     \[
     2 \left(a + \frac{180}{a}\right) = 54
     \]
  3. Simplify the equation:
     \[
     a + \frac{180}{a} = 27
     \]
  4. Multiply both sides by \(a\) to clear the fraction:
     \[
     a^2 + 180 = 27a
     \]
  5. Rearrange to form a quadratic equation:
     \[
     a^2 - 27a + 180 = 0
     \]
  6. Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(a = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\):
     \[
     a = \frac{27 \pm \sqrt{27^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 180}}{2 \cdot 1}
     \]
     \[
     a = \frac{27 \pm \sqrt{729 - 720}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     a = \frac{27 \pm 3}{2}
     \]
     \[
     a = 15 \quad \text{or} \quad a = 12
     \]
  7. Since \(a\) and \(b\) are interchangeable, we can assume \(a = 12\) and \(b = 15\).
  8. Now, calculate the diagonal squared:
     \[
     a^2 + b^2 = 12^2 + 15^2 = 144 + 225 = 369
     \]
  Thus, the length of the diagonal squared is indeed 369.
