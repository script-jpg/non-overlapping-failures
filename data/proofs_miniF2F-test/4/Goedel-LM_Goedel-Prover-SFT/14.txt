  Given a rectangular patio with an area of 180 square feet and a perimeter of 54 feet, we need to show that the length of the diagonal (in feet) squared is 369. We start by using the given conditions to find the dimensions of the rectangle.
  1. From the area condition \(a \cdot b = 180\), we can express \(b\) as \(b = \frac{180}{a}\).
  2. Substitute \(b = \frac{180}{a}\) into the perimeter condition \(2(a + b) = 54\):
     \[
     2(a + \frac{180}{a}) = 54
     \]
  3. Simplify the equation:
     \[
     2a + \frac{360}{a} = 54
     \]
  4. Multiply through by \(a\) to clear the fraction:
     \[
     2a^2 + 360 = 54a
     \]
  5. Rearrange to form a quadratic equation:
     \[
     2a^2 - 54a + 360 = 0
     \]
  6. Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(a = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\):
     \[
     a = \frac{54 \pm \sqrt{54^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot 360}}{4}
     \]
     \[
     a = \frac{54 \pm \sqrt{2916 - 2880}}{4}
     \]
     \[
     a = \frac{54 \pm \sqrt{36}}{4}
     \]
     \[
     a = \frac{54 \pm 6}{4}
     \]
     \[
     a = 15 \text{ or } a = 12
     \]
  7. If \(a = 15\), then \(b = \frac{180}{15} = 12\). If \(a = 12\), then \(b = \frac{180}{12} = 15\).
  8. In both cases, the dimensions are \(a = 15\) and \(b = 12\).
  9. Calculate the diagonal squared:
     \[
     a^2 + b^2 = 15^2 + 12^2 = 225 + 144 = 369
     \]
