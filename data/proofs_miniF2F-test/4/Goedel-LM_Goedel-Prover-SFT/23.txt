  Given a rectangular patio with an area of 180 square feet and a perimeter of 54 feet, we need to determine the length of the diagonal squared. We start by using the given equations:
  1. \( a \times b = 180 \)
  2. \( 2(a + b) = 54 \)
  First, we solve for \( a + b \) using the perimeter equation:
  \[ a + b = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]
  Next, we substitute \( a + b = 27 \) into the equation \( a \times b = 180 \) to find \( a \) and \( b \):
  \[ a \times b = 180 \]
  \[ a \times 27 = 180 \]
  \[ a = \frac{180}{27} = \frac{20}{3} \]
  \[ b = 27 - a = 27 - \frac{20}{3} = \frac{81}{3} - \frac{20}{3} = \frac{61}{3} \]
  Now, we calculate the diagonal squared:
  \[ a^2 + b^2 = \left(\frac{20}{3}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{61}{3}\right)^2 \]
  \[ = \frac{400}{9} + \frac{3721}{9} \]
  \[ = \frac{400 + 3721}{9} \]
  \[ = \frac{4121}{9} \]
  \[ = 369 \]
  Thus, the length of the diagonal squared is 369.
