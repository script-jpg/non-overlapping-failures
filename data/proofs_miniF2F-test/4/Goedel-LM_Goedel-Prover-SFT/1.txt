  Given a rectangular patio with an area of 180 square feet and a perimeter of 54 feet, we need to show that the length of the diagonal (in feet) squared is 369. We start by using the given conditions to find the values of \(a\) and \(b\).
  1. From the area condition \(a \cdot b = 180\), we can express \(b\) in terms of \(a\) as \(b = \frac{180}{a}\).
  2. Substituting \(b = \frac{180}{a}\) into the perimeter condition \(2(a + b) = 54\), we get \(2(a + \frac{180}{a}) = 54\).
  3. Simplifying the equation \(2(a + \frac{180}{a}) = 54\), we obtain \(a + \frac{180}{a} = 27\).
  4. Multiplying both sides by \(a\) to clear the fraction, we get \(a^2 + 180 = 27a\).
  5. Rearranging the equation, we have \(a^2 - 27a + 180 = 0\).
  6. Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(a = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -27\), and \(c = 180\), we get \(a = 12\) or \(a = 15\).
  7. If \(a = 12\), then \(b = \frac{180}{12} = 15\). If \(a = 15\), then \(b = \frac{180}{15} = 12\).
  8. In both cases, the diagonal squared is \(a^2 + b^2 = 12^2 + 15^2 = 144 + 225 = 369\).
  Thus, the length of the diagonal squared is indeed 369.
