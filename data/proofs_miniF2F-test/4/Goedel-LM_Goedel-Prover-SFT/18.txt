  Given a rectangular patio with an area of 180 square feet and a perimeter of 54 feet, we need to show that the length of the diagonal (in feet) squared is 369. We start by using the given conditions to find the values of \(a\) and \(b\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are the dimensions of the patio.
  1. From the area condition \(a \cdot b = 180\), we can express \(b\) in terms of \(a\) as \(b = \frac{180}{a}\).
  2. Substitute \(b = \frac{180}{a}\) into the perimeter condition \(2(a + b) = 54\):
     \[
     2 \left(a + \frac{180}{a}\right) = 54
     \]
  3. Simplify the equation:
     \[
     2 \left(a + \frac{180}{a}\right) = 54 \implies a + \frac{180}{a} = 27
     \]
  4. Multiply both sides by \(a\) to clear the fraction:
     \[
     a^2 + 180 = 27a \implies a^2 - 27a + 180 = 0
     \]
  5. Solve the quadratic equation \(a^2 - 27a + 180 = 0\) using the quadratic formula \(a = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\):
     \[
     a = \frac{27 \pm \sqrt{27^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 180}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{27 \pm \sqrt{729 - 720}}{2} = \frac{27 \pm \sqrt{9}}{2} = \frac{27 \pm 3}{2}
     \]
     This gives us two solutions:
     \[
     a = \frac{27 + 3}{2} = 15 \quad \text{and} \quad a = \frac{27 - 3}{2} = 12
     \]
  6. For each \(a\), find \(b\):
     - If \(a = 15\), then \(b = \frac{180}{15} = 12\).
     - If \(a = 12\), then \(b = \frac{180}{12} = 15\).
  7. Calculate the diagonal squared for both pairs \((a, b)\):
     - If \(a = 15\) and \(b = 12\), the diagonal squared is \(15^2 + 12^2 = 225 + 144 = 369\).
     - If \(a = 12\) and \(b = 15\), the diagonal squared is \(12^2 + 15^2 = 144 + 225 = 369\).
  Thus, the length of the diagonal squared is indeed 369.
