  Given a rectangular patio with an area of 180 square feet and a perimeter of 54 feet, we need to find the length of the diagonal (in feet) squared, which is 369.
  1. From the perimeter condition, we derive that the sum of the lengths of the sides is 27 feet.
  2. We then use the Pythagorean theorem to express the diagonal \( d \) in terms of the side lengths \( a \) and \( b \).
  3. Substituting the known values of the area and the perimeter into the derived equations, we solve for the diagonal squared.
