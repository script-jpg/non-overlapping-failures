  Given a rectangular patio with an area of 180 square feet and a perimeter of 54 feet, we need to show that the length of the diagonal (in feet) squared is 369.
  1. From the perimeter condition \(2(a + b) = 54\), we derive \(a + b = 27\).
  2. We use the identity \((a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab\) to express \(a^2 + b^2\) in terms of \(a + b\) and \(ab\).
  3. Substituting \(a + b = 27\) and \(ab = 180\) into the identity, we get \(27^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2 \cdot 180\).
  4. Simplifying this equation, we find \(a^2 + b^2 = 369\).

  -- From the perimeter condition, derive a + b = 27
  have a_plus_b_eq_27 : a + b = 27 := by
    linarith [h₂]
  -- Use the identity (a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab to express a^2 + b^2
  have a_sq_plus_b_sq_eq_369 : a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 = 369 := by
    -- Substitute a + b = 27 and ab = 180 into the identity
    nlinarith [sq_nonneg (a - b)]
  -- The final result is a^2 + b^2 = 369
