  Given a rectangular patio with an area of 180 square feet and a perimeter of 54 feet, we need to find the length of the diagonal (in feet) squared and show that it equals 369.
  1. From the perimeter condition, we derive the sum of the sides:
     \[
     a + b = 27
     \]
  2. We also know the product of the sides from the area condition:
     \[
     a \cdot b = 180
     \]
  3. To find the diagonal squared, we use the identity:
     \[
     (a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab
     \]
  4. Substituting the known values:
     \[
     27^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2 \cdot 180
     \]
  5. Simplifying the equation:
     \[
     729 = a^2 + b^2 + 360
     \]
  6. Solving for \(a^2 + b^2\):
     \[
     a^2 + b^2 = 729 - 360 = 369
     \]

  -- From the perimeter condition, derive the sum of the sides
  have h₃ : a + b = 27 := by linarith
  -- We know the product of the sides from the area condition
  have h₄ : a * b = 180 := by linarith
  -- To find the diagonal squared, use the identity (a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab
  have h₅ : a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 = 369 := by
    -- Substitute the known values into the identity
    nlinarith
  -- The final result is a^2 + b^2 = 369
