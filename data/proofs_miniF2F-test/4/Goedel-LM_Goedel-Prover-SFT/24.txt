  Given a rectangular patio with an area of 180 square feet and a perimeter of 54 feet, we need to find the length of the diagonal (in feet) squared, which is 369.
  1. From the area condition \( a \times b = 180 \), we can express \( b \) in terms of \( a \):
     \[
     b = \frac{180}{a}
     \]
  2. Substitute \( b = \frac{180}{a} \) into the perimeter condition \( 2(a + b) = 54 \):
     \[
     2 \left( a + \frac{180}{a} \right) = 54
     \]
  3. Simplify the equation:
     \[
     2 \left( \frac{a^2 + 180}{a} \right) = 54 \implies 2(a^2 + 180) = 54a \implies 2a^2 + 360 = 54a \implies 2a^2 - 54a + 360 = 0
     \]
  4. Solve the quadratic equation \( 2a^2 - 54a + 360 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula \( a = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \):
     \[
     a = \frac{54 \pm \sqrt{(-54)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times 360}}{2 \times 2} = \frac{54 \pm \sqrt{2916 - 2880}}{4} = \frac{54 \pm \sqrt{36}}{4} = \frac{54 \pm 6}{4}
     \]
     \[
     a = 15 \quad \text{or} \quad a = 12
     \]
  5. For \( a = 15 \):
     \[
     b = \frac{180}{15} = 12
     \]
  6. For \( a = 12 \):
     \[
     b = \frac{180}{12} = 15
     \]
  7. In both cases, the Pythagorean theorem holds:
     \[
     a^2 + b^2 = 15^2 + 12^2 = 225 + 144 = 369
     \]
