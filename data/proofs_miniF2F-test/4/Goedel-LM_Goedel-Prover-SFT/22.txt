  Given a rectangular patio with an area of 180 square feet and a perimeter of 54 feet, we need to show that the length of the diagonal squared is 369. We start by using the given equations to find the values of \(a\) and \(b\).
  1. From the area equation \(a \cdot b = 180\), we can express \(b\) in terms of \(a\):
     \[
     b = \frac{180}{a}
     \]
  2. Substitute \(b\) into the perimeter equation \(2(a + b) = 54\):
     \[
     2 \left(a + \frac{180}{a}\right) = 54
     \]
  3. Simplify the equation:
     \[
     2a + \frac{360}{a} = 54
     \]
  4. Multiply both sides by \(a\) to clear the fraction:
     \[
     2a^2 + 360 = 54a
     \]
  5. Rearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic equation:
     \[
     2a^2 - 54a + 360 = 0
     \]
  6. Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(a = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\):
     \[
     a = \frac{54 \pm \sqrt{54^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot 360}}{2 \cdot 2}
     \]
     \[
     a = \frac{54 \pm \sqrt{2916 - 2880}}{4}
     \]
     \[
     a = \frac{54 \pm \sqrt{36}}{4}
     \]
     \[
     a = \frac{54 \pm 6}{4}
     \]
     \[
     a = \frac{60}{4} \text{ or } a = \frac{48}{4}
     \]
     \[
     a = 15 \text{ or } a = 12
     \]
  7. For each value of \(a\), find the corresponding \(b\):
     \[
     \text{If } a = 15, \text{ then } b = \frac{180}{15} = 12
     \]
     \[
     \text{If } a = 12, \text{ then } b = \frac{180}{12} = 15
     \]
  8. Calculate the diagonal squared:
     \[
     a^2 + b^2 = 15^2 + 12^2 = 225 + 144 = 369
     \]
