-- We have a system of equations: a * b = 180 and 2 * (a + b) = 54.
  -- We want to find a^2 + b^2.
  -- Let's think about how to approach this algebraically first, then translate to Lean 4.

  -- From the second equation, we have a + b = 27.
  have h3 : a + b = 27 := by
    linarith

  -- Now, we want to find a^2 + b^2. We can use the identity:
  -- a^2 + b^2 = (a + b)^2 - 2ab
  -- We have a + b = 27 and ab = 180
  have h4 : a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 = (a + b) ^ 2 - 2 * (a * b) := by

  -- Substitute the values we have:
