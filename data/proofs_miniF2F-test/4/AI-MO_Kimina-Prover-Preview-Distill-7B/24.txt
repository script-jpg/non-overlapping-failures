-- We have a system of equations: xy = 180 and x + y = 27. We want to find x² + y².

  -- Rewrite x² + y² as (x + y)² - 2xy.
  have : a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 = (a + b) ^ 2 - 2 * (a * b) := by ring

  -- Substitute xy = 180 and x + y = 27 into the equation.
  rw [this, h₁, h₂]

  -- Simplify (27)² - 2 * 180 = 729 - 360 = 369.
