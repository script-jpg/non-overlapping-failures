-- We have a system of equations: xy = 180 and x + y = 27. We need to find x² + y².

  -- The answer is 27² - 2·180 = 729 - 360 = 369

  have h : a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 = (27 : ℝ) ^ 2 - 2 * 180 := by

    calc

      a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 = (a + b) ^ 2 - 2 * (a * b) := by ring

      _ = 27 ^ 2 - 2 * 180 := by rw [h₂, h₁]

  norm_num at h

  exact h
