-- We have a system of equations: xy = 180 and x + y = 27. We want to find x² + y².
  -- We know that x² + y² = (x + y)² - 2xy, so we can substitute the values from the equations.
  calc a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 = (a + b) ^ 2 - 2 * (a * b) := by ring
                  _ = 27 ^ 2 - 2 * 180 := by rw [←h₂, ←h₁]
                  _ = 369 := by norm_num

  -- We've proven that the length of the diagonal squared is 369. This matches the expected answer.
