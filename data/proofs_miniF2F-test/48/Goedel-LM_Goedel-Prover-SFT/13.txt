  Given that \( m \) and \( n \) are positive real numbers such that \( m^3 = 2 \) and \( n^3 = 4 \), and the equation \( a + bm + cn = 0 \) for rational numbers \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), we need to show that \( a = b = c = 0 \).
  1. **Normalization and Simplification**: We start by normalizing the given equation \( a + bm + cn = 0 \).
  2. **Non-linear Arithmetic**: Using non-linear arithmetic, we derive that \( a = 0 \), \( b = 0 \), and \( c = 0 \) by considering the non-negativity of the squares of \( m \) and \( n \) and the given values of their cubes.
