  Given that \( m \) and \( n \) are both positive real numbers, \( m^3 = 2 \), \( n^3 = 4 \), and \( a + bm + cn = 0 \) for rational numbers \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), we need to show that \( a = b = c = 0 \).
  1. Start by noting that \( m^3 = 2 \) and \( n^3 = 4 \).
  2. Since \( a + bm + cn = 0 \), we can rearrange it to \( a = -bm - cn \).
  3. To show \( a = 0 \), consider the equation \( a = -bm - cn \). For \( a \) to be zero, \( -bm - cn \) must be zero.
  4. Since \( m \) and \( n \) are positive and their cubes are 2 and 4 respectively, the only solution for \( a \) to be zero is if \( a \) is zero.
  5. Similarly, for \( b \) and \( c \), the only way for their products to be zero is if \( b \) and \( c \) are zero.
  Thus, \( a = 0 \), \( b = 0 \), and \( c = 0 \).
