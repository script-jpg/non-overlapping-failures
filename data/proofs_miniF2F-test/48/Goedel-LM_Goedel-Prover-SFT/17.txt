  Given that \( m \) and \( n \) are both positive real numbers, \( m^3 = 2 \), \( n^3 = 4 \), and \( a + bm + cn = 0 \) for rational numbers \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), we need to show that \( a = b = c = 0 \).
  1. Start by considering the equation \( a + bm + cn = 0 \).
  2. Since \( m \) and \( n \) are positive and their cubes are 2 and 4 respectively, we can use the properties of rational numbers and the given equations to derive the necessary conditions for \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).
  3. Use the fact that \( m \) and \( n \) are positive and their cubes are 2 and 4 to infer that \( m \) and \( n \) must be specific values.
  4. Substitute these values into the equation \( a + bm + cn = 0 \) and use the properties of rational numbers to show that \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) must be zero.
