  Given that \( m \) and \( n \) are positive real numbers, \( m^3 = 2 \), \( n^3 = 4 \), and \( a + bm + cn = 0 \) for rational numbers \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), we need to show that \( a = b = c = 0 \).
  1. **Non-negativity of Squares**: Since \( m \) and \( n \) are positive, their squares \( m^2 \) and \( n^2 \) are also positive.
  2. **Non-negativity of Products**: The product of any real numbers \( b \) and \( c \) is non-negative if both \( b \) and \( c \) are non-negative or both are non-positive.
  3. **Rational Equation**: Using the given equation \( a + bm + cn = 0 \), we can express \( a \) in terms of \( b \) and \( c \):
     \[
     a = -bm - cn
     \]
  4. **Non-negativity of \( a \)**: Since \( m \) and \( n \) are positive, the term \( -bm - cn \) must be non-negative for \( a \) to be non-negative.
  5. **Non-negativity of \( b \) and \( c \)**: If \( b \) and \( c \) are non-negative, then \( -bm - cn \) is non-negative, implying \( a \) is non-negative.
  6. **Conclusion**: By the non-negativity of squares and the given equation, we conclude that \( a = b = c = 0 \).
