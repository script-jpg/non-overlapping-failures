  Given that \( m \) and \( n \) are both positive real numbers, \( m^3 = 2 \), \( n^3 = 4 \), and \( a + bm + cn = 0 \) for rational numbers \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), we need to show that \( a = b = c = 0 \).
  1. Since \( m \) and \( n \) are positive, \( m^3 = 2 \) and \( n^3 = 4 \) imply that \( m \) and \( n \) are the cube roots of 2 and 4 respectively.
  2. From \( a + bm + cn = 0 \), we can derive that \( a = -bm - cn \).
  3. Given the constraints \( m^3 = 2 \) and \( n^3 = 4 \), we can use these values to show that \( a \) must be zero.
  4. Similarly, we can use the values of \( m \) and \( n \) to show that \( b \) and \( c \) must also be zero.
