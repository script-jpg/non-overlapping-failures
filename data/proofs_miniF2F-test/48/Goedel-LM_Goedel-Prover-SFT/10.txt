  Given that \( m \) and \( n \) are both positive real numbers, \( m^3 = 2 \), \( n^3 = 4 \), and \( a + bm + cn = 0 \) for rational numbers \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), we need to show that \( a = b = c = 0 \).
  1. Start by noting that the equation \( a + bm + cn = 0 \) implies \( a = -bm - cn \).
  2. Since \( m \) and \( n \) are positive, \( m^3 = 2 \) and \( n^3 = 4 \).
  3. Substitute \( a = -bm - cn \) into the equation \( a + bm + cn = 0 \).
  4. Simplify the resulting equation to show that \( a = 0 \).
  5. Use the fact that \( m^3 = 2 \) and \( n^3 = 4 \) to derive \( b = 0 \) and \( c = 0 \).

  -- We will show that a = 0, b = 0, and c = 0 by considering the given equations and properties of powers.

  -- First, show that a = 0.
  -- Since m and n are positive and m^3 = 2, n^3 = 4, we can use the fact that a + bm + cn = 0.
  -- By rearranging the equation, we get a = -bm - cn.
  -- Since m and n are positive, we can use the properties of powers and the fact that the cube root of 2 and 4 are irrational to conclude that a must be 0.
