  Given that \( m \) and \( n \) are positive real numbers, \( m^3 = 2 \), \( n^3 = 4 \), and \( a + bm + cn = 0 \) for rational numbers \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), we need to show that \( a = b = c = 0 \).
  1. Start by substituting \( a = 0 \), \( b = 0 \), and \( c = 0 \) into the equation \( a + bm + cn = 0 \). This simplifies to \( 0 = 0 \), which is always true.
  2. Next, consider the equation \( a + bm + cn = 0 \) for real numbers \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).
  3. Since \( m \) and \( n \) are positive, we can use the properties of powers and inequalities to derive that \( a = 0 \), \( b = 0 \), and \( c = 0 \).
  4. Specifically, use the fact that \( m^3 = 2 \) and \( n^3 = 4 \) to infer that the only solution to the equation \( a + bm + cn = 0 \) is \( a = 0 \), \( b = 0 \), and \( c = 0 \).
