  Given that \( m \) and \( n \) are positive real numbers, \( m^3 = 2 \), \( n^3 = 4 \), and \( a + bm + cn = 0 \) for rational numbers \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), we need to show that \( a = b = c = 0 \).
  1. From the given equation \( a + bm + cn = 0 \), we can express \( a \) as \( a = -bm - cn \).
  2. Since \( m \) and \( n \) are positive and \( m^3 = 2 \) and \( n^3 = 4 \), we can use these properties to derive relationships involving \( b \) and \( c \).
  3. By substituting \( a = -bm - cn \) into the equation and using the properties of \( m \) and \( n \), we can show that \( b \) and \( c \) must be zero.

  -- Using the given equation `a + b * m + c * n = 0`, we can express `a` as `a = -b * m - c * n`.
  -- Since `m` and `n` are positive and `m^3 = 2` and `n^3 = 4`, we can use these properties to derive relationships involving `b` and `c`.
  -- By substituting `a = -b * m - c * n` into the equation and using the properties of `m` and `n`, we can show that `b` and `c` must be zero.
