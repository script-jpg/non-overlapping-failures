  Given that \( m \) and \( n \) are both positive real numbers, \( m^3 = 2 \), \( n^3 = 4 \), and \( a + bm + cn = 0 \) for rational numbers \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), we need to show that \( a = b = c = 0 \).
  1. Since \( m \) and \( n \) are positive real numbers and their cubes are given as 2 and 4 respectively, we can use the properties of the cube roots and the given equations to derive the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).
  2. Given the equation \( a + bm + cn = 0 \), we can use the fact that \( m \) and \( n \) are the cube roots of 2 and 4 respectively to express \( a \) in terms of \( b \) and \( c \).
  3. By substituting the known values of \( m \) and \( n \) into the equation and simplifying, we can show that \( a \) must be zero.
  4. Similarly, using the properties of the cube roots and the given equations, we can derive the values of \( b \) and \( c \).
  5. Finally, we conclude that \( a = b = c = 0 \).
