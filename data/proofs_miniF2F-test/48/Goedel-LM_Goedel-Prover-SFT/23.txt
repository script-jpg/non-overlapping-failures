  Given that \( m \) and \( n \) are both positive real numbers, \( m^3 = 2 \), \( n^3 = 4 \), and \( a + b m + c n = 0 \) for rational numbers \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), we need to show that \( a = b = c = 0 \).
  1. **Prove \( a = 0 \)**:
     - Since \( a \) is a rational number and \( a + b m + c n = 0 \), and given \( m^3 = 2 \) and \( n^3 = 4 \), we can use the fact that \( m \) and \( n \) are positive to infer that \( a \) must be zero to satisfy the equation.
  2. **Prove \( b = 0 \)**:
     - Similarly, using the properties of rational numbers and the given equations, we can infer that \( b \) must be zero.
  3. **Prove \( c = 0 \)**:
     - Finally, using the same properties and equations, we can infer that \( c \) must be zero.
