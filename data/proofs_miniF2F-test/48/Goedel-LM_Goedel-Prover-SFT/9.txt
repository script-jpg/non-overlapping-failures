  Given that \( m \) and \( n \) are both positive real numbers, \( m^3 = 2 \), \( n^3 = 4 \), and \( a + bm + cn = 0 \) for rational numbers \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), we need to show that \( a = b = c = 0 \).
  1. Start by rewriting the equation \( a + bm + cn = 0 \) to \( a = -bm - cn \).
  2. Normalize the numerical values \( m^3 = 2 \) and \( n^3 = 4 \).
  3. Use the fact that \( m \) and \( n \) are positive to infer that \( m \) and \( n \) must be such that the equation \( a = -bm - cn \) holds true.
  4. Apply algebraic manipulations and inequalities to show that \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) must be zero.
