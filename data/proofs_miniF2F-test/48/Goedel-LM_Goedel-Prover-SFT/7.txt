  Given that \( m \) and \( n \) are positive real numbers, \( m^3 = 2 \), \( n^3 = 4 \), and \( a + bm + cn = 0 \) for rational numbers \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), we need to show that \( a = 0 \), \( b = 0 \), and \( c = 0 \).
  First, we use the fact that \( m^3 = 2 \) and \( n^3 = 4 \) to infer that \( m \) and \( n \) are the cube roots of 2 and 4, respectively. Since 2 and 4 are perfect cubes, we can express \( m \) and \( n \) as \( m = \sqrt[3]{2} \) and \( n = \sqrt[3]{4} \).
  Next, we substitute these values into the equation \( a + bm + cn = 0 \). We know that \( m \) and \( n \) are irrational numbers, and since \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are rational, the only way for the sum to be zero is if each term individually is zero. Therefore, \( a = 0 \), \( b = 0 \), and \( c = 0 \).
