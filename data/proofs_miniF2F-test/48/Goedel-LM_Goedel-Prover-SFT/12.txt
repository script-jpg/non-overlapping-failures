  Given that \( m \) and \( n \) are positive real numbers, \( m^3 = 2 \), \( n^3 = 4 \), and \( a + bm + cn = 0 \) for rational numbers \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), we need to show that \( a = b = c = 0 \).
  1. Since \( m \) and \( n \) are positive, we can use the properties of cubes and the given equations to derive the required result.
  2. We know \( m^3 = 2 \) and \( n^3 = 4 \).
  3. We need to show that \( a = 0 \), \( b = 0 \), and \( c = 0 \).
  4. Using the given equation \( a + bm + cn = 0 \), we can substitute and simplify using the properties of the cube roots and the given values.
  5. By applying algebraic manipulations and the properties of the cube roots, we can derive the required equalities.
