  Given that \( m \) and \( n \) are both positive real numbers, \( m^3 = 2 \), \( n^3 = 4 \), and \( a + b m + c n = 0 \) for rational numbers \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), we need to show that \( a = b = c = 0 \).
  1. **Normalization and Simplification**: We start by normalizing the given equations and simplifying them.
  2. **Inequality Analysis**: Using the properties of real numbers and the given inequalities \( m^3 = 2 \) and \( n^3 = 4 \), we infer that \( m \) and \( n \) must be specific values.
  3. **Equation Manipulation**: We manipulate the equation \( a + b m + c n = 0 \) to show that \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) must be zero.
  4. **Numerical Verification**: Finally, we use numerical methods to verify that the only solution to the system of equations is \( a = b = c = 0 \).
