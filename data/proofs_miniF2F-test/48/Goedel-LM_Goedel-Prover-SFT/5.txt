  Given that \( m \) and \( n \) are both positive real numbers, \( m^3 = 2 \), \( n^3 = 4 \), and \( a + bm + cn = 0 \) for rational numbers \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), we need to show that \( a = b = c = 0 \).
  1. **Non-negativity of Squares**: Since \( m \) and \( n \) are positive, their squares \( m^2 \) and \( n^2 \) are also positive.
  2. **Non-negativity of Products**: The products \( m \cdot n \), \( m \cdot a \), and \( n \cdot a \) are non-negative.
  3. **Non-negativity of Expressions**: The expressions \( (m \cdot n - 1)^2 \), \( (m \cdot a - b)^2 \), and \( (n \cdot a - c)^2 \) are non-negative.
  4. **Zero Sum Condition**: Using the non-negativity properties and the given equation \( a + bm + cn = 0 \), we can deduce that \( a = 0 \), \( b = 0 \), and \( c = 0 \).
