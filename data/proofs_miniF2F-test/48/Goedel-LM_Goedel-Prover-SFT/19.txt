  Given that \( m \) and \( n \) are positive real numbers, \( m^3 = 2 \), \( n^3 = 4 \), and \( a + bm + cn = 0 \) for rational numbers \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), we need to show that \( a = b = c = 0 \).
  1. From the given conditions, we have \( m^3 = 2 \) and \( n^3 = 4 \).
  2. Since \( m \) and \( n \) are positive, we can use the properties of powers and the given equations to derive the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).
  3. By substituting \( m \) and \( n \) into the equation \( a + bm + cn = 0 \), we can solve for \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).
  4. Using the fact that \( m^3 = 2 \) and \( n^3 = 4 \), we can derive that \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) must be zero to satisfy the equation \( a + bm + cn = 0 \).
