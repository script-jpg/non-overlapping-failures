  Given that \( m \) and \( n \) are both positive real numbers, \( m^3 = 2 \), \( n^3 = 4 \), and \( a + bm + cn = 0 \) for rational numbers \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), we need to show that \( a = b = c = 0 \).
  1. **Normalization and Simplification**:
     - We start by normalizing the numerical values in the given equations.
     - We use the properties of rational and real numbers to simplify the expressions.
  2. **Nonlinear Arithmetic**:
     - We apply nonlinear arithmetic to derive the necessary equalities.
     - Specifically, we use the fact that the squares of real numbers are non-negative to deduce that \( a = 0 \), \( b = 0 \), and \( c = 0 \).
