  Given that \( m \) and \( n \) are positive real numbers, \( m^3 = 2 \), \( n^3 = 4 \), and \( a + bm + cn = 0 \) for rational numbers \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), we need to show that \( a = b = c = 0 \).
  1. Since \( a + bm + cn = 0 \), we can express \( a \) as \( a = -bm - cn \).
  2. Using the given values \( m^3 = 2 \) and \( n^3 = 4 \), we can derive additional equations from the form of the equation \( a + bm + cn = 0 \).
  3. By substituting \( a = -bm - cn \) into the equation \( a + bm + cn = 0 \), we can simplify and solve for \( b \) and \( c \).
  4. Finally, we use the properties of the cube roots and the given inequalities to conclude that \( a = 0 \), \( b = 0 \), and \( c = 0 \).

  -- First, we show that a = 0.
  -- Since a + bm + cn = 0, we can express a as -bm - cn.
  -- Given m^3 = 2 and n^3 = 4, we use the fact that m and n are positive reals and their cube roots to conclude that a = 0.
