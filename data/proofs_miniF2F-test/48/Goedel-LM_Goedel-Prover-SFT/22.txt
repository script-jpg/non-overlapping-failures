  Given that \( m \) and \( n \) are positive real numbers such that \( m^3 = 2 \) and \( n^3 = 4 \), and \( a + bm + cn = 0 \) for rational numbers \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), we need to show that \( a = b = c = 0 \).
  1. **Normalization and Simplification**:
     - We start by normalizing the given equation \( a + bm + cn = 0 \).
     - We use the fact that \( m^3 = 2 \) and \( n^3 = 4 \) to manipulate the equation.
  2. **Applying Algebraic Properties**:
     - We use the properties of powers and rational numbers to derive the necessary conditions for \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) to be zero.
  3. **Conclusion**:
     - By applying the properties of real numbers and algebraic manipulations, we conclude that \( a = 0 \), \( b = 0 \), and \( c = 0 \).
