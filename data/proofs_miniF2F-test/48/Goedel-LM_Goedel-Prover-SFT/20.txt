  Given that \( m \) and \( n \) are both positive real numbers, \( m^3 = 2 \), \( n^3 = 4 \), and \( a + bm + cn = 0 \) for rational numbers \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), we need to show that \( a = b = c = 0 \).
  1. From \( m^3 = 2 \), we deduce that \( m \) is the cube root of 2.
  2. From \( n^3 = 4 \), we deduce that \( n \) is the cube root of 4.
  3. Since \( m \) and \( n \) are positive, we can use the properties of cube roots and the given equations to derive that \( a = 0 \), \( b = 0 \), and \( c = 0 \).
