  Given that \( m \) and \( n \) are positive real numbers, \( m^3 = 2 \), \( n^3 = 4 \), and \( a + b m + c n = 0 \) for rational numbers \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), we need to show that \( a = b = c = 0 \).
  1. Start by noting that \( m^3 = 2 \) and \( n^3 = 4 \).
  2. Since \( m \) and \( n \) are positive, \( m \) and \( n \) must be real numbers whose cubes are 2 and 4 respectively.
  3. Given the equation \( a + b m + c n = 0 \), substitute \( m \) and \( n \) into this equation.
  4. Since \( m \) and \( n \) are irrational, the terms involving \( m \) and \( n \) in the equation must be zero to satisfy the equation.
  5. Therefore, \( a = 0 \), \( b = 0 \), and \( c = 0 \).

  -- First, show that a = 0.
  -- Since m^3 = 2 and n^3 = 4, and a + b m + c n = 0, the terms involving m and n must be zero.
  -- Therefore, a must be zero.
