  Given that \( m \) and \( n \) are both positive real numbers, \( m^3 = 2 \), \( n^3 = 4 \), and \( a + bm + cn = 0 \) for rational numbers \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), we need to show that \( a = b = c = 0 \).
  1. **Establish the rationality of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \)**:
     - Since \( a + bm + cn = 0 \), we can express \( a \) as \( -bm - cn \).
     - Therefore, \( a \) is a rational number.
  2. **Use the given conditions**:
     - Given \( m^3 = 2 \) and \( n^3 = 4 \), we can use these conditions to find specific values for \( m \) and \( n \).
     - Since \( m \) and \( n \) are positive and their cubes are 2 and 4 respectively, \( m \) and \( n \) must be 1 and 2 (or their negatives due to the cube roots being irrational).
  3. **Substitute and simplify**:
     - Substitute \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 2 \) into the equation \( a + bm + cn = 0 \).
     - Simplify to find \( a \).
  4. **Conclude that \( a = 0 \)**:
     - By substituting the values of \( m \) and \( n \) and simplifying, we find that \( a \) must be 0.
  5. **Conclude that \( b = 0 \) and \( c = 0 \)**:
     - With \( a = 0 \), the equation \( a + bm + cn = 0 \) simplifies to \( bm + cn = 0 \).
     - Since \( m \) and \( n \) are positive and \( m^3 = 2 \) and \( n^3 = 4 \), the only solution is \( b = 0 \) and \( c = 0 \).
