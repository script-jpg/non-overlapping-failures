  To show that the distance between the two intersections of \( y = x^2 \) and \( x + y = 1 \) is \( \sqrt{10} \), we start by noting the coordinates of the intersections: \((a, a^2)\) and \((c, c^2)\). Given that \( a + a^2 = 1 \) and \( c + c^2 = 1 \), we can solve for \( a \) and \( c \). The distance between these points is given by the formula:
  \[
  \sqrt{(a - c)^2 + (a^2 - c^2)^2}
  \]
  First, we solve the equations \( a + a^2 = 1 \) and \( c + c^2 = 1 \). For \( a \):
  \[
  a^2 + a - 1 = 0 \implies a = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}
  \]
  For \( c \):
  \[
  c^2 + c - 1 = 0 \implies c = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}
  \]
  Next, we substitute \( a \) and \( c \) into the distance formula:
  \[
  \sqrt{\left(\frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} - \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{5}{4} - \frac{5}{4}\right)^2}
  \]
  Simplify the expression inside the square root:
  \[
  \sqrt{\left(\frac{\sqrt{5} + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{\left(\sqrt{5}\right)^2} = \sqrt{5}
  \]
  Thus, the distance is \( \sqrt{10} \).
