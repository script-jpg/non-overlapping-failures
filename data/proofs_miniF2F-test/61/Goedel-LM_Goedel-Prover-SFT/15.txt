  To show that the distance between the two intersections of \( y = x^2 \) and \( x + y = 1 \) is \( \sqrt{10} \), we start by noting the coordinates of the intersections. Let the coordinates of the first intersection be \( (a, b) \) and the coordinates of the second intersection be \( (c, d) \). We are given the following equations:
  1. \( b = a^2 \)
  2. \( a + b = 1 \)
  3. \( d = c^2 \)
  4. \( c + d = 1 \)
  5. \( a \neq c \)
  First, we solve for \( b \) and \( d \) using the given equations. From \( a + b = 1 \), we get \( b = 1 - a \). Substituting \( b = a^2 \) into this equation, we obtain \( a^2 = 1 - a \). Solving this quadratic equation, we find \( a = \frac{1}{2} \) or \( a = -2 \). Since \( a \neq c \), we can assume \( a = \frac{1}{2} \) without loss of generality.
  Next, substituting \( a = \frac{1}{2} \) into \( b = a^2 \), we get \( b = \frac{1}{4} \).
  Similarly, from \( c + d = 1 \), we get \( d = 1 - c \). Substituting \( d = c^2 \) into this equation, we obtain \( c^2 = 1 - c \). Solving this quadratic equation, we find \( c = \frac{1}{2} \) or \( c = -2 \). Since \( a \neq c \), we can assume \( c = \frac{1}{2} \) without loss of generality.
  Substituting \( c = \frac{1}{2} \) into \( d = c^2 \), we get \( d = \frac{1}{4} \).
  Now, we calculate the distance between the points \( \left( \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4} \right) \) and \( \left( \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4} \right) \). The distance formula is given by:
  \[ \text{Distance} = \sqrt{(a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2} \]
  Substituting the values, we get:
  \[ \text{Distance} = \sqrt{\left( \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{4} \right)^2} = \sqrt{0 + 0} = \sqrt{0} = 0 \]
  However, this is incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the problem. We need to show that the distance is \( \sqrt{10} \).
