  To show that the distance between the two intersections of \( y = x^2 \) and \( x + y = 1 \) is \( \sqrt{10} \), we start by finding the points of intersection. The equations \( y = x^2 \) and \( x + y = 1 \) can be solved simultaneously. Substituting \( y = x^2 \) into \( x + y = 1 \), we get \( x + x^2 = 1 \). Solving this quadratic equation, we find the roots \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 1 \). Correspondingly, \( y = 1 \) and \( y = 1 \). Thus, the points of intersection are \( (-1, 1) \) and \( (1, 1) \).
  The distance between these points is calculated using the distance formula:
  \[
  \sqrt{(1 - (-1))^2 + (1 - 1)^2} = \sqrt{(1 + 1)^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{2^2} = \sqrt{4} = 2
  \]
  However, this result seems incorrect based on the given problem statement. Let's re-evaluate the points and the distance calculation. The correct points should be \( (0, 1) \) and \( (1, 1) \), as they satisfy both equations. The correct distance should be:
  \[
  \sqrt{(1 - 0)^2 + (1 - 1)^2} = \sqrt{1^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{1} = 1
  \]
  This still does not match the expected result. Let's correct the points to \( (0, 1) \) and \( (1, 1) \) and re-check the distance calculation.
