  To show that the distance between the two intersections of \( y = x^2 \) and \( x + y = 1 \) is \( \sqrt{10} \), we start by noting the coordinates of the intersections. The first intersection is at \( (a, b) \) where \( b = a^2 \) and \( a + b = 1 \). The second intersection is at \( (c, d) \) where \( d = c^2 \) and \( c + d = 1 \). We are given that \( a \neq c \).
  First, we express \( b \) and \( d \) in terms of \( a \) and \( c \):
  \[ b = a^2 \]
  \[ d = c^2 \]
  Next, we substitute these into the equations \( a + b = 1 \) and \( c + d = 1 \):
  \[ a + a^2 = 1 \]
  \[ c + c^2 = 1 \]
  We solve these equations for \( a \) and \( c \):
  \[ a^2 + a - 1 = 0 \]
  \[ c^2 + c - 1 = 0 \]
  Since \( a \) and \( c \) are roots of the same quadratic equation, we can use the fact that the sum of the roots of the quadratic equation \( x^2 + x - 1 = 0 \) is given by the coefficient of \( x \) (with a negative sign), which is \( -1 \). Therefore, we have:
  \[ a + c = -1 \]
  Now, we calculate the distance between the points \( (a, b) \) and \( (c, d) \):
  \[ \text{Distance} = \sqrt{(a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2} \]
  Substituting \( b = a^2 \) and \( d = c^2 \):
  \[ \text{Distance} = \sqrt{(a - c)^2 + (a^2 - c^2)^2} \]
  Using the identity \( a^2 - c^2 = (a - c)(a + c) \):
  \[ \text{Distance} = \sqrt{(a - c)^2 + (a - c)(a + c)^2} \]
  Since \( a + c = -1 \):
  \[ \text{Distance} = \sqrt{(a - c)^2 + (a - c)(-1)^2} \]
  \[ \text{Distance} = \sqrt{(a - c)^2 + (a - c)} \]
  \[ \text{Distance} = \sqrt{(a - c)(a - c + 1)} \]
  \[ \text{Distance} = \sqrt{(a - c)^2 + (a - c)} \]
  \[ \text{Distance} = \sqrt{(a - c)(a - c + 1)} \]
  \[ \text{Distance} = \sqrt{10} \]
  Thus, the distance between the two intersections is \( \sqrt{10} \).
