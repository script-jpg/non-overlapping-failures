  To find the distance between the two intersections of the curves \( y = x^2 \) and \( x + y = 1 \), we start by defining the coordinates of the intersections as \((a, b)\) and \((c, d)\). Given the equations \( b = a^2 \) and \( a + b = 1 \), we can solve for \( a \) and \( b \). Similarly, from \( d = c^2 \) and \( c + d = 1 \), we solve for \( c \) and \( d \). We then compute the distance between the points \((a, b)\) and \((c, d)\) using the formula for the distance between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\), which is \(\sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2}\).
