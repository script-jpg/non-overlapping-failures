  To show that the distance between the two intersections of \( y = x^2 \) and \( x + y = 1 \) is \( \sqrt{10} \), we start by finding the coordinates of the intersections.
  1. From \( y = x^2 \) and \( x + y = 1 \), we substitute \( y \) in the second equation to get \( x + x^2 = 1 \).
  2. Solving this quadratic equation, we find \( x = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2} \).
  3. Since we are looking for the distance between two points, we use the distance formula: \( \sqrt{(a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2} \).
  4. Given the points \( (a, b) \) and \( (c, d) \), we have \( a = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), \( b = \left(\frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^2 \), \( c = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \), and \( d = \left(\frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^2 \).
  5. Substituting these values into the distance formula, we simplify and find that the distance is \( \sqrt{10} \).
