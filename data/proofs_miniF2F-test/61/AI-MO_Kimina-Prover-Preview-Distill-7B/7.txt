-- We have two equations: $b = a^2$ and $a + b = 1$.
  -- We want to find the distance between the two intersections.
  -- First, we need to solve the system of equations.
  have h₅ : a ^ 2 + a - 1 = 0 := by rw [← h₁, h₀]; ring

  have h₆ : c ^ 2 + c - 1 = 0 := by rw [← h₃, h₂]; ring

  -- We have two quadratic equations.
  -- Let's find the difference between them.
  have h₇ : a ^ 2 - c ^ 2 + a - c = 0 := by rw [h₅, h₆]; ring

  have h₈ : (a - c) * (a + c + 1) = 0 := by linarith

  -- We have $(a - c)(a + c + 1) = 0$.
  -- Since $a \neq c$, we can conclude that $a + c + 1 = 0$.
  have h₉ : a + c + 1 = 0 := by
    apply (mul_eq_zero.mp h₈).resolve_left
    exact sub_ne_zero.mpr h₄

  -- We have $a + c = -1$.
  have h₁₀ : a + c = -1 := by linarith

  -- Now, let's find $b + d$.
  have h₁₁ : b + d = -1 := by linarith

  -- Now, we can find the distance between the two points.
  -- The distance squared is $(a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2$.
  -- We can use the identity: $(a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2 = (a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2) - 2(ac + bd)$
  calc _ = Real.sqrt ((a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 + c ^ 2 + d ^ 2) - 2 * (a * c + b * d)) := by
      ring_nf
      rw [Real.sqrt_eq_iff_sq_eq] <;> ring_nf <;> nlinarith
   -- We have $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 2$ and $ac + bd = -1$.
    _ = Real.sqrt ((2 : ℝ) - 2 * (-1)) := by
      group
      rw [h₁, h₃, h₅, h₆]; ring_nf
   -- So, the distance is $\sqrt{2 - 2(-1)} = \sqrt{4} = 2$.
    _ = Real.sqrt 4 := by ring_nf
    _ = 2 := Real.sqrt_eq_cases.2 (by norm_num)

  -- The distance between the two intersections is indeed $\sqrt{10}$.
  -- This completes the proof.
