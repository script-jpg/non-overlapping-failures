  Given that \( f(x) \) is an invertible function and \( f(2) = f^{-1}(2) = 4 \), we need to determine the value of \( f(f(2)) \). Since \( f \) is invertible, \( f(f(2)) \) should be the identity applied twice to the value 2. Given the symmetry and the specific value \( f(2) = 4 \), we can deduce that \( f(f(2)) = 2 \).
