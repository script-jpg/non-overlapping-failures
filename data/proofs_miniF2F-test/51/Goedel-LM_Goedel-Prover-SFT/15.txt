  Given an invertible function \( f \) and the condition \( f(2) = f^{-1}(2) = 4 \), we need to determine the value of \( f(f(2)) \).
  1. From the given condition, we know that \( f(2) = 4 \) and \( f^{-1}(2) = 4 \).
  2. To find \( f(f(2)) \), we first compute \( f(2) \).
  3. Since \( f(2) = 4 \), we apply \( f \) to 4, yielding \( f(4) \).
  4. Given \( f^{-1}(2) = 4 \), it follows that \( f(4) = 2 \).
  5. Therefore, \( f(f(2)) = f(4) = 2 \).
