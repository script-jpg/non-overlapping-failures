  Given an invertible function \( f \) and the condition \( f(2) = f^{-1}(2) = 4 \), we need to determine the value of \( f(f(2)) \). Since \( f \) is invertible, we can apply the inverse function property to \( f(2) \). Given \( f(2) = 4 \), we have \( f^{-1}(4) = 2 \). Therefore, \( f(f(2)) = f(4) = 2 \).
