  Given that \( f(x) \) is an invertible function and \( f(2) = f^{-1}(2) = 4 \), we need to determine the value of \( f(f(2)) \).
  1. From the given condition \( f(2) = 4 \), we know that \( f(2) = f^{-1}(2) \).
  2. Using the property of the inverse function, \( f^{-1}(f(2)) = 2 \).
  3. Substituting \( f(2) \) with 4, we get \( f^{-1}(4) = 2 \).
  4. Since \( f \) is invertible, \( f^{-1} \) is also invertible, and we can apply \( f \) to both sides of the equation \( f^{-1}(4) = 2 \).
  5. Therefore, \( f(f^{-1}(4)) = f(2) \).
  6. Given \( f(2) = 4 \), we have \( f(f^{-1}(4)) = 4 \).
  7. Since \( f \) is invertible, \( f^{-1}(f(f^{-1}(4))) = f^{-1}(4) \).
  8. Therefore, \( f^{-1}(f(f^{-1}(4))) = 2 \).
  9. Finally, applying \( f \) to both sides, we get \( f(f(f^{-1}(4))) = f(2) \).
  10. Since \( f(2) = 4 \), we have \( f(f(f^{-1}(4))) = 4 \).
  Thus, the value of \( f(f(2)) \) is \( 2 \).

  -- We need to show that f(f(2)) = 2.
  -- By the property of the inverse function, f⁻¹(f(2)) = 2.
  -- Therefore, f(f⁻¹(f(2))) = f(2).
  -- Since f(2) = 4, we have f(f⁻¹(4)) = 4.
  -- Since f is invertible, f⁻¹(f(f⁻¹(4))) = f⁻¹(4).
  -- Therefore, f⁻¹(f(f⁻¹(4))) = 2.
  -- Finally, applying f to both sides, we get f(f(f⁻¹(4))) = f(2).
  -- Since f(2) = 4, we have f(f(f⁻¹(4))) = 4.
