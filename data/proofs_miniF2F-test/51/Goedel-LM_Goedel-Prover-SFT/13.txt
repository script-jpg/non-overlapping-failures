  Given an invertible function \( f \) and the condition \( f(2) = f^{-1}(2) = 4 \), we need to determine the value of \( f(f(2)) \).
  1. From the given condition, we know that \( f(2) = 4 \) and \( f^{-1}(4) = 2 \).
  2. Applying the function \( f \) again to both sides of the equation \( f(2) = 4 \), we get \( f(4) = f(f(2)) \).
  3. Since \( f \) is invertible, we can use the property of the inverse function to rewrite \( f(4) \) as \( f(f^{-1}(4)) \).
  4. Given \( f^{-1}(4) = 2 \), we have \( f(4) = f(2) \).
  5. Therefore, \( f(f(2)) = f(2) \).
  6. Since \( f(2) = 4 \), we conclude that \( f(f(2)) = 4 \).
