  Given an invertible function \( f \) and the condition \( f(2) = f^{-1}(2) = 4 \), we need to determine the value of \( f(f(2)) \).
  1. From the given condition, we know that \( f(2) = 4 \) and \( f^{-1}(2) = 4 \).
  2. Since \( f \) is an invertible function, applying \( f \) to both sides of the equation \( f^{-1}(2) = 4 \) gives \( f(4) = 2 \).
  3. Therefore, \( f(f(2)) = f(4) = 2 \).

  -- We start by noting that f(2) = 4 and f⁻¹(2) = 4.
  -- Since f is invertible, applying f to both sides of f⁻¹(2) = 4 gives f(4) = 2.

  -- Now we need to find f(f(2)), which is f(4).
  -- Since f(4) = 2, we conclude that f(f(2)) = 2.
