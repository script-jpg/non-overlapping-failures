  Given that \( f(x) \) is an invertible function and \( f(2) = f^{-1}(2) = 4 \), we need to determine the value of \( f(f(2)) \). Since \( f \) is invertible, we can use the properties of the inverse function to find \( f(f(2)) \). Specifically, we know that \( f(2) = 4 \) and \( f^{-1}(4) = 2 \). Therefore, \( f(f(2)) = f(4) \). Given that \( f(4) = 2 \), we conclude that \( f(f(2)) = 2 \).

  -- The simplification step uses the fact that σ.1 2 = σ.2 2, which implies σ.1 (σ.1 2) = 2.
