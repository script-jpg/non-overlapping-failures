  Given that \( f(x) \) is an invertible function, and we know that \( f(2) = f^{-1}(2) = 4 \), we need to find the value of \( f(f(2)) \). By the properties of invertible functions, \( f(f(2)) \) should be the value that maps to 2 under \( f \). Since \( f(2) = 4 \) and \( f^{-1}(2) = 4 \), we can use the property of the inverse function that \( f^{-1}(f(a)) = a \) for any \( a \). Therefore, \( f(f(2)) = f(4) \). Given the identity of \( f \), we have \( f(4) = 4 \). Thus, \( f(f(2)) = 2 \).
