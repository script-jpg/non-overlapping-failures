  Given an invertible function \( f(x) \) and the condition \( f(2) = f^{-1}(2) = 4 \), we need to determine the value of \( f(f(2)) \).
  1. From the given condition \( f(2) = 4 \), we know that \( f(2) \) maps to 4 under the function \( f \).
  2. Since \( f \) is invertible, \( f^{-1}(4) \) must also be 2.
  3. Therefore, \( f(f(2)) = f(4) = 2 \).
