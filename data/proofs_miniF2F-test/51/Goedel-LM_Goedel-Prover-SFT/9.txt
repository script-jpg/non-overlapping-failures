  Given that \( f(x) \) is an invertible function and \( f(2) = f^{-1}(2) = 4 \), we need to determine the value of \( f(f(2)) \). By the properties of invertible functions, \( f(f(2)) \) should be the value that maps to 2 under the function \( f \). Since \( f(2) = 4 \), we need to find \( f(4) \). Given the symmetry of the function, we can infer that \( f(4) = 2 \).

  -- We start by using the fact that f(2) = 4 and the function is invertible.
  have h₁ := σ.apply_eq_iff_eq_symm_apply.mpr h
  -- Simplify the expression to show that 2 is indeed the inverse value of 4.
  simp at h₁
  -- Use the property of the function being invertible to infer that f(f(2)) = 2.
  rw [← h₁]
  -- Simplify the final expression to confirm the result.
