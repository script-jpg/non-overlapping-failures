  Given that \( f(x) \) is an invertible function and \( f(2) = f^{-1}(2) = 4 \), we need to determine the value of \( f(f(2)) \).
  1. From the given condition \( f(2) = f^{-1}(2) = 4 \), we know that \( f(4) = 2 \) because \( f \) is invertible.
  2. Applying the inverse function property again, since \( f(4) = 2 \), we have \( f(f(4)) = f(2) \).
  3. Substituting \( f(4) = 2 \) into the equation, we get \( f(2) = 2 \).
  Thus, the value of \( f(f(2)) \) is \( 2 \).
