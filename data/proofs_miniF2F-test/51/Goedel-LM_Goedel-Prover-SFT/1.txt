  Given that \( f(x) \) is an invertible function and \( f(2) = f^{-1}(2) = 4 \), we need to determine the value of \( f(f(2)) \). By the properties of invertible functions, we know that \( f(f^{-1}(x)) = x \) for any \( x \) in the range of \( f \). Since \( f(2) = 4 \) and \( f^{-1}(4) = 2 \), it follows that \( f(f(2)) = f(4) = 2 \).

  -- We know that σ.1 2 = σ.2 2 from the given hypothesis.
  have h₁ : σ.1 2 = σ.2 2 := h
  -- We also know that σ.2 (σ.1 2) = 2 because σ is an invertible function.
  have h₂ : σ.2 (σ.1 2) = 2 := by simp [h₁]
  -- Simplify the expression to show that σ.1 (σ.1 2) = 2.
  simp [h₂]
