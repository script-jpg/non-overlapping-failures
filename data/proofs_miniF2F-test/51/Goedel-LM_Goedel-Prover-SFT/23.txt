  Given an invertible function \( f(x) \) and the condition \( f(2) = f^{-1}(2) = 4 \), we need to determine the value of \( f(f(2)) \).
  1. From the given condition \( f(2) = 4 \), we know that \( \sigma(2) = 4 \).
  2. From the condition \( f^{-1}(2) = 4 \), we know that \( \sigma^{-1}(4) = 2 \).
  3. To find \( f(f(2)) \), we need to compute \( \sigma(\sigma(2)) \).
  4. Substituting \( \sigma(2) = 4 \) into the computation, we get \( \sigma(4) \).
  5. Given \( \sigma^{-1}(4) = 2 \), we can infer that \( \sigma(4) = 2 \).
  6. Therefore, \( f(f(2)) = 2 \).
