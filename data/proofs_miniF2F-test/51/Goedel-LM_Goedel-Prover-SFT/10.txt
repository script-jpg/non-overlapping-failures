  Given that \( f(x) \) is an invertible function and \( f(2) = f^{-1}(2) = 4 \), we need to determine the value of \( f(f(2)) \).
  1. From the given condition \( f(2) = 4 \), we know that \( f(2) = 4 \).
  2. Since \( f \) is invertible, \( f(f(2)) \) must be the value such that \( f(f(2)) = 4 \).
  3. Given \( f(2) = 4 \), we need to find \( f(f(2)) \).
  4. By the definition of the inverse function, \( f(f(2)) = f(4) \).
  5. Since \( f(4) = 2 \), we have \( f(f(2)) = 2 \).

  -- We start by using the given equality σ.1 2 = σ.2 2
  have h₁ := h
  -- We need to find σ.1 (σ.1 2)
  have h₂ : σ.1 (σ.1 2) = 2 := by
    -- Since σ.1 2 = σ.2 2, we can use σ.2 2 to find σ.1 (σ.1 2)
    simp only [Equiv.eq_symm_apply] at h₁
    -- By the definition of the inverse function, σ.1 (σ.1 2) = σ.1 (σ.2 2)
    -- Given σ.1 2 = 4, we have σ.1 (σ.1 2) = σ.1 4
    -- Since σ.1 4 = 2, we conclude σ.1 (σ.1 2) = 2
    simp [h₁]
  -- Finally, we have the desired result
  exact h₂
