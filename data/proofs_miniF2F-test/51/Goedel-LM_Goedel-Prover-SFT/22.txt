  Given that \( f(x) \) is an invertible function and \( f(2) = f^{-1}(2) = 4 \), we need to determine the value of \( f(f(2)) \). Since \( f \) is invertible, we can use the property of the inverse function. Specifically, for any \( a \) in the domain of \( f \), \( f(f^{-1}(a)) = a \). Applying this property, we find that \( f^{-1}(f(2)) = 2 \). Therefore, \( f(f(2)) = f(4) \). Given that \( f(2) = 4 \), we can deduce that \( f(4) = 2 \). Thus, the value of \( f(f(2)) \) is 2.
