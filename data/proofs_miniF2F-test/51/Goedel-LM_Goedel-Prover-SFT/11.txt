  Given that \( f(x) \) is an invertible function and \( f(2) = f^{-1}(2) = 4 \), we need to determine the value of \( f(f(2)) \).
  1. From the given conditions, we know \( f(2) = 4 \) and \( f^{-1}(2) = 4 \).
  2. Since \( f \) is invertible, \( f(4) = 2 \).
  3. We need to find \( f(f(2)) \).
  4. Using the given information, we have \( f(2) = 4 \).
  5. Therefore, \( f(f(2)) = f(4) \).
  6. From the given conditions, \( f(4) = 2 \).
  7. Thus, \( f(f(2)) = 2 \).
