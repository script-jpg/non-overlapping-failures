-- The function $f$ is invertible.
  obtain ⟨σ, hσ⟩ := h

  -- The function $f$ satisfies $f(2) = 4$.
  have h1 : σ.1 2 = 4 := by
    rw [hσ]

  -- The function $f$ satisfies $f^{-1}(2) = 4$, or equivalently, $f(4) = 2$.
  have h2 : σ.2 2 = 4 := by
    rw [hσ]

  -- By the symmetry of the inverse function, we have $f(4) = 2$.
  have h3 : σ.1 4 = 2 := by
    rw [← h2, hσ]

  -- Combining the above two equations, we have $f(f(2)) = f(4) = 2$.
