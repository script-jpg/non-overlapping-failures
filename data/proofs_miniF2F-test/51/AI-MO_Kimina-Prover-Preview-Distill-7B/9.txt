-- The fact that $f(f(2))=2$ is an immediate consequence of the assumption that $f$ is invertible.
  -- This is because if a function $f$ is invertible, then $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$ for all $x$ in $f$'s domain.
  -- Applying $f$ to both sides of the equation $f^{-1}(2)=4$, we get $f(f^{-1}(2))=f(4)$.
  -- Since $f(f^{-1}(x)) = x$ for all $x$ in the range of $f$, we get $2=f(4)$.
  -- Then, applying $f$ to both sides of the equation $f(2)=4$, we get $f(f(2))=f(4)=2$.
