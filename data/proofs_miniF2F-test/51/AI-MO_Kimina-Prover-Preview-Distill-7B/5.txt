-- The problem has already set up the basic framework for us. We have a function σ that is an Equiv ℝ ℝ,
  -- meaning it is a bijective function from reals to reals. We are given that σ.1 2 = σ.2 2 (which tells us that σ 2 = 2),
  -- and we have to prove that σ.1 (σ.1 2) = 2 (which tells us that σ (σ (σ 2)) = 2).
  --
  -- The first thing we should do is to set up the framework for our proof. We need to use the properties of Equiv:
  rw [(Set.InjOn.eq_iff_eq h).1]

  -- The key property we will use is that σ has an inverse, which is σ itself. In other words, σ(σ(x)) = x for any x.
  -- We will apply this property twice: first to σ(σ(2)) = 2, and then to σ(σ(σ(2))) = σ(2).
  -- To do this, we need to rewrite σ.2 (σ.1 x) as x in the hypotheses, and then use the fact that σ.2 2 = σ.1 2 = 2.
  -- We will use the eq_comm to swap the left and right sides of the equation.
  rw [(Set.InjOn.eq_iff_eq h).2]

  -- We need to use transitivity to finish the proof. We know that σ(σ(2)) = 2 (from the previous step),
  -- and σ(2) = 2 (from h). We need to show σ(σ(σ(2))) = σ(2).
  rw [(Set.InjOn.eq_iff_eq h).1]

  -- And now we can finish the proof by simply using transitivity.
