-- The fact that $f(2) = 4$ is expressed by the hypothesis h : σ.1 2 = σ.2 2.
  -- The fact that $f^{-1}(2) = 4$ means that $f(4) = 2$, which is expressed by the
  -- hypothesis h : σ.1 (σ.1 2) = 2.
  -- We have to prove that $f(f(2)) = 2$, which is expressed by the goal σ.1 (σ.1 (σ.1 2)) = 2.
  -- This can be proved by rewriting the goal by the hypothesis h, which gives σ.1 2 = 2,
  -- and this can be proved again by rewriting by the hypothesis h.
