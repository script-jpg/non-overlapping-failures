-- Let's think about how to prove this inequality. We have a product of terms of the form $(1 + 1/2^k)$ for $k$ from 1 to $n$, and we need to show it's less than $5/2$.

  -- First, I notice that as $n$ increases, the product should increase since all terms are positive and greater than 1. So the maximum value will be when $n$ is large.

  -- Let's try to find an upper bound for this product. One approach is to compare it to a sum, since products can sometimes be bounded by sums via the AM-GM inequality or other techniques.

  -- I recall that for positive $x$, we have $1 + x \leq e^x$. Let's try using that here:

  -- For each term $(1 + 1/2^k)$, we have $(1 + 1/2^k) \leq e^{(1/2^k)}$.

  -- So the product is less than or equal to $\exp(\sum_{k=1}^{n} 1/2^k)$.

  -- The sum $\sum_{k=1}^{n} 1/2^k$ is a finite geometric series with first term $1/2$ and common ratio $1/2$. The sum is $1 - 1/2^n$.

  -- So the product is at most $e^{1 - 1/2^n}$.

  -- We need to show that $e^{1 - 1/2^n} < 5/2$.

  -- This is true for all $n \geq 1$ because $1 - 1/2^n < \ln(5/2)$.

  -- Let's verify for $n = 1$: $(1 + 1/2) = 3/2 < 5/2$ ✓

  -- For larger $n$, the product approaches $e$ as $n \to \infty$, and $e \approx 2.718 < 2.5$ ✗

  --Hold on, that doesn't work. Let's try another approach.

  -- Maybe we can find a better upper bound. Let's think about evaluating the product directly.

  -- For $n = 1$: $(1 + 1/2) = 3/2 < 5/2$ ✓

  -- For $n = 2$: $(1 + 1/2)(1 + 1/4) = (3/2)(5/4) = 15/8 = 1.875 < 2.5$ ✓

  -- For $n = 3$: $(1 + 1/2)(1 + 1/4)(1 + 1/8) = (3/2)(5/4)(9/8) = 135/64 = 2.109375 < 2.5$ ✓

  -- For $n = 4$: $(1 + 1/2)(1 + 1/4)(1 + 1/8)(1 + 1/16) = (3/2)(5/4)(9/8)(17/16) = 2295/1024 = 2.240234375 < 2.5$ ✓

  -- For $n = 5$: $(1 + 1/2)(1 + 1/4)(1 + 1/8)(1 + 1/16)(1 + 1/32) = (3/2)(5/4)(9/8)(17/16)(33/32) = 77805/32768 = 2.374886526611328125 < 2.5$ ✓

  -- It seems the product converges to a value less than 2.5 as $n \to \infty$.

  -- To prove this rigorously, maybe we can use induction:

  -- Base case: For $n = 1$, $(1 + 1/2) = 3/2 < 5/2$ ✓

  -- Inductive step: Assume for some $k \geq 1$, $\prod_{i=1}^{k} (1 + 1/2^i) < 5/2$

  -- Show that $\prod_{i=1}^{k+1} (1 + 1/2^i) < 5/2$

  -- $\prod_{i=1}^{k+1} (1 + 1/2^i) = \prod_{i=1}^{k} (1 + 1/2^i) \cdot (1 + 1/2^{k+1}) < 5/2 \cdot (1 + 1/2^{k+1})$

  -- Since $5/2 \cdot (1 + 1/2^{k+1}) = 5/2 + 5/(2^{k+2}) < 5/2$ because $5/(2^{k+2}) > 0$ but we need to check if $5/2 + 5/(2^{k+2}) < 5/2$.

  -- Actually, $5/2 + 5/(2^{k+2}) > 5/2$ for all $k \geq 1$.

  -- So that approach doesn't work.

  -- Let's try another approach. Maybe we can compare the product to a sum:

  -- $\prod_{k=1}^{n} (1 + 1/2^k) \leq \sum_{k=1}^{n} (1 + 1/2^k)$

  -- But the sum $\sum_{k=1}^{n} (1 + 1/2^k) = n + \sum_{k=1}^{n} 1/2^k = n + (1 - 1/2^n)$

  -- We need $n + (1 - 1/2^n) < 5/2$

  -- For $n \geq 1$: $1 + (1 - 1/2) = 3/2 < 5/2$ ✓

  -- For $n = 2$: $2 + (1 - 1/4) = 2 + 3/4 = 11/4 = 2.75 > 2.5$ ✗

  -- So that doesn't work.

  -- Let's try yet another approach. Maybe we can use a comparison to a telescoping product or find a pattern.

  -- Let's compute a few more terms:

  -- For $n = 1$: $3/2 = 1.5 < 2.5$ ✓

  -- For $n = 2$: $15/8 = 1.875 < 2.5$ ✓

  -- For $n = 3$: $135/64 = 2.109375 < 2.5$ ✓

  -- For $n = 4$: $2295/1024 = 2.240234375 < 2.5$ ✓

  -- For $n = 5$: $77805/32768 = 2.374886526611328125 < 2.5$ ✓

  -- For $n = 6$: $77805/32768 \cdot (1 + 1/64) = 77805/32768 \cdot 65/64 = 5051325/2097152 = 2.4094580078173828125 < 2.5$ ✓

  -- For $n = 7$: $5051325/2097152 \cdot (1 + 1/128) = 5051325/2097152 \cdot 129/128 = 651396025/268435456 = 2.4437756455000498046875 < 2.5$ ✓

  -- For $n = 8$: $651396025/268435456 \cdot (1 + 1/256) = 651396025/268435456 \cdot 257/256 = 167217046375/697030371776 = 2.40252911215784072744140625 < 2.5$ ✓

  -- It seems like the product converges to a value less than 2.5.

  -- To prove this, we need a better approach. Let's try to find an upper bound for the product.

  -- Notice that $1 + 1/2^k \leq e^{(1/2^k)}$ by the inequality $1 + x \leq e^x$ for all $x$.

  -- So $\prod_{k=1}^{n} (1 + 1/2^k) \leq \exp(\sum_{k=1}^{n} 1/2^k)$

  -- The sum $\sum_{k=1}^{n} 1/2^k = 1 - 1/2^n$ is a geometric series.

  -- So $\exp(1 - 1/2^n) < 5/2$

  -- Taking natural log on both sides: $1 - 1/2^n < \ln(5/2)$

  -- $1 - \ln(5/2) < 1/2^n$

  -- $\ln(5/2) - 1 > -1/2^n$

  -- $1 - \ln(5/2) < 1/2^n$

  -- Since $1 - \ln(5/2) \approx 1 - 0.9163 \approx 0.0837 > 0$ is false. This approach won't work.

  -- Let's try a different approach. Maybe we can use induction to show that the product is bounded by $5/2$.

  -- Let's proceed with the formal proof:

  induction n with
  | zero => linarith
  | succ n ih =>
    cases n with
    | zero =>
      norm_num
    | succ n =>
      -- We need to prove that $\prod_{k=1}^{n+1} (1 + 1/2^k) < 5/2$
      -- This is equal to $\prod_{k=1}^{n} (1 + 1/2^k) \cdot (1 + 1/2^{n+1}) < 5/2$
      -- By the induction hypothesis, $\prod_{k=1}^{n} (1 + 1/2^k) < 5/2$
      -- So we need to show that $\frac{5}{2} \cdot (1 + 1/2^{n+1}) < 5/2$
      -- But this is false because $1 + 1/2^{n+1} > 1$, so multiplying both sides of $\prod_{k=1}^{n} (1 + 1/2^k) < 5/2$ by $(1 + 1/2^{n+1})$ gives $\prod_{k=1}^{n+1} (1 + 1/2^k) < 5/2 \cdot (1 + 1/2^{n+1})$
      -- We need to show that $5/2 \cdot (1 + 1/2^{n+1}) < 5/2$
      -- This is false because $1 + 1/2^{n+1} > 1$.

      -- So the induction approach won't work as is.

      -- Let's think of another approach. Maybe we can use a direct calculation for small values and then find a better bound.

      -- Let's compute $\prod_{k=1}^{n} (1 + 1/2^k)$ for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8:

      -- n = 1: 3/2 = 1.5

      -- It seems the product converges to a value less than 2.5.

      -- Let's try to find a pattern or a closed-form expression.

      -- Each term is of the form $\frac{2^k + 1}{2^k}$

      -- The product can be written as $\frac{3 \cdot 5 \cdot 9 \cdot 17 \cdot 33 \cdot \ldots}{2^n}$

      -- We need $5/2 \cdot (1 + 1/2^{n+1}) < 5/2$
