induction' h₀ with n h₀ IH
  -- Base case: n = 1
  -- When n = 1, the product is simply (1 + 1/2^1) = 1.5, which is less than 2.5.
  · norm_num [Finset.prod_Icc_succ_top]
  -- Inductive step: Assume the product is less than 2.5 for some n, and show it holds for n+1.
  · rw [Finset.prod_Icc_succ_top (Nat.succ_le_succ (Nat.zero_le n))]
    -- Rewrite the product to include the next term in the sequence.
    refine' (mul_lt_mul_of_pos_right IH _).trans_le _
    -- Use the fact that the product up to n is less than 2.5 and show the next term is positive.
    · positivity
    -- Simplify the expression to show it remains less than or equal to 2.5.
