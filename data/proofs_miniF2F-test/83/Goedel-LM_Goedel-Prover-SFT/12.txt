  We aim to show that for a positive integer \( n \), the product \(\prod_{k=1}^{n} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right)\) is less than \(\frac{5}{2}\). We will use mathematical induction to prove this statement.
  **Base Case:**
  For \( n = 1 \), the product is:
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^{1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) = \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^1}\right) = 1 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2}
  \]
  We need to show that \(\frac{3}{2} < \frac{5}{2}\), which is true.
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n = m \), i.e.,
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^{m} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) < \frac{5}{2}
  \]
  We need to show it holds for \( n = m + 1 \):
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^{m+1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) < \frac{5}{2}
  \]
  Using the inductive hypothesis, we have:
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^{m+1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) = \left(\prod_{k=1}^{m} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right)\right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^{m+1}}\right)
  \]
  By the inductive hypothesis, this is less than:
  \[
  \frac{5}{2} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^{m+1}}\right)
  \]
  We need to show that:
  \[
  \frac{5}{2} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^{m+1}}\right) < \frac{5}{2}
  \]
  Since \(\frac{1}{2^{m+1}}\) is a positive fraction, \(\frac{5}{2} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^{m+1}}\right)\) is less than \(\frac{5}{2}\).
  Thus, by induction, the statement holds for all positive integers \( n \).
