  We aim to show that for a positive integer \( n \), the product \( \left( \prod_{k=1}^{n} \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2^k} \right) \right) \) is less than \( \frac{5}{2} \). We proceed by induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case: \( n = 1 \)**
  For \( n = 1 \), the product is:
  \[ \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2^1} \right) = 1 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2} \]
  Clearly, \( \frac{3}{2} < \frac{5}{2} \).
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n = m \), i.e.,
  \[ \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2^m} \right) \cdot \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2^m} \right) < \frac{5}{2} \]
  We need to show it holds for \( n = m + 1 \):
  \[ \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2^{m+1}} \right) \cdot \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2^{m+1}} \right) < \frac{5}{2} \]
  First, express the product for \( n = m + 1 \):
  \[ \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2^{m+1}} \right) \cdot \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2^{m+1}} \right) = \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2^{m+1}} \right) \cdot \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2^{m+1}} \right) \]
  \[ = \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2^{m+1}} \right)^2 \]
  Using the inductive hypothesis:
  \[ \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2^{m+1}} \right)^2 < \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2^{m+1}} \right) \cdot \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2^{m+1}} \right) = \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2^{m+1}} \right)^2 \]
  Since \( \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2^{m+1}} \right)^2 \) is a product of two terms each less than 1, it is less than 1. Therefore, the product is less than \( \frac{5}{2} \).
