  We aim to show that for any positive integer \( n \), the product \( \prod_{k=1}^{n} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) \) is less than \( \frac{5}{2} \). We proceed by induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case:**
  For \( n = 1 \), the product is \( 1 + \frac{1}{2^1} = 1 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2} \), which is less than \( \frac{5}{2} \).
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n \). We need to show it holds for \( n + 1 \).
  The product for \( n + 1 \) can be written as:
  \[ \prod_{k=1}^{n+1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) = \left( \prod_{k=1}^{n} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) \right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^{n+1}}\right) \]
  By the inductive hypothesis, the product up to \( n \) is less than \( \frac{5}{2} \). We need to show that:
  \[ \left( \prod_{k=1}^{n} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) \right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^{n+1}}\right) < \frac{5}{2} \]
  Since \( \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^{n+1}}\right) \) is a positive number, we can use the fact that the product of two numbers less than \( \frac{5}{2} \) is still less than \( \frac{5}{2} \).
