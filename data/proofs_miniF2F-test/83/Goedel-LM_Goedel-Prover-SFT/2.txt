  We aim to show that for any positive integer \( n \), the product \( \prod_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) \) is less than \( \frac{5}{2} \). We proceed by induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case:**
  For \( n = 1 \), the product is \( \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^1}\right) = 1 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2} \), which is less than \( \frac{5}{2} \).
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n \), i.e., \( \prod_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) < \frac{5}{2} \). We need to show it holds for \( n + 1 \).
  Consider the product for \( n + 1 \):
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^{n+1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) = \left( \prod_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) \right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^{n+1}}\right)
  \]
  By the inductive hypothesis, this product is less than:
  \[
  \frac{5}{2} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^{n+1}}\right)
  \]
  We need to show that:
  \[
  \frac{5}{2} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^{n+1}}\right) < \frac{5}{2}
  \]
  Since \( \frac{1}{2^{n+1}} \) is a positive number, \( 1 + \frac{1}{2^{n+1}} \) is greater than 1, and thus:
  \[
  \frac{5}{2} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^{n+1}}\right) < \frac{5}{2}
  \]
