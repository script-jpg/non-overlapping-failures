  We need to show that for a positive integer \( n \), the product \( \prod_{k=1}^{n} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) \) is less than \( \frac{5}{2} \). This can be achieved by demonstrating that the product of the sequence \( \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) \) for \( k \) from 1 to \( n \) is strictly less than \( \frac{5}{2} \).

  -- Base case: when n = 1, the product is 1 + 1/2 = 3/2, which is less than 5/2.

  -- Inductive step: assume the statement holds for n, prove it for n + 1.
