  To show that for a positive integer \( n \), the product \( \prod_{k=1}^{n} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) \) is less than \( \frac{5}{2} \), we proceed by induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case:**
  For \( n = 1 \), the product is:
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^{1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) = 1 + \frac{1}{2^1} = 1 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2}
  \]
  Since \( \frac{3}{2} < \frac{5}{2} \), the base case holds.
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n = m \), i.e.,
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^{m} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) < \frac{5}{2}
  \]
  We need to show it holds for \( n = m + 1 \):
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^{m+1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) < \frac{5}{2}
  \]
  Using the inductive hypothesis, we have:
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^{m+1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) = \prod_{k=1}^{m} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^{m+1}}\right)
  \]
  By the inductive hypothesis, this product is less than \( \frac{5}{2} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^{m+1}}\right) \). We need to show:
  \[
  \frac{5}{2} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^{m+1}}\right) < \frac{5}{2}
  \]
  Since \( \frac{5}{2} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^{m+1}}\right) \) is always less than \( \frac{5}{2} \) because \( 1 + \frac{1}{2^{m+1}} < 2 \), the inductive step holds.
  Thus, by induction, the statement is true for all positive integers \( n \).
