  We need to show that for a positive integer \( n \), the product \( \prod_{k=1}^{n} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) \) is less than \( \frac{5}{2} \). We will use induction on \( n \) and some properties of finite products to establish this result.
  1. **Base Case**: When \( n = 1 \), the product is \( \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^1}\right) = 1 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2} \), which is less than \( \frac{5}{2} \).
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds for some \( n = m \), i.e., \( \prod_{k=1}^{m} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) < \frac{5}{2} \). We need to show it holds for \( n = m + 1 \).
     - The product for \( n = m + 1 \) can be written as:
       \[
       \prod_{k=1}^{m+1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) = \prod_{k=1}^{m} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^{m+1}}\right)
       \]
     - By the inductive hypothesis, the first part of the product is less than \( \frac{5}{2} \).
     - The second part, \( \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^{m+1}}\right) \), is less than 2.
     - Therefore, the entire product is less than:
       \[
       \frac{5}{2} \cdot 2 = 5
       \]
     - Since \( 5 < \frac{5}{2} \) is false, we need to adjust our reasoning. The correct approach is to consider the product of the sequence up to \( n = m + 1 \) and show it is less than \( \frac{5}{2} \).
