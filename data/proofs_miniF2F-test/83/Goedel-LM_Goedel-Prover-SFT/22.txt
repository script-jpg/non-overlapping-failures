  We aim to show that for a positive integer \( n \), the product \(\prod_{k=1}^{n} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right)\) is less than \(\frac{5}{2}\). We proceed by induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case: \( n = 1 \)**
  For \( n = 1 \), the product is:
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^{1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) = \left(1 + \frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{3}{2}
  \]
  Since \(\frac{3}{2} < \frac{5}{2}\), the base case holds.
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n = m \), i.e.,
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^{m} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) < \frac{5}{2}
  \]
  We need to show it holds for \( n = m + 1 \):
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^{m+1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) = \left(\prod_{k=1}^{m} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right)\right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^{m+1}}\right)
  \]
  By the inductive hypothesis, the product up to \( m \) is less than \(\frac{5}{2}\). We need to show:
  \[
  \left(\frac{5}{2}\right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^{m+1}}\right) < \frac{5}{2}
  \]
  Since \(\frac{1}{2^{m+1}}\) is a positive fraction, the product is less than \(\frac{5}{2}\). Thus, the inductive step holds.
  By induction, the statement is true for all positive integers \( n \).
