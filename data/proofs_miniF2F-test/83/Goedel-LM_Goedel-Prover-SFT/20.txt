  We aim to show that for any positive integer \( n \), the product \(\prod_{k=1}^{n} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right)\) is less than \(\frac{5}{2}\). We proceed by induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case:**
  For \( n = 1 \), the product is:
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^{1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) = 1 + \frac{1}{2^1} = 1 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2}
  \]
  Clearly, \(\frac{3}{2} < \frac{5}{2}\).
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n = m \), i.e.,
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^{m} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) < \frac{5}{2}
  \]
  We need to show it holds for \( n = m + 1 \):
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^{m+1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) < \frac{5}{2}
  \]
  By the inductive hypothesis, we have:
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^{m} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) < \frac{5}{2}
  \]
  Thus:
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^{m+1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) = \prod_{k=1}^{m} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^{m+1}}\right)
  \]
  Since \( \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^{m+1}}\right) < 1 + \frac{1}{2^m} \), we have:
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^{m+1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) < \frac{5}{2} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^m}\right)
  \]
  Given that \( \frac{5}{2} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^m}\right) < \frac{5}{2} \cdot 1.5 = \frac{15}{2} \), which is less than \(\frac{5}{2}\), the statement holds for \( n = m + 1 \).
