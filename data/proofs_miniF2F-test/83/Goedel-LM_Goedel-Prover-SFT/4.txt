  We aim to show that for any positive integer \( n \), the product \( \prod_{k=1}^{n} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) \) is less than \( \frac{5}{2} \). We will use induction on \( n \) and some properties of finite products to establish this result.
  1. **Base Case**: When \( n = 1 \), the product is \( 1 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2} \), which is indeed less than \( \frac{5}{2} \).
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds for some \( n \). We need to show it holds for \( n + 1 \).
     - For \( n = 1 \), the product is \( 1 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2} \), which is less than \( \frac{5}{2} \).
     - For \( n > 1 \), we can use the fact that \( \prod_{k=1}^{n+1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) = \prod_{k=1}^{n} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^{n+1}}\right) \). By the inductive hypothesis, the product up to \( n \) is less than \( \frac{5}{2} \). Adding the next term, we get:
       \[
       \prod_{k=1}^{n+1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) = \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^{n+1}}\right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) < \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^{n+1}}\right) \cdot \frac{5}{2}
       \]
       Since \( \frac{5}{2} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^{n+1}}\right) < \frac{5}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{2} = \frac{15}{4} \), which is less than \( \frac{5}{2} \), the product remains less than \( \frac{5}{2} \).
