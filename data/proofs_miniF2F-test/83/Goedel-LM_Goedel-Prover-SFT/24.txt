  We aim to show that for any positive integer \( n \), the product \( \prod_{k=1}^{n} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) \) is less than \( \frac{5}{2} \). We proceed by induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case:**
  For \( n = 1 \), the product is \( 1 + \frac{1}{2^1} = 1 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2} \), which is less than \( \frac{5}{2} \).
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n \). We need to show it holds for \( n + 1 \). The product for \( n + 1 \) can be written as:
  \[ \prod_{k=1}^{n+1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) = \left( \prod_{k=1}^{n} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) \right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^{n+1}}\right) \]
  By the inductive hypothesis, the product up to \( n \) is less than \( \frac{5}{2} \). We need to show that the new term \( \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^{n+1}}\right) \) does not exceed \( \frac{5}{2} \). Since \( 2^{n+1} \) is a power of 2, \( \frac{1}{2^{n+1}} \) is a small fraction, and thus:
  \[ 1 + \frac{1}{2^{n+1}} \leq 1 + \frac{1}{2^n} = 1 + \frac{1}{2^n} \]
  Given that \( \frac{1}{2^n} \) is a decreasing function of \( n \), and \( \frac{1}{2^n} \) is less than \( \frac{1}{2} \) for all \( n > 0 \), we have:
  \[ 1 + \frac{1}{2^n} < 1 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2} \]
  Thus, the product for \( n + 1 \) is less than \( \frac{3}{2} \), which is less than \( \frac{5}{2} \).
  By induction, the statement holds for all positive integers \( n \).
