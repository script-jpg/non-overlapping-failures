  We aim to show that for a positive integer \( n \), the product \(\prod_{k=1}^{n} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right)\) is less than \(\frac{5}{2}\). We proceed by induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case:**
  For \( n = 1 \), the product is \(\left(1 + \frac{1}{2^1}\right) = 1 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2}\). Clearly, \(\frac{3}{2} < \frac{5}{2}\).
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n \). We need to show it holds for \( n + 1 \).
  Consider the product for \( n + 1 \):
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^{n+1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) = \prod_{k=1}^{n} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^{n+1}}\right)
  \]
  By the inductive hypothesis, this product is less than \(\frac{5}{2} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^{n+1}}\right)\). We need to show that:
  \[
  \frac{5}{2} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^{n+1}}\right) < \frac{5}{2}
  \]
  This simplifies to:
  \[
  \frac{5}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2^{n+1}} < \frac{5}{2}
  \]
  Since \(\frac{1}{2^{n+1}}\) is a positive fraction, the left-hand side is indeed less than \(\frac{5}{2}\).
  Thus, by induction, the statement holds for all positive integers \( n \).
