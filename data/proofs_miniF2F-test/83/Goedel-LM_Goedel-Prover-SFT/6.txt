  We aim to show that for a positive integer \( n \), the product \( \prod_{k=1}^{n} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) \) is less than \( \frac{5}{2} \). We proceed by induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case: \( n = 1 \)**
  For \( n = 1 \), the product is:
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^{1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) = \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^1}\right) = 1 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2}
  \]
  Clearly, \( \frac{3}{2} < \frac{5}{2} \).
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n = m \), i.e.,
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^{m} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) < \frac{5}{2}
  \]
  We need to show it holds for \( n = m + 1 \):
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^{m+1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) < \frac{5}{2}
  \]
  Using the inductive hypothesis, we have:
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^{m+1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) = \left(\prod_{k=1}^{m} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right)\right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^{m+1}}\right)
  \]
  By the inductive hypothesis, the product up to \( m \) is less than \( \frac{5}{2} \), and:
  \[
  \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^{m+1}}\right) = \frac{3}{2}
  \]
  Thus, the product becomes:
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^{m+1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) < \frac{5}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{2} = \frac{15}{4}
  \]
  Since \( \frac{15}{4} < \frac{5}{2} \), the statement holds for \( n = m + 1 \).
  By induction, the statement is true for all \( n \).
