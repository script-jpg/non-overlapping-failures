  We aim to show that for any positive integer \( n \), the product \(\prod_{k=1}^{n} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) < \frac{5}{2}\). We will use induction on \( n \) and some properties of finite products to establish this result.
  1. **Base Case**: When \( n = 1 \), the product is \(\left(1 + \frac{1}{2^1}\right) = 1 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2}\), which is less than \(\frac{5}{2}\).
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds for some \( n = m \), i.e., \(\prod_{k=1}^{m} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) < \frac{5}{2}\). We need to show it holds for \( n = m + 1 \).
     - The product for \( n = m + 1 \) can be written as \(\prod_{k=1}^{m+1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) = \prod_{k=1}^{m} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^{m+1}}\right)\).
     - By the inductive hypothesis, \(\prod_{k=1}^{m} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) < \frac{5}{2}\).
     - We need to show that \(\left(1 + \frac{1}{2^{m+1}}\right) < \frac{5}{2}\).
     - Since \( m > 0 \), \( 2^{m+1} > 2^m \), and thus \( 1 + \frac{1}{2^{m+1}} > 1 + \frac{1}{2^m} \).
     - Given \( \frac{1}{2^m} < \frac{1}{2^{m+1}} \), we have \( 1 + \frac{1}{2^{m+1}} > 1 + \frac{1}{2^m} \).
     - Combining these, we get \(\left(1 + \frac{1}{2^{m+1}}\right) < \frac{5}{2}\).
  Thus, by induction, the statement holds for all positive integers \( n \).
