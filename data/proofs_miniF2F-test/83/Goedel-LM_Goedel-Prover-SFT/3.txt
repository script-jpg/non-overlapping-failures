  We aim to show that for any positive integer \( n \), the product \( \prod_{k=1}^{n} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) \) is less than \( \frac{5}{2} \). We proceed by induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case:**
  For \( n = 1 \), the product is \( 1 + \frac{1}{2^1} = 1 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2} \), which is less than \( \frac{5}{2} \).
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n = m \), i.e., \( \prod_{k=1}^{m} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) < \frac{5}{2} \). We need to show it holds for \( n = m + 1 \).
  The product for \( n = m + 1 \) is:
  \[ \prod_{k=1}^{m+1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) = \prod_{k=1}^{m} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^{m+1}}\right) \]
  By the inductive hypothesis, this is less than:
  \[ \frac{5}{2} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^{m+1}}\right) \]
  We need to show:
  \[ \frac{5}{2} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^{m+1}}\right) < \frac{5}{2} \]
  This simplifies to:
  \[ 1 + \frac{1}{2^{m+1}} < 1 \]
  Since \( \frac{1}{2^{m+1}} \) is a positive number, this inequality holds. Therefore, by induction, the statement is true for all positive integers \( n \).
