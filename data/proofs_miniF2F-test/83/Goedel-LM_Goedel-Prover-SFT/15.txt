  We aim to show that for any positive integer \( n \), the product \( \left( \prod_{k=1}^{n} \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2^k} \right) \right) \) is less than \( \frac{5}{2} \). We proceed by induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case: \( n = 1 \)**
  For \( n = 1 \), the product is:
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^{1} \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2^k} \right) = 1 + \frac{1}{2^1} = 1 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2}
  \]
  Since \( \frac{3}{2} < \frac{5}{2} \), the base case holds.
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n = m \), i.e.,
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^{m} \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2^k} \right) < \frac{5}{2}
  \]
  We need to show it holds for \( n = m + 1 \):
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^{m+1} \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2^k} \right) = \prod_{k=1}^{m} \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2^k} \right) \cdot \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2^{m+1}} \right)
  \]
  By the inductive hypothesis, the product up to \( m \) is less than \( \frac{5}{2} \). We need to show:
  \[
  \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2^{m+1}} \right) < \frac{5}{2}
  \]
  This is true because:
  \[
  1 + \frac{1}{2^{m+1}} < 1 + \frac{1}{2^m} < \frac{5}{2}
  \]
  Thus, the inductive step holds, completing the proof.
