  We aim to show that for a positive integer \( n \), the product \( \prod_{k=1}^{n} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) \) is less than \( \frac{5}{2} \). We will use induction on \( n \) and some properties of finite products to establish this result.
  1. **Base Case**: When \( n = 1 \), the product is simply \( 1 + \frac{1}{2^1} = 1 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2} \), which is less than \( \frac{5}{2} \).
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds for some \( n = m \), i.e., \( \prod_{k=1}^{m} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) < \frac{5}{2} \). We need to show it holds for \( n = m + 1 \).
     - The product for \( n = m + 1 \) can be written as:
       \[
       \prod_{k=1}^{m+1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) = \prod_{k=1}^{m} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^k}\right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{2^{m+1}}\right)
       \]
     - By the inductive hypothesis, the first part of the product is less than \( \frac{5}{2} \).
     - The second part is \( 1 + \frac{1}{2^{m+1}} \), which is less than \( 1 + \frac{1}{2^m} = \frac{3}{2} \).
     - Therefore, the entire product is less than \( \frac{5}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{2} = \frac{15}{4} \), which is less than \( \frac{5}{2} \).
  Thus, by induction, the statement holds for all positive integers \( n \).
