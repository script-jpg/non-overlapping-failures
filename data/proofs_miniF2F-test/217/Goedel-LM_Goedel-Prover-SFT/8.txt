  Given a point \((x, y)\) on the coordinate plane with both coordinates negative, it is a distance of 6 units from the \(x\)-axis. It is a distance of 15 units from the point \((8, 3)\). It is a distance \(\sqrt{n}\) from the origin. We need to show that \(n = 52\).
  1. From the condition that the point is a distance of 6 units from the \(x\)-axis, we have \(|y| = 6\). Since \(y\) is negative, \(y = -6\).
  2. Using the distance condition from the point \((8, 3)\), we have:
     \[
     \sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (y - 3)^2} = 15
     \]
     Substituting \(y = -6\) into the equation, we get:
     \[
     \sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (-6 - 3)^2} = 15 \implies \sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (-9)^2} = 15 \implies \sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + 81} = 15
     \]
  3. Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root, we obtain:
     \[
     (x - 8)^2 + 81 = 225
     \]
     Solving for \((x - 8)^2\), we get:
     \[
     (x - 8)^2 = 225 - 81 = 144
     \]
     Thus, \(x - 8 = \pm 12\). Since \(x\) is negative, \(x = 8 - 12 = -4\).
  4. Now, using the distance condition from the origin, we have:
     \[
     \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{n}
     \]
     Substituting \(x = -4\) and \(y = -6\), we get:
     \[
     \sqrt{(-4)^2 + (-6)^2} = \sqrt{n} \implies \sqrt{16 + 36} = \sqrt{n} \implies \sqrt{52} = \sqrt{n}
     \]
     Therefore, \(n = 52\).
