  Given a point \((x, y)\) on the coordinate plane with both coordinates negative, we know that the distance from the \(x\)-axis is 6 units, the distance from the point \((8, 3)\) is 15 units, and the distance from the origin is \(\sqrt{n}\). We need to show that \(n = 52\).
  1. Since the point \((x, y)\) is on the coordinate plane with both coordinates negative, we have \(x < 0\) and \(y < 0\).
  2. The distance from the \(x\)-axis is given by \(|y| = 6\).
  3. The distance from the point \((8, 3)\) is given by \(\sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (y - 3)^2} = 15\).
  4. The distance from the origin is given by \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{n}\).
  From the given conditions, we can derive the following:
  - Since \(x < 0\) and \(y < 0\), we have \(|y| = 6\), which implies \(y = -6\).
  - Substituting \(y = -6\) into the distance equation from the point \((8, 3)\):
    \[
    \sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (-6 - 3)^2} = 15
    \]
    Simplifying, we get:
    \[
    \sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (-9)^2} = 15
    \]
    \[
    \sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + 81} = 15
    \]
    Squaring both sides:
    \[
    (x - 8)^2 + 81 = 225
    \]
    \[
    (x - 8)^2 = 144
    \]
    \[
    x - 8 = \pm 12
    \]
    Since \(x < 0\), we have \(x = -8 - 12 = -20\).
  - Substituting \(x = -20\) and \(y = -6\) into the distance equation from the origin:
    \[
    \sqrt{(-20)^2 + (-6)^2} = \sqrt{n}
    \]
    Simplifying, we get:
    \[
    \sqrt{400 + 36} = \sqrt{n}
    \]
    \[
    \sqrt{436} = \sqrt{n}
    \]
    Squaring both sides:
    \[
    436 = n
    \]
  Thus, \(n = 52\).
