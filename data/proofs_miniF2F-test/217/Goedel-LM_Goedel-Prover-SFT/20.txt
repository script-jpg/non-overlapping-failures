  Given a point \((x, y)\) on the coordinate plane with both coordinates negative, it is a distance of 6 units from the x-axis. It is a distance of 15 units from the point \((8, 3)\). It is a distance \(\sqrt{n}\) from the origin. We need to determine \(n\).
  1. Since the point is a distance of 6 units from the x-axis, we have \(|y| = 6\).
  2. Since the point is a distance of 15 units from the point \((8, 3)\), we have \(\sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (y - 3)^2} = 15\).
  3. The distance from the origin to the point \((x, y)\) is \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\), which is given to be \(\sqrt{n}\).
  To find \(n\), we use the properties of distances and solve the equations step by step.
