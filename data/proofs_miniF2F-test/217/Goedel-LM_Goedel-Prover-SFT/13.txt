  Given a point \((x, y)\) on the coordinate plane with both coordinates negative, we know that the distance from the point to the \(x\)-axis is 6 units, and the distance from the point to the point \((8, 3)\) is 15 units. We need to find \(n\) such that the distance from the point to the origin is \(\sqrt{n}\), and show that \(n = 52\).
  1. Since the point is on the coordinate plane with both coordinates negative, the \(x\)-coordinate and \(y\)-coordinate are both negative.
  2. The distance from the point \((x, y)\) to the \(x\)-axis is given by \(|y| = 6\).
  3. The distance from the point \((x, y)\) to the point \((8, 3)\) is given by \(\sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (y - 3)^2} = 15\).
  4. The distance from the point \((x, y)\) to the origin is given by \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{n}\).
  To solve for \(n\), we use the given distances and properties of the coordinate plane.
