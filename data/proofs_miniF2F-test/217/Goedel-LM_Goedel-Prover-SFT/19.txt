  Given a point \((x, y)\) on the coordinate plane with both coordinates negative, we need to show that it is a distance of 6 units from the x-axis. Additionally, it is a distance of 15 units from the point \((8, 3)\). We are also given that the distance from the origin is \(\sqrt{n}\). We need to find \(n\).
  1. Since \(x\) and \(y\) are negative, the absolute value of \(y\) is given as 6 units.
  2. The distance from the point \((8, 3)\) to \((x, y)\) is 15 units.
  3. The distance from the origin to the point \((x, y)\) is \(\sqrt{n}\).
  We can set up the following equations based on the distances:
  \[
  \sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (y - 3)^2} = 15
  \]
  \[
  \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{n}
  \]
  By squaring both sides of the first equation:
  \[
  (x - 8)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 225
  \]
  By squaring both sides of the second equation:
  \[
  x^2 + y^2 = n
  \]
  We need to find \(n\). Using the given absolute value of \(y\) (which is -6, since \(x\) and \(y\) are negative), we can solve for \(n\).
