  Given a point \((x, y)\) on the coordinate plane with both coordinates negative, we know that \(|y| = 6\) and the distance from the point \((x, y)\) to the \(x\)-axis is 6 units. Additionally, the distance from the point \((x, y)\) to the point \((8, 3)\) is 15 units, and the distance from the origin to the point \((x, y)\) is \(\sqrt{n}\). We need to show that \(n = 52\).
  1. Since \(|y| = 6\), \(y\) must be either 6 or -6.
  2. Given the distances, we can set up equations using the Pythagorean theorem:
     - For the distance from \((x, y)\) to the \(x\)-axis: \(|y| = 6\)
     - For the distance from \((x, y)\) to \((8, 3)\): \(\sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (y - 3)^2} = 15\)
     - For the distance from the origin to \((x, y)\): \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{n}\)
  3. Substituting \(y = -6\) (since \(y < 0\)) into the equations, we get:
     - \(\sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (-6 - 3)^2} = 15\) simplifies to \(\sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + 81} = 15\)
     - \(\sqrt{x^2 + (-6)^2} = \sqrt{n}\) simplifies to \(\sqrt{x^2 + 36} = \sqrt{n}\)
  4. Solving \(\sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + 81} = 15\):
     - \((x - 8)^2 + 81 = 225\)
     - \((x - 8)^2 = 144\)
     - \(x - 8 = \pm 12\)
     - \(x = 20\) or \(x = -4\)
  5. Solving \(\sqrt{x^2 + 36} = \sqrt{n}\):
     - \(x^2 + 36 = n\)
  6. For \(x = 20\):
     - \(20^2 + 36 = 400 + 36 = 436\)
  7. For \(x = -4\):
     - \((-4)^2 + 36 = 16 + 36 = 52\)
  8. Therefore, \(n = 52\).
