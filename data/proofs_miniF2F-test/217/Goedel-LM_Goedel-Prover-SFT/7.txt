  Given a point \((x, y)\) on the coordinate plane with both coordinates negative, it is a distance of 6 units from the \(x\)-axis. It is a distance of 15 units from the point \((8, 3)\). It is a distance \(\sqrt{n}\) from the origin. We need to find \(n\).
  1. Since \(x\) and \(y\) are negative, \(y\) is between 0 and 6 units, implying \(y = -6\) because \(|y| = 6\).
  2. Substituting \(y = -6\) into the distance formula from the \(x\)-axis, we get \(| -6 | = 6\), which is consistent with the given condition.
  3. Using the distance formula from the point \((8, 3)\), we substitute \(x\) and \(y\) into the formula:
     \[
     \sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (y - 3)^2} = 15
     \]
     Substituting \(y = -6\), we get:
     \[
     \sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (-6 - 3)^2} = 15 \implies \sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (-9)^2} = 15
     \]
  4. Simplifying the equation:
     \[
     \sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + 81} = 15 \implies (x - 8)^2 + 81 = 225 \implies (x - 8)^2 = 144
     \]
  5. Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     x - 8 = \pm 12 \implies x = 20 \text{ or } x = -4
     \]
  6. Since \(x\) is negative, \(x = -4\).
  7. Substituting \(x = -4\) and \(y = -6\) into the distance formula from the origin:
     \[
     \sqrt{(-4)^2 + (-6)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 36} = \sqrt{52}
     \]
  8. Therefore, \(n = 52\).
