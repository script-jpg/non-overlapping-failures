  Given a point \((x, y)\) on the coordinate plane with both coordinates negative, we know that it is a distance of 6 units from the \(x\)-axis. Additionally, it is a distance of 15 units from the point \((8, 3)\). We need to find the value of \(n\) such that the distance from the origin to the point \((x, y)\) is \(\sqrt{n}\).
  1. Since the point \((x, y)\) is on the coordinate plane with both coordinates negative, we have \(x < 0\) and \(y < 0\).
  2. The distance from the \(x\)-axis to the point \((x, y)\) is given by \(|y|\). Given \(|y| = 6\), we have \(y = -6\) because \(y < 0\).
  3. The distance from the point \((8, 3)\) to the point \((x, y)\) is given by \(\sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (y - 3)^2} = 15\).
  4. Substituting \(y = -6\) into the distance equation, we get \(\sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (-6 - 3)^2} = 15\).
  5. Simplifying the equation, we have \(\sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (-9)^2} = 15\).
  6. Squaring both sides, we get \((x - 8)^2 + 81 = 225\).
  7. Solving for \((x - 8)^2\), we get \((x - 8)^2 = 144\).
  8. Taking the square root of both sides, we find \(x - 8 = \pm 12\).
  9. Since \(x < 0\), we have \(x = 8 - 12 = -4\).
  10. Substituting \(x = -4\) and \(y = -6\) into the distance from the origin, we get \(\sqrt{(-4)^2 + (-6)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 36} = \sqrt{52} = \sqrt{n}\).
  11. Therefore, \(n = 52\).
