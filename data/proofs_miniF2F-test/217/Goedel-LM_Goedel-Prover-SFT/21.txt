  Given a point \((x, y)\) on the coordinate plane with both coordinates negative, we know that the distance from the \(x\)-axis is 6 units, and the distance from the point \((8, 3)\) is 15 units. We need to find \(n\) such that the distance from the origin is \(\sqrt{n}\).
  1. Since \(x\) and \(y\) are negative, the distance from the \(x\)-axis is \(|y| = 6\), so \(y = -6\).
  2. The distance from the point \((8, 3)\) to \((x, y)\) is given by \(\sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (y - 3)^2} = 15\).
  3. Substituting \(y = -6\) into the equation, we get \(\sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (-6 - 3)^2} = 15\), which simplifies to \(\sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (-9)^2} = 15\).
  4. Squaring both sides, we obtain \((x - 8)^2 + 81 = 225\).
  5. Solving for \((x - 8)^2\), we find \((x - 8)^2 = 225 - 81 = 144\).
  6. Therefore, \(x - 8 = \pm 12\).
  7. Since \(x\) is negative, \(x - 8 = -12\), so \(x = -12 + 8 = -4\).
  8. The distance from the origin is \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{(-4)^2 + (-6)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 36} = \sqrt{52}\).
  Thus, \(n = 52\).
