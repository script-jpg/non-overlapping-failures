  Given a point \((x, y)\) on the coordinate plane with both coordinates negative, we know:
  1. The distance from the \(x\)-axis is 6 units, which implies \(|y| = 6\).
  2. The distance from the point \((8, 3)\) is 15 units, which implies \(\sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (y - 3)^2} = 15\).
  3. The distance from the origin is \(\sqrt{n}\).
  We need to find \(n\).
  First, we note that since \(x\) and \(y\) are negative, \(y = -6\).
  Substituting \(y = -6\) into the distance equation from the point \((8, 3)\):
  \[
  \sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (-6 - 3)^2} = 15
  \]
  \[
  \sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (-9)^2} = 15
  \]
  \[
  \sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + 81} = 15
  \]
  Squaring both sides:
  \[
  (x - 8)^2 + 81 = 225
  \]
  \[
  (x - 8)^2 = 144
  \]
  \[
  x - 8 = \pm 12
  \]
  Since \(x < 0\), we have \(x - 8 = -12\).
  \[
  x = -4
  \]
  Now, substituting \(x = -4\) and \(y = -6\) into the distance equation from the origin:
  \[
  \sqrt{(-4)^2 + (-6)^2} = \sqrt{n}
  \]
  \[
  \sqrt{16 + 36} = \sqrt{n}
  \]
  \[
  \sqrt{52} = \sqrt{n}
  \]
  \[
  n = 52
  \]
