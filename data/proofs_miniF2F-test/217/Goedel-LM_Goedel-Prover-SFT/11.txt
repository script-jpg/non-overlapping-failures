  Given a point \((x, y)\) on the coordinate plane with both coordinates negative, we know that the distance from the point to the \(x\)-axis is 6 units. The point is also a distance of 15 units from the point \((8, 3)\) and a distance \(\sqrt{n}\) from the origin. We need to show that \(n = 52\).
  1. Since both \(x\) and \(y\) are negative, we have \(y = -6\) because the distance from the point to the \(x\)-axis is 6 units.
  2. Substituting \(y = -6\) into the distance equation from the point \((8, 3)\), we get:
     \[
     \sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (-6 - 3)^2} = 15
     \]
     Simplifying inside the square root, we have:
     \[
     \sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (-9)^2} = 15 \implies \sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + 81} = 15
     \]
  3. Squaring both sides, we obtain:
     \[
     (x - 8)^2 + 81 = 225
     \]
     Solving for \(x\), we get:
     \[
     (x - 8)^2 = 144 \implies x - 8 = \pm 12
     \]
     Since \(x\) is negative, we have \(x = 8 - 12 = -4\).
  4. Substituting \(x = -4\) and \(y = -6\) into the distance equation from the origin, we get:
     \[
     \sqrt{(-4)^2 + (-6)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 36} = \sqrt{52}
     \]
  5. Therefore, \(n = 52\).
