  Given a point \((x, y)\) on the coordinate plane with both coordinates negative, we need to show that it is a distance of 6 units from the \(x\)-axis. Additionally, it is a distance of 15 units from the point \((8, 3)\). We are also given that the distance from the origin to the point \((x, y)\) is \(\sqrt{n}\), where \(n\) is a natural number and we need to determine \(n\).
  1. From the condition \(|y| = 6\), we deduce that \(y = -6\) because \(y\) is negative.
  2. Using the distance formula, we have:
     \[
     \sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (y - 3)^2} = 15
     \]
     Substituting \(y = -6\) into the equation, we get:
     \[
     \sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (-6 - 3)^2} = 15
     \]
     Simplifying inside the square root:
     \[
     \sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (-9)^2} = 15
     \]
     \[
     \sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + 81} = 15
     \]
     Squaring both sides:
     \[
     (x - 8)^2 + 81 = 225
     \]
     \[
     (x - 8)^2 = 144
     \]
     \[
     x - 8 = \pm 12
     \]
     Since \(x\) is negative, we have \(x - 8 = -12\), so:
     \[
     x = -4
     \]
  3. Now, we need to find \(n\) such that:
     \[
     \sqrt{(-4)^2 + (-6)^2} = \sqrt{n}
     \]
     Simplifying inside the square root:
     \[
     \sqrt{16 + 36} = \sqrt{n}
     \]
     \[
     \sqrt{52} = \sqrt{n}
     \]
     Therefore, \(n = 52\).
