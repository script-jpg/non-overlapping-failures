  Given a point \((x, y)\) on the coordinate plane with both coordinates negative, we know that the distance from the \(x\)-axis is 6 units, and the distance from the point \((8, 3)\) is 15 units. We also know that the distance from the origin is \(\sqrt{n}\). We need to show that \(n = 52\).
  1. Since both \(x\) and \(y\) are negative, we have \(y = -6\).
  2. Using the distance formula from the point \((8, 3)\) to \((x, y)\), we get:
     \[
     \sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (y - 3)^2} = 15
     \]
  3. Substituting \(y = -6\) into the equation, we obtain:
     \[
     \sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (-6 - 3)^2} = 15
     \]
  4. Simplifying further, we have:
     \[
     \sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (-9)^2} = 15
     \]
  5. Squaring both sides, we get:
     \[
     (x - 8)^2 + 81 = 225
     \]
  6. Solving for \((x - 8)^2\), we find:
     \[
     (x - 8)^2 = 225 - 81 = 144
     \]
  7. Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
     \[
     x - 8 = \pm 12
     \]
  8. Since \(x\) is negative, we have:
     \[
     x = 8 - 12 = -4
     \]
  9. Substituting \(x = -4\) and \(y = -6\) into the equation \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{n}\), we get:
     \[
     \sqrt{(-4)^2 + (-6)^2} = \sqrt{n}
     \]
  10. Simplifying, we have:
      \[
      \sqrt{16 + 36} = \sqrt{n}
      \]
  11. Further simplifying, we get:
      \[
      \sqrt{52} = \sqrt{n}
      \]
  12. Since the square root function is injective, we conclude:
      \[
      n = 52
      \]
