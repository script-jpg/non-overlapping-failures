  Given a point \((x, y)\) on the coordinate plane with both coordinates negative, it is a distance of 6 units from the \(x\)-axis. It is a distance of 15 units from the point \((8, 3)\). It is a distance \(\sqrt{n}\) from the origin. We need to determine \(n\).
  1. Since the point \((x, y)\) is on the coordinate plane and both coordinates are negative, the distance from the \(x\)-axis is given by \(|y| = 6\).
  2. The distance from the point \((8, 3)\) is given by \(\sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (y - 3)^2} = 15\).
  3. The distance from the origin is given by \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{n}\).
  From the given conditions, we can derive:
  - Since \(|y| = 6\), \(y = -6\) (as \(y\) is negative).
  - Substituting \(y = -6\) into the distance equation from the point \((8, 3)\), we get:
    \[
    \sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (-6 - 3)^2} = 15
    \]
    Simplifying, we have:
    \[
    \sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (-9)^2} = 15
    \]
    \[
    \sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + 81} = 15
    \]
    Squaring both sides, we get:
    \[
    (x - 8)^2 + 81 = 225
    \]
    \[
    (x - 8)^2 = 144
    \]
    \[
    x - 8 = \pm 12
    \]
    Since \(x\) is negative, \(x = -4\).
  - Substituting \(x = -4\) and \(y = -6\) into the distance equation from the origin, we get:
    \[
    \sqrt{(-4)^2 + (-6)^2} = \sqrt{n}
    \]
    \[
    \sqrt{16 + 36} = \sqrt{n}
    \]
    \[
    \sqrt{52} = \sqrt{n}
    \]
    \[
    n = 52
    \]
