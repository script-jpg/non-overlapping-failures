  Given a point \((x, y)\) on the coordinate plane with both coordinates negative, we know that the distance from the \(x\)-axis is 6 units, and the distance from the point \((8, 3)\) is 15 units. We also know that the distance from the origin \((0, 0)\) is \(\sqrt{n}\). We need to find \(n\).
  First, we use the given conditions to set up equations:
  1. \(\lvert y \rvert = 6\) implies \(y = -6\) because \(y\) is negative.
  2. \(\sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (y - 3)^2} = 15\)
  3. \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{n}\)
  From the second equation, we square both sides to get:
  \[
  (x - 8)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 225
  \]
  Substituting \(y = -6\) into the equation:
  \[
  (x - 8)^2 + (-6 - 3)^2 = 225
  \]
  Simplifying the equation:
  \[
  (x - 8)^2 + (-9)^2 = 225
  \]
  \[
  (x - 8)^2 + 81 = 225
  \]
  \[
  (x - 8)^2 = 144
  \]
  \[
  x - 8 = \pm 12
  \]
  Since \(x\) is negative, we have:
  \[
  x = 8 - 12 = -4
  \]
  Now, substituting \(x = -4\) and \(y = -6\) into the third equation:
  \[
  \sqrt{(-4)^2 + (-6)^2} = \sqrt{n}
  \]
  \[
  \sqrt{16 + 36} = \sqrt{n}
  \]
  \[
  \sqrt{52} = \sqrt{n}
  \]
  Since \(\sqrt{52} = \sqrt{26 \times 2}\), we have:
  \[
  \sqrt{n} = \sqrt{26 \times 2}
  \]
  Thus, \(n = 52\).
