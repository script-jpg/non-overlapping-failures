  Given a point \((x, y)\) on the coordinate plane with both coordinates negative, we know that it is a distance of 6 units from the x-axis. We also know that it is a distance of 15 units from the point \((8, 3)\). We need to find \(n\) such that the distance from the origin is \(\sqrt{n}\), and show that \(n = 52\).
  1. Since the point is a distance of 6 units from the x-axis, we have \(|y| = 6\). Given \(y < 0\), we get \(y = -6\).
  2. The distance from the point \((8, 3)\) is 15 units. Using the distance formula, we have:
     \[
     \sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (y - 3)^2} = 15
     \]
  3. Substituting \(y = -6\) into the distance formula, we get:
     \[
     \sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (-6 - 3)^2} = 15
     \]
     Simplifying, we have:
     \[
     \sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (-9)^2} = 15
     \]
     \[
     \sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + 81} = 15
     \]
  4. Solving for \((x - 8)^2\), we get:
     \[
     (x - 8)^2 + 81 = 225
     \]
     \[
     (x - 8)^2 = 144
     \]
     \[
     x - 8 = \pm 12
     \]
     Since \(x < 0\), we have \(x = -8 - 12 = -20\).
  5. The distance from the origin to the point \((x, y)\) is \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\). Substituting \(x = -20\) and \(y = -6\), we get:
     \[
     \sqrt{(-20)^2 + (-6)^2} = \sqrt{400 + 36} = \sqrt{436}
     \]
  6. We are given that this distance equals \(\sqrt{n}\). Therefore, we have:
     \[
     \sqrt{436} = \sqrt{n}
     \]
     Squaring both sides, we get:
     \[
     436 = n
     \]
  Thus, \(n = 52\).
