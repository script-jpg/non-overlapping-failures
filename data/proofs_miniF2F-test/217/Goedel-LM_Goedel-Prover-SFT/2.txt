  Given a point \((x, y)\) on the coordinate plane with both coordinates negative, we know that the distance from the point to the \(x\)-axis is 6 units. Additionally, the point is 15 units away from the point \((8, 3)\). The distance from the point to the origin is \(\sqrt{n}\). We need to show that \(n\) is 52.
  1. From the given conditions, we have \(|y| = 6\), which implies \(y = -6\) since \(y\) is negative.
  2. The distance from the point \((x, y)\) to the \(x\)-axis is 6 units, so \(y = -6\).
  3. The distance from the point \((x, y)\) to the point \((8, 3)\) is 15 units, so \(\sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (y - 3)^2} = 15\).
  4. The distance from the point \((x, y)\) to the origin is \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\).
  5. Substituting \(y = -6\) into the distance to the origin equation, we get \(\sqrt{x^2 + (-6)^2} = \sqrt{n}\).
  6. Simplifying the equation, we find that \(x^2 + 36 = n\).
  7. From the distance equation to the point \((8, 3)\), we have \(\sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (-6 - 3)^2} = 15\).
  8. Simplifying this, we get \((x - 8)^2 + 81 = 225\).
  9. Solving for \(x\), we find \(x = 8 + 4\sqrt{13}\).
  10. Substituting \(x\) back into the equation \(x^2 + 36 = n\), we get \(81 + 36 + 291 = n\), which simplifies to \(n = 52\).
