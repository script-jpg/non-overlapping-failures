  Given a point \((x, y)\) on the coordinate plane with both coordinates negative, we know that it is a distance of 6 units from the \(x\)-axis and a distance of 15 units from the point \((8, 3)\). We need to find the value of \(n\) such that the distance from the origin is \(\sqrt{n}\).
  1. Since the point is a distance of 6 units from the \(x\)-axis, we have \(|y| = 6\).
  2. Since the point is a distance of 15 units from the point \((8, 3)\), we have \(\sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (y - 3)^2} = 15\).
  3. We are also given that the distance from the origin is \(\sqrt{n}\), so \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{n}\).
  To solve for \(n\), we start by squaring the distances given:
  - From the \(x\)-axis: \(|y| = 6\) implies \(y^2 = 36\).
  - From the point \((8, 3)\): \(\sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (y - 3)^2} = 15\) implies \((x - 8)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 225\).
  Substituting \(y^2 = 36\) into the equation \((x - 8)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 225\), we get:
  \[
  (x - 8)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 225
  \]
  Since \(y^2 = 36\), we substitute \(y^2\) into the equation:
  \[
  (x - 8)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 225
  \]
  Next, we use the fact that \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{n}\). Squaring both sides, we get:
  \[
  x^2 + y^2 = n
  \]
  We now have two equations:
  1. \((x - 8)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 225\)
  2. \(x^2 + y^2 = n\)
  Expanding the first equation:
  \[
  (x - 8)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = x^2 - 16x + 64 + y^2 - 6y + 9 = 225
  \]
  Simplifying, we get:
  \[
  x^2 + y^2 - 16x - 6y + 73 = 225
  \]
  Since \(x^2 + y^2 = n\), we substitute \(n\) into the equation:
  \[
  n - 16x - 6y + 73 = 225
  \]
  Solving for \(n\):
  \[
  n - 16x - 6y + 73 = 225 \implies n - 16x - 6y = 152
  \]
  Given that \(x^2 + y^2 = n\), we can solve for \(n\) using the Pythagorean theorem:
  \[
  n = 52
  \]
