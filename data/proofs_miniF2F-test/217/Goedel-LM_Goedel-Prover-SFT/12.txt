  Given a point \((x, y)\) on the coordinate plane with both coordinates negative, we know that the distance from this point to the \(x\)-axis is 6 units. Additionally, the point is a distance of 15 units from the point \((8, 3)\). We need to determine the value of \(n\) such that the distance from the point to the origin is \(\sqrt{n}\).
  1. From the condition \(|y| = 6\), we deduce that \(y = -6\) because \(y\) is negative.
  2. Substituting \(y = -6\) into the equation for the distance from the point \((x, y)\) to the \(x\)-axis, we get \(|(-6)| = 6\).
  3. Using the given distance condition to \((8, 3)\), we substitute \(y = -6\) into the distance formula:
     \[
     \sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (-6 - 3)^2} = 15
     \]
  4. Simplifying the equation inside the square root:
     \[
     \sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (-9)^2} = 15
     \]
     \[
     \sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + 81} = 15
     \]
  5. Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root:
     \[
     (x - 8)^2 + 81 = 225
     \]
  6. Solving for \((x - 8)^2\):
     \[
     (x - 8)^2 = 225 - 81
     \]
     \[
     (x - 8)^2 = 144
     \]
  7. Taking the square root of both sides:
     \[
     x - 8 = \pm 12
     \]
  8. Since \(x\) is negative, we take the negative root:
     \[
     x - 8 = -12 \implies x = -4
     \]
  9. Now, we use the distance condition to the origin:
     \[
     \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{(-4)^2 + (-6)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 36} = \sqrt{52}
     \]
  10. Therefore, \(n = 52\).
