  Given a point \((x, y)\) on the coordinate plane with both coordinates negative, we know it is a distance of 6 units from the \(x\)-axis. Additionally, it is a distance of 15 units from the point \((8, 3)\). Finally, it is a distance \(\sqrt{n}\) from the origin. We need to determine the value of \(n\).
  1. Since the point \((x, y)\) is on the coordinate plane with both coordinates negative, the absolute value of the \(y\)-coordinate is 6, so \(y = -6\).
  2. The distance from the point \((x, y)\) to the point \((8, 3)\) is 15 units. Using the distance formula, we have:
     \[
     \sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (y - 3)^2} = 15
     \]
  3. Substituting \(y = -6\) into the distance formula, we get:
     \[
     \sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (-6 - 3)^2} = 15 \implies \sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + (-9)^2} = 15 \implies \sqrt{(x - 8)^2 + 81} = 15
     \]
  4. Solving for \((x - 8)^2\), we square both sides:
     \[
     (x - 8)^2 + 81 = 225 \implies (x - 8)^2 = 144
     \]
  5. Taking the square root of both sides, we find:
     \[
     x - 8 = \pm 12
     \]
  6. Since \(x\) is negative, we choose \(x - 8 = -12\), so \(x = -4\).
  7. The distance from the origin to the point \((-4, -6)\) is:
     \[
     \sqrt{(-4)^2 + (-6)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 36} = \sqrt{52}
     \]
  8. Therefore, \(n = 52\).
