-- We want to calculate $\sqrt{60x} \cdot \sqrt{12x} \cdot \sqrt{63x}$ and express it in simplest radical form in terms of $x$.

  -- First, we'll simplify each square root term individually.

  -- $\sqrt{60x} = \sqrt{60} \cdot \sqrt{x} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 15} \cdot \sqrt{x} = 2\sqrt{15} \cdot \sqrt{x}$

      _ = √(2^2) * √(15 * x) := by rw [Real.sqrt_mul (by norm_num)]
      _ = 2 * √(15 * x) := by rw [Real.sqrt_sq (by norm_num)]
      _ = 2 * √15 * √x := by rw [Real.sqrt_mul (by norm_num)]

  -- $\sqrt{12x} = \sqrt{12} \cdot \sqrt{x} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 3} \cdot \sqrt{x} = 2\sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{x}$
  have h2 : √(12 * x) = 2 * √3 * √x := by
    calc
      √(12 * x) = √(2^2 * 3 * x) := by norm_num
      _ = √(2^2) * √(3 * x) := by rw [Real.sqrt_mul (by norm_num)]
      _ = 2 * √(3 * x) := by rw [Real.sqrt_sq (by norm_num)]
      _ = 2 * √3 * √x := by rw [Real.sqrt_mul (by norm_num)]

  -- $\sqrt{63x} = \sqrt{63} \cdot \sqrt{x} = \sqrt{9 \cdot 7} \cdot \sqrt{x} = 3\sqrt{7} \cdot \sqrt{x}$
  have h3 : √(63 * x) = 3 * √7 * √x := by

      _ = 3 * √(7 * x) := by rw [Real.sqrt_sq (by norm_num)]
      _ = 3 * √7 * √x := by rw [Real.sqrt_mul (by norm_num)]
