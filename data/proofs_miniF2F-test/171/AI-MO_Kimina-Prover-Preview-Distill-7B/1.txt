  --   We then use the fact that $\sqrt{a^2} = a$ when $a \ge 0$.
  rw [mul_comm, ← pow_two, Real.sqrt_sq]

  --   Finally, we use the fact that $\sqrt{35x \cdot x^2} = \sqrt{35x} \cdot \sqrt{x^2} = \sqrt{35x} \cdot x$ since $x \ge 0$.
  rw [mul_comm, mul_assoc, Real.sqrt_mul, Real.sqrt_sq]

  --   Note: The above steps assume $x \ge 0$ because the square root function is only defined for non-negative numbers.
  --   Since $x$ is a NNReal, it is non-negative, so all the square roots are well-defined.
