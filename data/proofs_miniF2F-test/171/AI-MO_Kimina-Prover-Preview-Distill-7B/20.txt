-- Calculate $\sqrt{60x} \cdot \sqrt{12x} \cdot \sqrt{63x}$. Express your answer in simplest radical form in terms of $x$.
  -- Note: When entering a square root with more than one character, you must use parentheses or brackets.  For example, you should enter $\sqrt{14}$ as "sqrt(14)" or "sqrt{14}". Show that it is 36x \sqrt{35x}.
