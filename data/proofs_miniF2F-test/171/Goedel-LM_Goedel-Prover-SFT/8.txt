  To solve the problem of calculating \(\sqrt{60x} \cdot \sqrt{12x} \cdot \sqrt{63x}\) and expressing it in the simplest radical form, we proceed as follows:
  1. Use the property of square roots to combine the products inside the square roots.
  2. Simplify the combined expression using properties of square roots and multiplication.
  3. Verify that the simplified expression matches the desired form \(36x \sqrt{35x}\).
