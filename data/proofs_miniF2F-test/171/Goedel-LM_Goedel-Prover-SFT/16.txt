  To solve the problem of calculating \(\sqrt{60x} \cdot \sqrt{12x} \cdot \sqrt{63x}\) and simplifying it in the form \(36x \sqrt{35x}\), we proceed as follows:
  1. Use the property of square roots that \(\sqrt{a} \cdot \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{a \cdot b}\).
  2. Combine the terms inside the square roots.
  3. Simplify the combined expression.
  4. Verify that the simplified expression matches the desired form \(36x \sqrt{35x}\).
