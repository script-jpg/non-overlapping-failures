  To solve the problem of calculating \(\sqrt{60x} \cdot \sqrt{12x} \cdot \sqrt{63x}\) and showing that it equals \(36x \sqrt{35x}\) in simplest radical form, we proceed as follows:
  1. Use the property of square roots to combine the products under a single square root.
  2. Simplify the expression inside the square root.
  3. Verify that the simplified expression matches the target form.
