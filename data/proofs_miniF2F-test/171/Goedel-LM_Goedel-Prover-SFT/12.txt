  -- Rewrite the product of square roots as a square root of a product.
  -- This step simplifies the left-hand side to a single square root of a product.
  ring_nf
  -- Expand the product inside the square root and simplify the expression.
  field_simp
  -- Simplify the expression further by clearing denominators.
  ring_nf
  -- Finalize the simplification by expanding and simplifying the expression.
