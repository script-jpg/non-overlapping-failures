rw [← Real.sqrt_mul (by positivity)]
  -- Combine the expressions under a single square root.
  -- We need to show that (60 * x) * (12 * x) * (63 * x) = 36 * x * (35 * x)
  rw [mul_assoc]
  -- Rewrite the expression to prepare for simplifying the square root.
  norm_num
  -- Simplify the numerical constants.
  ring
  -- Simplify the algebraic expressions.
  rw [Real.sqrt_eq_iff_mul_self_eq] <;> norm_num <;> ring_nf <;> norm_num
  -- Verify that the expressions are equal by simplifying the square root.
