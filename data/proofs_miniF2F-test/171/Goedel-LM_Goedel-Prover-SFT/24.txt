  To solve the problem of calculating \(\sqrt{60x} \cdot \sqrt{12x} \cdot \sqrt{63x}\) and expressing it in the simplest radical form, we proceed as follows:
  1. Use the property of square roots to combine the products under a single square root.
  2. Simplify the combined expression.
  3. Verify that the simplified expression matches the desired result.
  -/
  -- Combine the products under a single square root using the property of square roots.
  rw [← Real.sqrt_mul (by positivity), ← Real.sqrt_mul (by positivity)]
  -- Simplify the combined expression using numerical normalization.
  norm_num
  -- Further simplify the expression to match the desired form.
  ring_nf
  -- Use the property of square roots to confirm the equality.
  rw [Real.sqrt_eq_iff_mul_self_eq] <;> norm_num <;>
    -- Verify the numerical values and ensure the equality holds.
    ring_nf <;>
      -- Final numerical normalization to confirm the equality.
      norm_num <;>
        -- Use linear arithmetic to confirm the equality.
