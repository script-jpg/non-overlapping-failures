The proof is direct. We substitute $x=2$ into the given function definition to get $f(2) = c \cdot 2^3 - 9 \cdot 2 + 3 = 8c - 18 + 3 = 8c - 15$. Given $f(2) = 9$, we have $8c - 15 = 9$, which simplifies to $8c = 24$ and thus $c = 3$.

The Lean 4 proof reflects this computation precisely:
1. We specialize the hypothesis h₀ at x = 2 to get the equation for f(2).
2. We rewrite f(2) in h₁ using this equation.
3. The resulting equation is 8c - 15 = 9, which is solved by linarith to give c = 3.

Therefore, the value of c is 3.
