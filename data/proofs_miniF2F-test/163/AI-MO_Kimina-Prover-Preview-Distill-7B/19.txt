/- Given $f(x)=cx^3-9x+3$ and $f(2)=9$, find the value of $c$. -/
  -- By substituting $x=2$ into $f(x)$, we get $f(2)=c⋅2^3-9⋅2+3$.
  have h₂ : f 2 = c * 2 ^ 3 - 9 * 2 + 3 := h₀ 2
  -- Since we also know that $f(2)=9$, we can set up the equation $c⋅2^3-9⋅2+3=9$.
  rw [h₂] at h₁
  -- Simplifying this equation: $c⋅8-18+3=9$.
  -- Which becomes $8c-15=9$.
  -- Solving for $c$, we get $8c=24$.
  -- Therefore, $c=3$.
