The problem provides us with a function $f(x) = cx^3 - 9x + 3$ and tells us that $f(2) = 9$. We need to find the value of $c$.

Let's calculate $f(2)$ using the given formula:
- $f(2) = c \cdot 2^3 - 9 \cdot 2 + 3$
- $= c \cdot 8 - 18 + 3$
- $= 8c - 15$

We know $f(2) = 9$, so we set up the equation $8c - 15 = 9$.

Solving for $c$:
- $8c - 15 = 9$
- $8c = 9 + 15$
- $8c = 24$
- $c = 24 / 8$
- $c = 3$

Therefore, $c = 3$.

The Lean proof proceeds by:
1. Using the function definition to calculate $f(2)$
2. Substituting into the equation $f(2) = 9$
3. Solving the resulting equation for $c$

The Lean code is elegant and concise because it leverages Lean's automation to handle the arithmetic. The `norm_num` tactic simplifies numerical expressions, and `linarith` solves linear arithmetic problems. Together, they handle the calculation and solving process that we did manually above.
