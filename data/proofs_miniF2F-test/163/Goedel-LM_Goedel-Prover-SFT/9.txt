  Given the function \( f(x) = cx^3 - 9x + 3 \) and the condition \( f(2) = 9 \), we need to find the value of \( c \). By substituting \( x = 2 \) into the function and setting the result equal to 9, we can solve for \( c \).
  1. Substitute \( x = 2 \) into \( f(x) \):
     \[
     f(2) = c \cdot 2^3 - 9 \cdot 2 + 3
     \]
  2. Simplify the expression:
     \[
     f(2) = c \cdot 8 - 18 + 3
     \]
  3. Combine like terms:
     \[
     f(2) = 8c - 15
     \]
  4. Set the expression equal to 9:
     \[
     8c - 15 = 9
     \]
  5. Solve for \( c \):
     \[
     8c = 24 \implies c = 3
     \]
  Thus, the value of \( c \) is \( 3 \).
