  Given the function \( f(x) = cx^3 - 9x + 3 \) and the condition \( f(2) = 9 \), we need to find the value of \( c \). Substituting \( x = 2 \) into the function, we get:
  \[ f(2) = c \cdot 2^3 - 9 \cdot 2 + 3 = 9 \]
  Simplifying the expression:
  \[ c \cdot 8 - 18 + 3 = 9 \]
  \[ 8c - 15 = 9 \]
  Solving for \( c \):
  \[ 8c = 24 \]
  \[ c = 3 \]
  Thus, the value of \( c \) is 3.
