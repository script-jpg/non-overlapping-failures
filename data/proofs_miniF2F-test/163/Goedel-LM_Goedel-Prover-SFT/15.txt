  Given the function \( f(x) = cx^3 - 9x + 3 \) and the condition \( f(2) = 9 \), we need to determine the value of \( c \). By substituting \( x = 2 \) into the function, we get:
  \[ f(2) = c \cdot 2^3 - 9 \cdot 2 + 3 \]
  Simplifying this equation:
  \[ 9 = c \cdot 8 - 18 + 3 \]
  \[ 9 = 8c - 15 \]
  Adding 15 to both sides:
  \[ 24 = 8c \]
  Dividing both sides by 8:
  \[ c = 3 \]
  Thus, the value of \( c \) is 3.
