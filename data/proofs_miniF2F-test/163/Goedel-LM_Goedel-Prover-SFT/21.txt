  Given the function \( f(x) = cx^3 - 9x + 3 \) and the condition \( f(2) = 9 \), we need to find the value of \( c \). Substituting \( x = 2 \) into the function, we get:
  \[ f(2) = c(2)^3 - 9(2) + 3 \]
  Simplifying this, we have:
  \[ 9 = 8c - 18 + 3 \]
  Combining like terms, we obtain:
  \[ 9 = 8c - 15 \]
  Solving for \( c \), we add 15 to both sides:
  \[ 24 = 8c \]
  Dividing both sides by 8, we find:
  \[ c = 3 \]
  Thus, the value of \( c \) is \( 3 \).
