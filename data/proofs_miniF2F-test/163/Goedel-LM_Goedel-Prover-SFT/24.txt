  Given the function \( f(x) = cx^3 - 9x + 3 \) and the condition \( f(2) = 9 \), we need to determine the value of \( c \). Substituting \( x = 2 \) into the function, we get:
  \[ f(2) = c(2)^3 - 9(2) + 3 \]
  Simplifying the expression:
  \[ 9 = 8c - 18 + 3 \]
  \[ 9 = 8c - 15 \]
  Adding 15 to both sides to isolate the term with \( c \):
  \[ 24 = 8c \]
  Dividing both sides by 8 to solve for \( c \):
  \[ c = 3 \]
