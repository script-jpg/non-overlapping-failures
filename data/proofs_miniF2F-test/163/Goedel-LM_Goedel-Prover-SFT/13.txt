  Given the function \( f(x) = cx^3 - 9x + 3 \) and the condition \( f(2) = 9 \), we need to determine the value of \( c \). We start by substituting \( x = 2 \) into the function and setting the result equal to 9. This gives us the equation:
  \[ c \cdot 2^3 - 9 \cdot 2 + 3 = 9 \]
  Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:
  \[ 8c - 18 + 3 = 9 \]
  Combining like terms, we obtain:
  \[ 8c - 15 = 9 \]
  Adding 15 to both sides to isolate the term with \( c \), we find:
  \[ 8c = 24 \]
  Finally, dividing both sides by 8, we get:
  \[ c = 3 \]
  Thus, the value of \( c \) is 3.
