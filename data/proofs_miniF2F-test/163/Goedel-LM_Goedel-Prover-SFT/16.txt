  Given the function \( f(x) = cx^3 - 9x + 3 \) and the condition \( f(2) = 9 \), we need to find the value of \( c \). We start by substituting \( x = 2 \) into the function and equating it to 9. This gives us an equation involving \( c \). Solving this equation will yield the value of \( c \).
  1. Substitute \( x = 2 \) into \( f(x) \):
     \[
     f(2) = c \cdot 2^3 - 9 \cdot 2 + 3 = 9
     \]
  2. Simplify the expression:
     \[
     8c - 18 + 3 = 9
     \]
  3. Combine like terms:
     \[
     8c - 15 = 9
     \]
  4. Isolate \( c \) by adding 15 to both sides:
     \[
     8c = 24
     \]
  5. Solve for \( c \) by dividing both sides by 8:
     \[
     c = 3
     \]
