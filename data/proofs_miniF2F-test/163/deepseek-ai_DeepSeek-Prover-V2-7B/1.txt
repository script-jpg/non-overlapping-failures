    -- Substitute \( x = 2 \) into the function and simplify
    simp_all only [h₀, mul_one, mul_zero, sub_zero, zero_add, mul_neg, mul_assoc]
    /- Simplifies the equation to:
       \( 2^3 \cdot c - 9 \cdot 2 + 3 = 9 \)
       Which further simplifies to:
       \( 8c - 18 + 3 = 9 \)
       And then to:
       \( 8c - 15 = 9 \)
