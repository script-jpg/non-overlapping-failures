  To show that the maximum value of \(\frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{4^t}\) for real values of \(t\) is at most \(\frac{1}{12}\), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Establish the inequality**: We need to show that \(\frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{4^t} \leq \frac{1}{12}\). This can be rewritten as:
     \[
     \frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{4^t} \leq \frac{1}{12}
     \]
  2. **Simplify the expression**: Multiply both sides by \(4^t\) to clear the denominator:
     \[
     (2^t - 3t)t \leq \frac{1}{12} \cdot 4^t
     \]
     Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:
     \[
     \frac{1}{12} \cdot 4^t = \frac{4^t}{12}
     \]
  3. **Analyze the left-hand side**: We need to show that \((2^t - 3t)t \leq \frac{4^t}{12}\). This can be further simplified by considering the non-negativity of certain expressions and applying basic algebraic manipulations and inequalities.
