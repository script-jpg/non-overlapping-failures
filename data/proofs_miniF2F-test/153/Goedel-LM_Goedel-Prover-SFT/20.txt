  To show that the maximum value of \(\frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{4^t}\) for real values of \(t\) is \(\frac{1}{12}\), we start by analyzing the expression. We need to prove that \(\frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{4^t} \leq \frac{1}{12}\).
  First, we simplify the expression by noting that \(4^t = (2^t)^2\). We can rewrite the inequality as:
  \[
  \frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{(2^t)^2} \leq \frac{1}{12}
  \]
  Next, we simplify the left-hand side by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by 12:
  \[
  \frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{12} \leq 1
  \]
  This inequality is equivalent to:
  \[
  (2^t - 3t)t \leq 12
  \]
  We need to show that for all real \(t\), \((2^t - 3t)t \leq 12\). To do this, we consider the expression \((2^t - 3t)t\) and show that it is always less than or equal to 12.
