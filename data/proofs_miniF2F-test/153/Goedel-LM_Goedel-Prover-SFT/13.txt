  To show that the maximum value of \(\frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{4^t}\) for real values of \(t\) is \(\frac{1}{12}\), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Establish the non-negativity of the denominator**: Since \(4^t\) is always positive for any real \(t\), we can safely divide by \(4^t\).
  2. **Simplify the inequality**: We rewrite the inequality \(\frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{4^t} \leq \frac{1}{12}\) as \((2^t - 3t)t \leq \frac{4^t}{12}\).
  3. **Analyze the left-hand side**: The expression \((2^t - 3t)t\) can be analyzed by considering the maximum value it can take.
  4. **Use algebraic manipulation and known inequalities**: By applying algebraic manipulation and known inequalities, we can show that the left-hand side is bounded above by \(\frac{1}{12}\).
