  To show that the maximum value of \(\frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{4^t}\) for real values of \(t\) is \(\frac{1}{12}\), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Establish a non-negativity condition**: We first show that \(\frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{4^t} \leq \frac{1}{12}\). This involves demonstrating that the numerator is bounded by the denominator multiplied by \(\frac{1}{12}\).
  2. **Simplify the expression**: Using algebraic manipulation and properties of real numbers, we simplify the expression and show that it is indeed bounded by \(\frac{1}{12}\).

  -- We start by proving a preliminary inequality.
  have h₀ : (2 ^ t - 3 * t) * t / 4 ^ t ≤ 1 / 12 := by
    -- Use the fact that the denominator is positive to apply the division inequality.
    apply div_le_of_nonneg_of_le_mul <;> norm_num <;>
    -- Show that the numerator is bounded by the denominator multiplied by 1/12.
    nlinarith [sq_nonneg (t - 1), sq_nonneg (2 ^ t - 3 * t)]
  -- Since the preliminary inequality holds, we can conclude the proof.
