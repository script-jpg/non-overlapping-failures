  To show that the maximum value of \(\frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{4^t}\) for real values of \(t\) is at most \(\frac{1}{12}\), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Establish the non-negativity of the denominator**: Since \(4^t = (2^2)^t = 2^{2t}\) is always positive for any real \(t\), the denominator \(4^t\) is positive.
  2. **Rewrite the inequality**: We can rewrite the inequality \(\frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{4^t} \leq \frac{1}{12}\) as \((2^t - 3t)t \leq \frac{4^t}{12}\).
  3. **Simplify the right-hand side**: The right-hand side \(\frac{4^t}{12}\) can be simplified to \(\frac{2^{2t}}{12}\).
  4. **Apply the inequality**: We need to show that \((2^t - 3t)t \leq \frac{2^{2t}}{12}\).
  5. **Use algebraic manipulation and properties of squares**: By considering the square of \(2^t - 3t\), we can derive the desired inequality.
