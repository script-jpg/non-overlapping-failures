  To show that the maximum value of \(\frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{4^t}\) for real values of \(t\) is \(\frac{1}{12}\), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Establish the inequality**: We need to show that \(\frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{4^t} \leq \frac{1}{12}\).
  2. **Rewrite the inequality**: Multiply both sides by \(4^t\) to clear the denominator: \((2^t - 3t)t \leq \frac{1}{12} \cdot 4^t\).
  3. **Simplify the right-hand side**: The right-hand side simplifies to \(4^t \cdot \frac{1}{12}\).
  4. **Analyze the left-hand side**: The left-hand side \((2^t - 3t)t\) can be analyzed to show that it is bounded above by \(4^t \cdot \frac{1}{12}\).
  5. **Conclude the proof**: By using basic algebraic manipulations and the fact that \(2^t \leq 4^t\) for all \(t\), we can confirm that the inequality holds.
