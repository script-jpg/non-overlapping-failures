  To show that the maximum value of \(\frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{4^t}\) for real values of \(t\) is \(\frac{1}{12}\), we start by analyzing the expression. We can rewrite the inequality \(\frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{4^t} \leq \frac{1}{12}\) as \((2^t - 3t)t \leq \frac{4^t}{12}\). Simplifying the right-hand side, we get \((2^t - 3t)t \leq \frac{4^t}{3}\).
  Next, we need to show that for any real number \(t\), \((2^t - 3t)t \leq \frac{4^t}{3}\). This can be verified using algebraic manipulation and basic properties of exponents and inequalities.
