  To prove that the maximum value of \(\frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{4^t}\) for real values of \(t\) is \(\frac{1}{12}\), we start by analyzing the expression. We need to show that the expression is always less than or equal to \(\frac{1}{12}\). This can be achieved by considering the behavior of the terms involved and their limits.
  1. **Simplify the expression**: We start by simplifying the given expression \(\frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{4^t}\).
  2. **Apply numerical bounds**: Using numerical methods or known inequalities, we can establish bounds for the terms involved.
  3. **Combine results**: By combining the bounds, we can show that the expression is always less than or equal to \(\frac{1}{12}\).
