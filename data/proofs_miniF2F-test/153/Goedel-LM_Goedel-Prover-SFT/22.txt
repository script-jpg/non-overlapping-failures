  To show that the maximum value of \(\frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{4^t}\) for real values of \(t\) is \(\frac{1}{12}\), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Establish the positivity of the denominator**: Since \(4^t\) is always positive for any real \(t\), we can safely divide the numerator by \(4^t\).
  2. **Rewrite the inequality**: We need to show that \(\frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{4^t} \leq \frac{1}{12}\). This can be rewritten as \((2^t - 3t)t \leq \frac{1}{12} \cdot 4^t\).
  3. **Simplify the right-hand side**: The right-hand side simplifies to \(\frac{4^t}{12}\).
  4. **Use algebraic manipulation and known inequalities**: We use the fact that \(4^t\) grows exponentially and apply basic algebraic inequalities to show that \((2^t - 3t)t \leq \frac{4^t}{12}\).
