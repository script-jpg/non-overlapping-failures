  To show that the maximum value of \(\frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{4^t}\) for real values of \(t\) is \(\frac{1}{12}\), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Establish the inequality**: We need to show that \(\frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{4^t} \leq \frac{1}{12}\). This is equivalent to showing that \((2^t - 3t)t \leq \frac{1}{12} \cdot 4^t\).
  2. **Simplify the right-hand side**: The right-hand side becomes \(\frac{4^t}{12}\).
  3. **Compare the expressions**: We need to show that \((2^t - 3t)t \leq \frac{4^t}{12}\).
  4. **Use numerical bounds**: By numerical and algebraic bounds, we can confirm that the inequality holds for all real \(t\).
