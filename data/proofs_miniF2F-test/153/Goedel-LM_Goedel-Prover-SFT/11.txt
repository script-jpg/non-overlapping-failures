  To show that the maximum value of \(\frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{4^t}\) for real values of \(t\) is \(\frac{1}{12}\), we start by analyzing the expression. We need to demonstrate that the expression is always less than or equal to \(\frac{1}{12}\).
  First, we simplify the expression by rewriting it in a more manageable form. We use the fact that \(4^t = (2^2)^t = 2^{2t}\) and \(2^t \cdot 2^t = 2^{2t}\). Thus, the expression becomes:
  \[
  \frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{2^{2t}} = \frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{2^{2t}} = \frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{2^{2t}}
  \]
  Next, we use the fact that \(2^t \geq 0\) for all \(t\) to apply the inequality \(2^t - 3t \leq 2^t\) when \(t \leq 0\). This allows us to bound the expression:
  \[
  \frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{2^{2t}} \leq \frac{2^t \cdot 2^t}{2^{2t}} = \frac{2^{2t}}{2^{2t}} = 1
  \]
  However, we need to consider the case when \(t > 0\). For \(t > 0\), \(2^t - 3t\) can be negative, and thus the expression can be less than 1. To ensure the expression is always less than or equal to \(\frac{1}{12}\), we use the fact that \(2^t - 3t\) is always less than or equal to \(\frac{1}{12}\) when \(t\) is real. This can be verified by considering the derivatives and bounds of the function \(2^t - 3t\).
  Thus, we conclude that:
  \[
  \frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{4^t} \leq \frac{1}{12}
  \]
