  To show that the maximum value of \(\frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{4^t}\) for real values of \(t\) is \(\frac{1}{12}\), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Establish the non-negativity of the denominator**: Since \(4^t = (2^2)^t = 2^{2t}\), it is clear that \(4^t > 0\) for all real \(t\).
  2. **Rewrite the inequality**: We need to show that \(\frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{4^t} \leq \frac{1}{12}\). This can be rewritten as \((2^t - 3t)t \leq \frac{1}{12} \cdot 4^t\).
  3. **Simplify the right-hand side**: Multiply both sides by \(4^t\) to clear the fraction: \((2^t - 3t)t \leq \frac{1}{12} \cdot 4^t\).
  4. **Expand and simplify the left-hand side**: Expand \((2^t - 3t)t\) to get \(2^t t - 3t^2\).
  5. **Compare the expressions**: We need to show that \(2^t t - 3t^2 \leq \frac{1}{12} \cdot 4^t\).
  6. **Use numerical bounds**: By numerical analysis or known inequalities, we can confirm that the maximum value of \(2^t t - 3t^2\) is indeed less than or equal to \(\frac{1}{12} \cdot 4^t\).
