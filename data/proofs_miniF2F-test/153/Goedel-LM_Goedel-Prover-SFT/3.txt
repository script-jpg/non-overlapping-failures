  To show that the maximum value of \(\frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{4^t}\) for real values of \(t\) is \(\frac{1}{12}\), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Establish the inequality**: We need to show that \(\frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{4^t} \leq \frac{1}{12}\).
  2. **Rewrite the inequality**: Multiply both sides by \(4^t\) to clear the denominator: \((2^t - 3t)t \leq \frac{1}{12} \cdot 4^t\).
  3. **Simplify the right-hand side**: Since \(\frac{1}{12} \cdot 4^t = \frac{4^t}{12}\), we have \((2^t - 3t)t \leq \frac{4^t}{12}\).
  4. **Analyze the left-hand side**: The expression \((2^t - 3t)t\) can be analyzed for its maximum value.
  5. **Use algebraic manipulation**: By manipulating the expression and using known inequalities, we can show that the maximum value of \((2^t - 3t)t\) is indeed \(\frac{1}{12}\).
