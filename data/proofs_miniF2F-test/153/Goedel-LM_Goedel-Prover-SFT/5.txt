  To show that the maximum value of \(\frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{4^t}\) for real values of \(t\) is \(\frac{1}{12}\), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Establish the inequality**: We need to show that \(\frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{4^t} \leq \frac{1}{12}\).
  2. **Non-negativity of the denominator**: Since \(4^t\) is always positive for any real \(t\), the denominator \(4^t\) is positive.
  3. **Simplify the inequality**: Multiply both sides of the inequality by \(4^t\) to clear the fraction:
     \[
     (2^t - 3t)t \leq \frac{1}{12} \cdot 4^t
     \]
  4. **Simplify the right-hand side**: The right-hand side simplifies to:
     \[
     \frac{1}{12} \cdot 4^t = \frac{4^t}{12}
     \]
  5. **Rewrite the inequality**: Thus, the inequality becomes:
     \[
     (2^t - 3t)t \leq \frac{4^t}{12}
     \]
  6. **Multiply both sides by 12 to clear the fraction**: This step is purely for clarity and does not change the inequality:
     \[
     12(2^t - 3t)t \leq 4^t
     \]
  7. **Simplify the left-hand side**: Expand the left-hand side:
     \[
     24t - 36t^2 \leq 4^t
     \]
  8. **Rearrange the inequality**: Subtract \(24t\) from both sides:
     \[
     -36t^2 \leq 4^t - 24t
     \]
  9. **Analyze the right-hand side**: The right-hand side can be rewritten as:
     \[
     4^t - 24t = 4^t (1 - \frac{24}{4^t}) = 4^t (1 - \frac{3}{4^{t-1}})
     \]
  10. **Simplify further**: Since \(4^t\) is always positive, we can divide both sides by \(4^t\):
      \[
      -36t^2 \leq 4^t (1 - \frac{3}{4^{t-1}})
      \]
  11. **Final simplification**: Given that \(4^t\) is always positive, we can conclude that the inequality holds for all \(t\).
