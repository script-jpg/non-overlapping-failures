  To show that the maximum value of \(\frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{4^t}\) for real values of \(t\) is at most \(\frac{1}{12}\), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Establish the inequality**: We need to show that \(\frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{4^t} \leq \frac{1}{12}\).
  2. **Use the division property**: Rewrite the inequality using the division property to isolate the numerator and denominator.
  3. **Apply algebraic manipulation**: Use algebraic manipulation to compare the numerator and the denominator directly.
  4. **Verify the inequality**: Use numerical or algebraic methods to confirm that the inequality holds for all real \(t\).
