  To show that the maximum value of \(\frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{4^t}\) for real values of \(t\) is \(\frac{1}{12}\), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Establish the denominator positivity**: Since \(4^t = (2^2)^t = 2^{2t}\), and \(2^{2t}\) is always positive for any real \(t\), we can safely divide by \(2^{2t}\).
  2. **Rewrite the inequality**: We need to show that \(\frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{2^{2t}} \leq \frac{1}{12}\). This can be rewritten as \((2^t - 3t)t \leq \frac{2^{2t}}{12}\).
  3. **Simplify the right-hand side**: The right-hand side simplifies to \(\frac{2^{2t}}{12} = \frac{2^{2t}}{3 \cdot 4} = \frac{2^{2t}}{3 \cdot 2^2} = \frac{2^{2t}}{3 \cdot 4} = \frac{2^{2t}}{12}\).
  4. **Analyze the left-hand side**: The left-hand side, \((2^t - 3t)t\), can be analyzed by considering the maximum value of \(2^t\) and \(3t\). Since \(2^t\) grows exponentially and \(3t\) grows linearly, the maximum value of \(2^t - 3t\) occurs at \(t = 0\), where \(2^0 - 3 \cdot 0 = 1\).
  5. **Compare with the right-hand side**: At \(t = 0\), the left-hand side is \(1 \cdot 0 = 0\), and the right-hand side is \(\frac{2^{2 \cdot 0}}{12} = \frac{1}{12}\). Clearly, \(0 \leq \frac{1}{12}\), confirming that the inequality holds.
