  To show that the maximum value of \(\frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{4^t}\) for real values of \(t\) is \(\frac{1}{12}\), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Establish the inequality**: We need to show that \(\frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{4^t} \leq \frac{1}{12}\).
  2. **Simplify the expression**: Rewrite the inequality in a more manageable form.
  3. **Apply algebraic manipulations**: Use algebraic operations to simplify the expression.
  4. **Verify the inequality**: Use numerical or algebraic techniques to confirm the inequality holds.
