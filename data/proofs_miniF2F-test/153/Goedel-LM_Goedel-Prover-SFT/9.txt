  To show that the maximum value of \(\frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{4^t}\) for real values of \(t\) is \(\frac{1}{12}\), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Establish the inequality**: We need to show that \(\frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{4^t} \leq \frac{1}{12}\).
  2. **Rewrite the inequality**: Multiply both sides by \(4^t\) to clear the denominator: \((2^t - 3t)t \leq \frac{1}{12} \cdot 4^t\).
  3. **Simplify the right-hand side**: \(\frac{1}{12} \cdot 4^t = \frac{4^t}{12}\).
  4. **Compare both sides**: We need to show that \((2^t - 3t)t \leq \frac{4^t}{12}\).
  5. **Use arithmetic and algebraic properties**: By considering the non-negativity of squares and applying basic algebraic manipulations, we can verify that the inequality holds.
