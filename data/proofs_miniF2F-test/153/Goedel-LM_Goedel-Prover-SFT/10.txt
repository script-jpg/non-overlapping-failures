  To show that the maximum value of \(\frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{4^t}\) for real values of \(t\) is \(\frac{1}{12}\), we start by rewriting the expression and applying algebraic inequalities. We first simplify the expression using algebraic manipulations and then use the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative to establish the desired inequality.
