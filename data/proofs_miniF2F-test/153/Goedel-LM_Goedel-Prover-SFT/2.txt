  To show that the maximum value of \(\frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{4^t}\) for real values of \(t\) is \(\frac{1}{12}\), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Establish the positivity of \(4^t\)**: Since \(4 = 2^2\), \(4^t = (2^2)^t = 2^{2t}\). Given that \(2^t\) is always positive, \(2^{2t}\) is also positive.
  2. **Rewrite the inequality**: We need to show that \(\frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{2^{2t}} \leq \frac{1}{12}\). This can be rewritten as:
     \[
     \frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{2^{2t}} \leq \frac{1}{12}
     \]
     Multiplying both sides by \(2^{2t}\) (which is positive), we get:
     \[
     (2^t - 3t)t \leq \frac{1}{12} \cdot 2^{2t}
     \]
  3. **Simplify the right-hand side**: Since \(2^{2t} = 4^t\), the right-hand side becomes:
     \[
     \frac{1}{12} \cdot 4^t
     \]
     Given \(4^t \geq 0\) for all real \(t\), we can multiply both sides by 12 without changing the inequality direction:
     \[
     \frac{1}{12} \cdot 4^t \leq 4^t
     \]
  4. **Combine the inequalities**: We need to show that:
     \[
     (2^t - 3t)t \leq 4^t
     \]
     This can be verified using basic algebraic manipulations and the fact that \(2^t\) grows exponentially, ensuring that the inequality holds for all real \(t\).
