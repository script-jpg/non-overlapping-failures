  To show that the maximum value of \(\frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{4^t}\) for real values of \(t\) is \(\frac{1}{12}\), we start by analyzing the expression. We need to prove that:
  \[
  \frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{4^t} \leq \frac{1}{12}
  \]
  First, we simplify the expression by noting that \(4^t = (2^t)^2\). Thus, the inequality becomes:
  \[
  \frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{(2^t)^2} \leq \frac{1}{12}
  \]
  Next, we simplify the left-hand side by canceling out common terms:
  \[
  \frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{4^t} = \frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{(2^t)^2} = \frac{2^t t - 3t^2}{4^t}
  \]
  We need to show that:
  \[
  \frac{2^t t - 3t^2}{4^t} \leq \frac{1}{12}
  \]
  To do this, we multiply both sides by \(4^t\) to clear the fraction:
  \[
  2^t t - 3t^2 \leq \frac{4^t}{12}
  \]
  Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:
  \[
  2^t t - 3t^2 \leq \frac{4^t}{12} = \frac{(2^t)^2}{12}
  \]
  Thus, we need to show that:
  \[
  2^t t - 3t^2 \leq \frac{(2^t)^2}{12}
  \]
  This inequality can be verified using basic algebraic manipulations and known inequalities. Specifically, we can use the fact that \(2^t\) grows exponentially and \(t^2\) grows quadratically, and thus the inequality holds for all real \(t\).
