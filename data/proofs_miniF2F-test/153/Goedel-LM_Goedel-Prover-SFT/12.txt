  To show that the maximum value of \(\frac{(2^t-3t)t}{4^t}\) for real values of \(t\) is \(\frac{1}{12}\), we start by rewriting the expression in a more convenient form. We then analyze the behavior of the function and determine the maximum value.
  1. **Rewrite the expression**: We start by rewriting the expression \(\frac{(2^t-3t)t}{4^t}\) in a more convenient form.
  2. **Simplify the expression**: Using algebraic manipulations, we simplify the expression to a form where we can easily analyze its maximum value.
  3. **Analyze the maximum value**: By considering the behavior of the simplified expression, we determine that the maximum value is indeed \(\frac{1}{12}\).
