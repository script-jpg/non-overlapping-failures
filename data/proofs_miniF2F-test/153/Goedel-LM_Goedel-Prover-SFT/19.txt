  To show that the maximum value of \(\frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{4^t}\) for real values of \(t\) is \(\frac{1}{12}\), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Establish the inequality**: We need to show that \(\frac{(2^t - 3t)t}{4^t} \leq \frac{1}{12}\) for all \(t \in \mathbb{R}\).
  2. **Use the division property**: Rewrite the inequality using the division property, ensuring that the denominator is positive.
  3. **Simplify the expression**: Use algebraic manipulation to simplify the expression.
  4. **Apply the square term**: Use the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative to establish the inequality.
