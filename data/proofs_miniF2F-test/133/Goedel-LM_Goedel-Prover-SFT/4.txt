  To show that \( p \) divides \( a^p - a \) for a prime number \( p \) and a positive integer \( a \), we can use the property of prime numbers and the fact that \( p \) divides \( a^p - a \) directly. Specifically, we will use the fact that for any integer \( a \) and a prime \( p \), \( p \) divides \( a^p - a \). This can be derived from the fact that any integer \( a \) modulo \( p \) can be considered, and since \( p \) is prime, it will divide the expression \( a^p - a \) modulo \( p \).
