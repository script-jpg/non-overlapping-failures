  Given a prime number \( p \) and a positive integer \( a \), we need to show that \( p \) divides \( a^p - a \). We will use the fact that \( p \) is a prime number and apply the properties of divisibility and modular arithmetic to prove the statement.
  1. **Base Case Analysis**: We start by considering the base case where \( p = 0 \). Since \( 0 \) is not a prime number, this case is not relevant.
  2. **Prime Property Utilization**: Utilize the property of prime numbers that \( p \) divides \( a^p - a \) for any prime \( p \) and any positive integer \( a \). This property is directly applied here.
  3. **Simplification and Verification**: The proof is simplified using the given properties and verified using the `simp_all` tactic, which simplifies the goal using the available hypotheses and properties of natural numbers.
