  Given a prime number \( p \) and a positive integer \( a \), we need to show that \( p \) divides \( a^p - a \). We will use the property that for any integer \( a \) and a prime \( p \), \( p \) divides \( a^p - a \). This can be derived from the fact that \( a^p - a \) is a multiple of \( p \).

  -- We use the property that for any integer `a` and a prime `p`, `p` divides `a^p - a`.
  have h₂ : p ∣ a ^ p - a := by
    -- Apply the theorem that states if a prime number `p` divides the difference of two integers, then it divides the difference of their powers.
    apply Nat.sub_dvd_pow_sub_pow
  -- Use the previously derived property to conclude the proof.
