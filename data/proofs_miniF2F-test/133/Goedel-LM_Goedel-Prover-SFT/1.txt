  Given a prime number \( p \) and a positive integer \( a \), we need to show that \( p \) divides \( a^p - a \). We will use the property that for any integer \( a \) and prime \( p \), \( p \) divides \( a^p - a \). This can be derived from the fact that \( p \) is a prime number and \( a \) is a positive integer, leading to the conclusion that \( p \) divides \( a^p - a \).

  -- We use the property that for any integer `a` and prime `p`, `p` divides `a^p - a`.
  have h : p ∣ a ^ p - a := by
    -- Apply the theorem `Nat.Prime.dvd_pow_sub_self` which states that if `p` is a prime and `a` is a positive integer, then `p` divides `a^p - a`.
    apply Nat.Prime.dvd_pow_sub_self h₁
    -- Ensure that `a` is a positive integer, which is given by `h₀`.
    exact h₀
  -- The result `h` shows that `p` divides `a^p - a`, so we can conclude the proof.
  exact h
