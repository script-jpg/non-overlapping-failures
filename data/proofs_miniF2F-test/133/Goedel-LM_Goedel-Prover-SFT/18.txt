  Given a prime number \( p \) and a positive integer \( a \), we need to show that \( p \) divides \( a^p - a \). We will use the fact that for any integer \( k \), \( p \) divides \( a^k - a \) if \( p \) divides \( a^p - a \). Specifically, we will show that \( p \) divides \( a^p - a \) by demonstrating that the remainder when \( a^p - a \) is divided by \( p \) is zero.
