  Let \( p \) be a prime number and \( a \) a positive integer. We need to show that \( p \) divides \( a^p - a \).
  1. **Base Case**: When \( p = 1 \), \( a^1 - a = 0 \), and any prime number \( p \) divides 0.
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds for some prime \( p \). We need to show it holds for \( p + 1 \).
     - If \( p = 2 \), then \( a^2 - a \) can be rewritten as \( a(a - 1) \). Since \( a \) is a positive integer, \( a \) and \( a - 1 \) are consecutive integers, and any prime number \( p \) divides \( a(a - 1) \).
     - For \( p > 2 \), we use the fact that \( a^p - a \) can be factored as \( a(a^{p-1} - 1) \). Since \( p \) is a prime number, \( a \) and \( a^{p-1} - 1 \) are integers, and \( p \) divides \( a(a^{p-1} - 1) \).
