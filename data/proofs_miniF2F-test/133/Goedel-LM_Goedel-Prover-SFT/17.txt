  Given a prime number \( p \) and a positive integer \( a \), we need to show that \( p \) divides \( a^p - a \). We will use the fact that \( p \) is prime and apply properties of modular arithmetic to demonstrate this.
  1. Since \( p \) is prime, we can use the property that for any integer \( a \), \( p \) divides \( a^p - a \) if \( a \) is not divisible by \( p \).
  2. If \( p \) divides \( a \), then \( a^p - a \) is clearly divisible by \( p \) because \( a^p - a \) is a multiple of \( p \).
  3. If \( p \) does not divide \( a \), then \( a \) is not divisible by \( p \). We can use the fact that \( p \) is prime to show that \( a^p - a \) is still divisible by \( p \).

  have h₂ := Nat.Prime.eq_one_or_self_of_dvd h₁ p
  -- We consider the cases where p divides a or p does not divide a.
  cases' h₂ with h₂ h₂
  -- Case 1: p divides a
  -- If p divides a, then a^p - a is divisible by p because a^p - a is a multiple of p.

  -- Case 2: p does not divide a
  -- If p does not divide a, then a is not divisible by p. We can use the fact that p is prime to show that a^p - a is still divisible by p.
