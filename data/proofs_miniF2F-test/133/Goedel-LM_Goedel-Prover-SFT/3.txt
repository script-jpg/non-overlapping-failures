  Given a prime number \( p \) and a positive integer \( a \), we need to show that \( p \) divides \( a^p - a \). We will use the fact that for any integer \( a \), \( a^p - a \) is divisible by \( p \) if \( p \) is a prime number. Specifically, we will use the theorem that states \( p \) divides \( a^p - a \) for any prime \( p \) and any integer \( a \).

  -- We use the fact that for any integer `a`, `a^p - a` is divisible by `p` if `p` is a prime number.
  have h : p ∣ a ^ p - a := by
    -- Apply the theorem `Nat.Prime.dvd_pow_sub_self` which states that `p` divides `a^p - a` for any prime `p` and any integer `a`.
    apply Nat.Prime.dvd_pow_sub_self h₁
    -- Ensure that `a` is not zero to satisfy the condition of the theorem.

  -- The result `h` directly gives us the desired divisibility.
