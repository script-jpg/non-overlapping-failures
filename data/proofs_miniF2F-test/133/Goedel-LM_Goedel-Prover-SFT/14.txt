  Given a prime number \( p \) and a positive integer \( a \), we need to show that \( p \) divides \( a^p - a \). We will use the property of binomial expansions and the fact that \( p \) is a prime to derive the result.
  1. **Binomial Expansion**: The binomial expansion of \( (a + 1)^p \) is given by:
     \[
     (a + 1)^p = \sum_{k=0}^{p} \binom{p}{k} a^{p-k} 1^k = \sum_{k=0}^{p} \binom{p}{k} a^{p-k}
     \]
  2. **Simplification**: The term \( a^p \) can be written as:
     \[
     a^p = \sum_{k=0}^{p} \binom{p}{k} a^{p-k}
     \]
  3. **Subtracting \( a \)**: Subtracting \( a \) from \( a^p \), we get:
     \[
     a^p - a = \sum_{k=0}^{p} \binom{p}{k} a^{p-k} - a
     \]
  4. **Prime Factorization**: Since \( p \) is a prime, it divides the sum \( \sum_{k=0}^{p} \binom{p}{k} a^{p-k} - a \) because \( p \) divides the term \( a^{p-1} \) (which is a product of \( a \) and \( a^{p-2} \)).
  Thus, \( p \) divides \( a^p - a \).
