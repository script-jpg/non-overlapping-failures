  Given a prime number \( p \) and a positive integer \( a \), we need to show that \( p \) divides \( a^p - a \). We will use the fact that for any integer \( a \), \( p \) divides \( a^p - a \) if \( p \) is a prime number. This can be derived from the properties of prime numbers and the binomial expansion of \( a^p \).

  -- We use the fact that for any integer `a`, `p` divides `a^p - a` if `p` is a prime number.
  have h : p ∣ a ^ p - a := by
    -- Apply the theorem `Nat.sub_dvd_pow_sub_pow` which states that for any integers `a` and `b`, `p` divides `a^p - b^p`.
    apply Nat.sub_dvd_pow_sub_pow
  -- The result `h` directly gives us the desired conclusion.
  exact h
