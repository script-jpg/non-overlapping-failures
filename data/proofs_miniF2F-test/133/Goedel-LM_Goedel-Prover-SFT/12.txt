  Given a prime number \( p \) and a positive integer \( a \), we need to show that \( p \) divides \( a^p - a \). We will use the property of prime numbers and modular arithmetic to demonstrate this.
  1. Since \( p \) is a prime number, we know that \( p \) is greater than 1.
  2. We can express \( a^p - a \) in a form that involves powers of \( a \).
  3. Using the fact that \( p \) is prime, we can use properties of modular arithmetic to show that \( a^p - a \) is congruent to 0 modulo \( p \).
  4. This implies that \( a^p - a \) is divisible by \( p \).

  -- We use the property of prime numbers and modular arithmetic to show that p divides a^p - a.
  -- Specifically, we use the fact that if a number is congruent to 0 modulo p, then it is divisible by p.
