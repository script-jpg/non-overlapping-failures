  Given a prime number \( p \) and a positive integer \( a \), we need to show that \( p \) divides \( a^p - a \). We start by noting that since \( p \) is a prime, \( p \) is odd. We then use the fact that the difference \( a^p - a \) can be expressed in a form that involves \( p \). Specifically, we use the identity \( a^p - a = a(a^p - 1) \) and then show that \( p \) divides \( a(a^p - 1) \). Since \( p \) is a prime, it can divide \( a \) or \( a^p - 1 \). Given that \( p \) is odd, it cannot divide \( a \) (since \( a \) is a positive integer and \( p \) is a prime). Therefore, \( p \) must divide \( a^p - 1 \). Since \( a^p - 1 \) is a product of \( a \) and \( a^p - 1 \), and \( p \) divides \( a^p - 1 \), it follows that \( p \) divides \( a(a^p - 1) \). Thus, \( p \) divides \( a^p - a \).

  -- Since p is a prime, it is odd.
  have h : p ∣ a ^ p - a := by
    -- Use the fact that p divides a^p - a.
    apply Nat.dvd_of_mod_eq_zero
    -- Rewrite a^p - a in a form that involves p.
    rw [← Nat.mod_add_div (a ^ p) a]
    -- Simplify the expression using the fact that p is a prime and a is a positive integer.
    simp [Nat.pow_mod, h₁.dvd_mul, h₀, Nat.pow_mod, Nat.dvd_mul, h₀]
  -- Conclude that p divides a^p - a.
