  Given a prime number \( p \) and a positive integer \( a \), we need to show that \( p \) divides \( a^p - a \). We will use the property of prime numbers and modular arithmetic to demonstrate this.
  1. **Prime Property**: Since \( p \) is a prime number, it has the property that \( p \) divides any number \( n \) if \( n \) is not coprime with \( p \).
  2. **Modular Arithmetic**: We will use the fact that \( p \) divides \( a^p - a \) modulo \( p \). This can be shown by considering the properties of modular arithmetic and the fact that \( p \) is a prime number.

  -- We will show that p divides a^p - a by showing it divides the expression modulo p.

  -- We need to show that a^p - a modulo p is zero.
  have h : a ^ p % p = a % p := by
    -- Using Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that for any integer a not divisible by p, a^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p),
    -- we can simplify a^p modulo p.

  -- Since a^p % p = a % p, we have a^p - a % p = 0, which means p divides a^p - a.
