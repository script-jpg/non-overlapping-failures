have h2 : 0 < a ^ p := by apply Nat.pow_pos; exact h₀

  -- apply the Fermat's little theorem
  have h3 : a ^ p % p = a % p := Nat.ModEq.pow_card h₁ (by omega)

  -- convert the hypothesis to the form of divisibility
  rw [← Nat.modEq_iff_dvd'] at h3
  simp at h3

  -- obtain the desired conclusion
  exact h3
