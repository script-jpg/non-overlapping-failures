-- To prove this, we'll use the concept of modular arithmetic and properties of prime numbers.

  -- First, we need to show that $a^p \equiv a \pmod{p}$, which is equivalent to $p \mid a^p - a$.

  -- We'll proceed by using the Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that if $p$ is a prime and $a$ is an integer,
  -- then $a^p \equiv a \pmod{p}$.

  -- To apply Fermat's Little Theorem, we need to consider two cases:
  -- 1. When $a$ is not divisible by $p$ (i.e., $a \not\equiv 0 \pmod{p}$)
  -- 2. When $a$ is divisible by $p$ (i.e., $a \equiv 0 \pmod{p}$)

  -- Let's handle these cases separately.

      linarith
    | succ a =>
      -- Inductive step: assume a > 0
      -- We need to prove that p divides (a+1)^p - (a+1)
      -- Using the binomial theorem: (a+1)^p = a^p + C(p,1)a^(p-1) +... + 1
      -- When we subtract (a+1), we get a^p + C(p,1)a^(p-1) +... + 1 - (a+1)
      -- This simplifies to a^p + C(p,1)a^(p-1) +... + 1 - a - 1 = a^p + C(p,1)a^(p-1) +... - a
      -- We need to show that p divides this expression

      -- Let's apply Fermat's Little Theorem to a and a+1

      -- Case 1: If a is divisible by p, then a = kp for some integer k
      -- So a^p - a = (kp)^p - kp = k^p * p - kp = p(k^p - k), which is divisible by p

      -- Case 2: If a is not divisible by p, then by Fermat's Little Theorem, a^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p)
      -- So a^p ≡ a (mod p)
      -- Thus a^p - a ≡ 0 (mod p), meaning p divides a^p - a

      -- Similar reasoning applies to a+1

      -- So we need to show that either:
      -- - both a and a+1 are divisible by p, or
      -- - both a and a+1 are not divisible by p
      -- In either case, we can conclude that a^p - a is divisible by p

      -- To formalize this in Lean, we need to use the appropriate number theory lemmas

      -- Let's continue with the proof:

      -- We need to show that p divides (a+1)^p - (a+1)
      -- Using the binomial theorem:
      -- (a+1)^p = a^p + C(p,1)a^(p-1) +... + 1
      -- So (a+1)^p - (a+1) = a^p + C(p,1)a^(p-1) +... + 1 - (a+1)
      -- This simplifies to a^p + C(p,1)a^(p-1) +... - a

      -- We can use the fact that for a prime p, p divides C(p,k) for 1 ≤ k ≤ p-1

      -- So (a+1)^p - (a+1) ≡ a^p - a (mod p)
      -- And by the inductive hypothesis, p divides a^p - a
      -- So p divides (a+1)^p - (a+1)

      -- Let's complete the proof in Lean:
