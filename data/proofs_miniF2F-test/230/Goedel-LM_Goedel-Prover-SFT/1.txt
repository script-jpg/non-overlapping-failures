  To prove that \( s(3, 11) = \frac{1}{33} \), we start by using the definition of \( s(x, y) \):
  \[ s(x, y) = \frac{\left(\frac{1}{y} - \frac{1}{x}\right)}{(x - y)} \]
  Substituting \( x = 3 \) and \( y = 11 \):
  \[ s(3, 11) = \frac{\left(\frac{1}{11} - \frac{1}{3}\right)}{(3 - 11)} \]
  Simplifying the numerator:
  \[ \frac{1}{11} - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{3 - 11}{33} = \frac{-8}{33} \]
  Simplifying the denominator:
  \[ 3 - 11 = -8 \]
  Thus, the expression becomes:
  \[ s(3, 11) = \frac{\frac{-8}{33}}{-8} = \frac{1}{33} \]
