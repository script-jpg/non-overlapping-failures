  Given the function \( s(a, b) = \frac{\left(\frac{1}{b} - \frac{1}{a}\right)}{(a - b)} \), we need to express \( s(3, 11) \) as a common fraction and show that it equals \( \frac{1}{33} \).
  1. Substitute \( a = 3 \) and \( b = 11 \) into the function \( s \):
     \[
     s(3, 11) = \frac{\left(\frac{1}{11} - \frac{1}{3}\right)}{(3 - 11)}
     \]
  2. Simplify the numerator:
     \[
     \frac{1}{11} - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{3 - 11}{33} = \frac{-8}{33}
     \]
  3. Simplify the denominator:
     \[
     3 - 11 = -8
     \]
  4. Combine the simplified numerator and denominator:
     \[
     s(3, 11) = \frac{\frac{-8}{33}}{-8} = \frac{1}{33}
     \]
  Thus, \( s(3, 11) = \frac{1}{33} \).
