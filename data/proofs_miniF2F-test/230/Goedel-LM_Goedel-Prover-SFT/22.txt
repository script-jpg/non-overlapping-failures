  To prove that \(3 \star 11 = \frac{1}{33}\) given the operation \(a \star b = \frac{\left(\frac{1}{b} - \frac{1}{a}\right)}{(a - b)}\), we start by substituting \(a = 3\) and \(b = 11\) into the operation definition. This involves simplifying the expression step by step using algebraic manipulations.
  1. Substitute \(a = 3\) and \(b = 11\) into the operation definition:
     \[
     s(3, 11) = \frac{\left(\frac{1}{11} - \frac{1}{3}\right)}{(3 - 11)}
     \]
  2. Simplify the numerator:
     \[
     \frac{1}{11} - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{3 - 11}{33} = \frac{-8}{33}
     \]
  3. Simplify the denominator:
     \[
     3 - 11 = -8
     \]
  4. Combine the results:
     \[
     s(3, 11) = \frac{\frac{-8}{33}}{-8} = \frac{-8}{33} \times \frac{1}{-8} = \frac{1}{33}
     \]
  Thus, we have shown that \(3 \star 11 = \frac{1}{33}\).
