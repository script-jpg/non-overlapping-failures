  To solve for \(3 \star 11\) using the given operation \(a \star b = \frac{\left(\frac{1}{b} - \frac{1}{a}\right)}{(a - b)}\), we proceed as follows:
  1. Substitute \(a = 3\) and \(b = 11\) into the operation definition.
  2. Simplify the expression \(\frac{\frac{1}{11} - \frac{1}{3}}{3 - 11}\).
  3. Compute the numerator: \(\frac{1}{11} - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{3 - 11}{33} = \frac{-8}{33}\).
  4. Compute the denominator: \(3 - 11 = -8\).
  5. Divide the numerator by the denominator: \(\frac{\frac{-8}{33}}{-8} = \frac{1}{33}\).
  Thus, \(3 \star 11 = \frac{1}{33}\).
