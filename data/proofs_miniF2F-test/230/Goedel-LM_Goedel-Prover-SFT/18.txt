  To solve the expression \(3 \star 11\) where \(a \star b = \dfrac{\left(\dfrac{1}{b} - \dfrac{1}{a}\right)}{(a - b)}\), we need to follow these steps:
  1. Substitute \(a = 3\) and \(b = 11\) into the given formula.
  2. Simplify the numerator \(\dfrac{1}{11} - \dfrac{1}{3}\).
  3. Simplify the denominator \(3 - 11\).
  4. Combine the simplified numerator and denominator to get the final result.

  have h₁ : s 3 11 = (1 / 11 - 1 / 3) / (3 - 11) := by
    -- Apply the given definition of the operation s to 3 and 11.
    simpa using h₀ 3 (by norm_num) 11 (by norm_num)
  -- Simplify the expression using numerical computations.
  norm_num at h₁
  -- Since h₁ now states that s 3 11 equals 1/33, we can conclude the proof.
