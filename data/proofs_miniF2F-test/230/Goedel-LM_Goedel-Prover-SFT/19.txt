  To solve for \(3 \star 11\) using the given operation \(a \star b = \dfrac{\left(\dfrac{1}{b} - \dfrac{1}{a}\right)}{(a - b)}\), we proceed as follows:
  1. Substitute \(a = 3\) and \(b = 11\) into the operation.
  2. Compute the numerator \(\dfrac{1}{11} - \dfrac{1}{3}\).
  3. Compute the denominator \(3 - 11\).
  4. Simplify the resulting fraction.

  -- Substitute \(a = 3\) and \(b = 11\) into the operation definition.
  have h₁ : s 3 11 = (1 / 11 - 1 / 3) / (3 - 11) := by
    simpa [h₀] using h₀ 3 (by norm_num) 11 (by norm_num)
  -- Simplify the expression using numerical computations.
