  To solve for \(3 \star 11\) using the given operation \(a \star b = \dfrac{\left(\dfrac{1}{b} - \dfrac{1}{a}\right)}{(a - b)}\), we start by substituting \(a = 3\) and \(b = 11\) into the operation. This gives us:
  \[
  3 \star 11 = \dfrac{\left(\dfrac{1}{11} - \dfrac{1}{3}\right)}{(3 - 11)}
  \]
  Simplifying the numerator:
  \[
  \dfrac{1}{11} - \dfrac{1}{3} = \dfrac{3 - 11}{33} = \dfrac{-8}{33}
  \]
  Simplifying the denominator:
  \[
  3 - 11 = -8
  \]
  Thus, the expression becomes:
  \[
  3 \star 11 = \dfrac{\dfrac{-8}{33}}{-8} = \dfrac{-8}{33} \times \dfrac{1}{-8} = \dfrac{1}{33}
  \]
  Therefore, the value of \(3 \star 11\) is \(\dfrac{1}{33}\).
