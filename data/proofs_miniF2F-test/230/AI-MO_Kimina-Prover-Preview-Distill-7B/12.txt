rw [h₀ 3 (by norm_num) 11 (by norm_num)]

  norm_num

```

The `norm_num` tactic is powerful for solving arithmetic goals. Here, it's being asked to compute the value of the expression $(1/11 - 1/3)/(3 - 11)$.

Let's calculate this by hand to verify:
- $1/11 - 1/3 = (3 - 11)/(33) = -8/33$
- $3 - 11 = -8$
- So $(1/11 - 1/3)/(3 - 11) = (-8/33)/(-8) = 1/33$

The `norm_num` tactic is able to perform these calculations automatically, proving that $s 3 11 = 1/33$.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\frac{1}{33}}$.
