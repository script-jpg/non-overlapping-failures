This solution is straightforward. It directly applies the definition of the operation $\star$ to compute $3 \star 11$ and then simplifies the expression using basic arithmetic operations.

Let's compute it manually to verify:
\[
3 \star 11 = \frac{\frac{1}{11} - \frac{1}{3}}{3 - 11} = \frac{\frac{3 - 11}{33}}{-8} = \frac{\frac{-8}{33}}{-8} = \frac{1}{33}
\]

So indeed, $3 \star 11 = \frac{1}{33}$.

The Lean solution is elegant because it directly follows from the definition. The `norm_num` tactic is powerful enough to handle all the arithmetic operations involved in computing the fraction.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\frac{1}{33}}$.
