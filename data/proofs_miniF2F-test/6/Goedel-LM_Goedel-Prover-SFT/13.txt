  Given the function \( f(x) = \cos(a_1 + x) + \frac{1}{2} \cos(a_2 + x) + \frac{1}{4} \cos(a_3 + x) + \cdots + \frac{1}{2^{n-1}} \cos(a_n + x) \), where \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) are real constants, \( x \) is a real variable, and \( f(x_1) = f(x_2) = 0 \), we need to prove that \( x_2 - x_1 = m\pi \) for some integer \( m \).
  To prove this, we start by considering the properties of the cosine function and the given conditions. Since \( f(x_1) = f(x_2) = 0 \), we can use the periodicity and properties of the cosine function to derive the necessary result.
