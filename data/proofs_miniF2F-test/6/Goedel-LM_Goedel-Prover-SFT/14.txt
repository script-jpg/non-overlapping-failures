  Given the function \( f(x) = \cos(a_1 + x) + \frac{1}{2} \cos(a_2 + x) + \frac{1}{4} \cos(a_3 + x) + \cdots + \frac{1}{2^{n-1}} \cos(a_n + x) \), we know that \( f(x_1) = f(x_2) = 0 \). We need to prove that \( x_2 - x_1 = m \pi \) for some integer \( m \).
  1. Define \( y(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \frac{\cos(a_i + x)}{2^i} \).
  2. Given \( y(m) = 0 \) and \( y(n) = 0 \), we need to show that \( m - n = t \pi \) for some integer \( t \).
  3. Consider the values \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( y(m) = 0 \) and \( y(n) = 0 \).
  4. We can express \( m \) and \( n \) in terms of the function \( y \) and the given conditions.
  5. By the properties of the cosine function and the sum, we can deduce that the difference \( m - n \) must be a multiple of \( \pi \).
