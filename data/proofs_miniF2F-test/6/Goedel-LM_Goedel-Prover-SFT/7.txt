  Given the function \( f(x) = \cos(a_1 + x) + \frac{1}{2} \cos(a_2 + x) + \frac{1}{4} \cos(a_3 + x) + \cdots + \frac{1}{2^{n-1}} \cos(a_n + x) \), we are provided with the conditions \( f(x_1) = 0 \) and \( f(x_2) = 0 \). We need to prove that \( x_2 - x_1 = m \pi \) for some integer \( m \).
  To achieve this, we can use the properties of the cosine function and the given conditions. Specifically, we know that the cosine function is periodic with period \( 2\pi \). Given the symmetry and the structure of the function, we can infer that the difference \( x_2 - x_1 \) must be a multiple of \( \pi \).
