  Given the function \( f(x) = \cos(a_1 + x) + \frac{1}{2} \cos(a_2 + x) + \frac{1}{4} \cos(a_3 + x) + \cdots + \frac{1}{2^{n-1}} \cos(a_n + x) \), we are provided with the conditions \( f(x_1) = 0 \) and \( f(x_2) = 0 \). We need to prove that \( x_2 - x_1 = m \pi \) for some integer \( m \).
  To achieve this, we use the given function and the conditions. We propose that \( x_2 - x_1 = m \pi \) and show that this can be derived from the given conditions.

  -- We propose that the difference between x_2 and x_1 is m times π.
  use 0
  -- We need to show that m - n = 0 * π, which simplifies to m = n.
