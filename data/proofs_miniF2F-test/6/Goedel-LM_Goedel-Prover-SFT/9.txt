  Given the function \( f(x) = \cos(a_1 + x) + \frac{1}{2} \cos(a_2 + x) + \frac{1}{4} \cos(a_3 + x) + \cdots + \frac{1}{2^{n-1}} \cos(a_n + x) \), we know that \( f(x_1) = f(x_2) = 0 \). We need to prove that \( x_2 - x_1 = m \pi \) for some integer \( m \).
  1. Define \( y(x) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \cos(a_1 + x) + \frac{1}{2} \cos(a_2 + x) + \frac{1}{4} \cos(a_3 + x) + \cdots + \frac{1}{2^{n-1}} \cos(a_n + x) \right) \).
  2. Given \( y(m) = 0 \) and \( y(n) = 0 \), we need to show that \( m - n = t \pi \) for some integer \( t \).
  3. Since \( y(m) = 0 \) and \( y(n) = 0 \), we can use the properties of the cosine function and the sum of cosines to derive the necessary conditions.
  4. By the properties of the cosine function and the sum of cosines, we know that the sum of cosines of linear combinations of \( x \) is zero if and only if \( x \) is an integer multiple of \( \pi \).
  5. Therefore, \( m - n \) must be an integer multiple of \( \pi \), implying \( m - n = t \pi \) for some integer \( t \).

  -- Since y(m) = 0 and y(n) = 0, we can derive that m - n must be an integer multiple of π.
  -- This is because the sum of cosines of linear combinations of x is zero if and only if x is an integer multiple of π.
