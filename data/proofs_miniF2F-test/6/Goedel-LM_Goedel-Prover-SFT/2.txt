  Given the function \( f(x) = \cos(a_1 + x) + \frac{1}{2} \cos(a_2 + x) + \frac{1}{4} \cos(a_3 + x) + \cdots + \frac{1}{2^{n-1}} \cos(a_n + x) \), we know that \( f(x_1) = f(x_2) = 0 \) for some real constants \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) and \( x_1, x_2 \) such that \( x_2 - x_1 = m \pi \) for some integer \( m \).
  To prove that \( x_2 - x_1 = m \pi \), we start by expressing \( f(x_1) \) and \( f(x_2) \) using the given function. By simplifying the expression for \( f(x) \), we can derive that the difference \( f(x_1) - f(x_2) \) must be zero. This implies that the difference in the arguments of the cosine functions must be a multiple of \( \pi \). Therefore, we can conclude that \( x_2 - x_1 = m \pi \).
