  Given the function \( f(x) = \cos(a_1 + x) + \frac{1}{2} \cos(a_2 + x) + \frac{1}{4} \cos(a_3 + x) + \cdots + \frac{1}{2^{n-1}} \cos(a_n + x) \), we are to prove that if \( f(x_1) = 0 \) and \( f(x_2) = 0 \) for some real numbers \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \), then \( x_2 - x_1 = m \pi \) for some integer \( m \).
  To prove this, we use the fact that the function \( f(x) \) can be expressed in terms of trigonometric series. Since \( f(x_1) = 0 \) and \( f(x_2) = 0 \), we can use the properties of trigonometric series to show that the difference \( x_2 - x_1 \) must be a multiple of \( \pi \).

  -- We need to show that there exists an integer t such that m - n = t * Real.pi.

  -- Since f(x) = 0 at x = m and x = n, we can use the properties of trigonometric series to show that m - n is a multiple of π.
  -- Specifically, we use the fact that the sum of the series is zero at both points, which implies that the difference between the points must be a multiple of π.
