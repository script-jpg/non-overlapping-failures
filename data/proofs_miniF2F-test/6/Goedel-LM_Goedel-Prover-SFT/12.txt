  Given the function \( f(x) = \cos(a_1 + x) + \frac{1}{2} \cos(a_2 + x) + \frac{1}{4} \cos(a_3 + x) + \cdots + \frac{1}{2^{n-1}} \cos(a_n + x) \), we know that \( f(x_1) = f(x_2) = 0 \). We need to prove that \( x_2 - x_1 = m \pi \) for some integer \( m \).
  To achieve this, we will use the properties of the cosine function and the given conditions. Specifically, we will show that the difference \( x_2 - x_1 \) must be a multiple of \( \pi \).
