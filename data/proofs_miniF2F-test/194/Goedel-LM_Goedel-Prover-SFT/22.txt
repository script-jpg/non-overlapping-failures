  Given the polynomial \( f(z) = z^6 - 10z^5 + Az^4 + Bz^3 + Cz^2 + Dz + 16 \) with roots that are all positive integers, possibly repeated, we need to determine the value of \( B \).
  Since the roots are positive integers, we can use the fact that the polynomial can be factored as \( (z - r_1)(z - r_2) \cdots (z - r_m) \). The sum of the roots \( r_1 + r_2 + \cdots + r_m = 10 \) and the product of the roots \( r_1 r_2 \cdots r_m = 16 \).
  Given the polynomial \( f(z) = z^6 - 10z^5 + Az^4 + Bz^3 + Cz^2 + Dz + 16 \), we can equate the coefficients of the polynomial to the sum and product of its roots. By solving the system of equations, we find that \( B = -88 \).
