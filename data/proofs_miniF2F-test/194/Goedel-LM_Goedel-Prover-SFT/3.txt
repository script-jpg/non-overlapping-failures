  Given the polynomial \( f(z) = z^6 - 10z^5 + Az^4 + Bz^3 + Cz^2 + Dz + 16 \) with roots being positive integers, we need to determine the value of \( B \).
  1. Substitute specific values of \( z \) into the polynomial to form a system of equations.
  2. Use the properties of the roots and the given conditions to solve for \( B \).
