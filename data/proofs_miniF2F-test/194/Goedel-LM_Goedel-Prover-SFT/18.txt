  Given the polynomial \( z^6 - 10z^5 + Az^4 + Bz^3 + Cz^2 + Dz + 16 \) with all roots being positive integers, we need to determine the value of \( B \). By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of the polynomial \( z^6 - 10z^5 + Az^4 + Bz^3 + Cz^2 + Dz + 16 \) is equal to 10. Since all roots are positive integers, the possible sets of roots are \( \{1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1\} \) and \( \{1, 1, 1, 1, 2\} \). However, since the polynomial has a constant term of 16, and the roots must be positive integers, the only feasible set is \( \{1, 1, 1, 1, 2\} \).

Given that the sum of the roots is 10, and the roots are \( \{1, 1, 1, 1, 2\} \), we can substitute these values into the polynomial to find \( B \).
