  Given the polynomial \( z^6 - 10z^5 + Az^4 + Bz^3 + Cz^2 + Dz + 16 \) with positive integer roots, we need to determine the value of \( B \). The roots are provided as \( \{1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1\} \), implying that the polynomial can be factored as \( (z - 1)^6 \). By expanding this factor and comparing coefficients, we can determine the value of \( B \).

  -- Substitute \( z = 1 \) into the polynomial and the factored form to find a relationship involving \( b \).
  have h₂ := h₁ 1 (h₀ 1)
  simp only [h₀, one_pow, sub_eq_add_neg, neg_mul, one_mul, one_pow, mul_one] at h₂
  norm_cast at h₂
  -- Substitute \( z = 2 \) into the polynomial and the factored form to find another relationship involving \( b \).
  have h₃ := h₁ 2 (h₀ 2)
  simp only [h₀, two_pow, sub_eq_add_neg, neg_mul, one_mul, one_pow, mul_one] at h₃
  norm_cast at h₃
  -- Use the relationships derived from substituting \( z = 1 \) and \( z = 2 \) to solve for \( b \).
