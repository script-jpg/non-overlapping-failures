  Given the polynomial \( f(z) = z^6 - 10z^5 + Az^4 + Bz^3 + Cz^2 + Dz + 16 \) with all roots being positive integers, we need to determine the value of \( B \). By the properties of the roots and the polynomial, we can infer that the roots are 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, and 2. This is because the polynomial can be factored as \( (z-1)^2 (z-2)^4 \). Substituting these roots into the polynomial and solving for the coefficients, we find that \( B = -88 \).
