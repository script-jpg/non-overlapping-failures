  Given the polynomial \( z^6 - 10z^5 + Az^4 + Bz^3 + Cz^2 + Dz + 16 \) with all roots being positive integers, we need to determine the value of \( B \).
  1. Substitute \( z = 1 \) into the polynomial to get \( 1 - 10 + A + B + C + D + 16 = 0 \).
  2. Substitute \( z = 2 \) into the polynomial to get \( 64 - 160 + 16A + 8B + 4C + 2D + 16 = 0 \).
  3. Substitute \( z = 3 \) into the polynomial to get \( 729 - 2430 + 81A + 27B + 9C + 3D + 16 = 0 \).
  4. Substitute \( z = 4 \) into the polynomial to get \( 4096 - 5120 + 256A + 64B + 16C + 4D + 16 = 0 \).
  5. Substitute \( z = 5 \) into the polynomial to get \( 15625 - 31250 + 1250A + 125B + 25C + 5D + 16 = 0 \).
  6. Substitute \( z = 6 \) into the polynomial to get \( 1679616 - 660660 + 60000A + 3000B + 100C + 10D + 16 = 0 \).
  From these equations, we can solve for \( B \) using linear algebra or algebraic manipulation.
