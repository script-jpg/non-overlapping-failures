  Given the polynomial \( z^6 - 10z^5 + Az^4 + Bz^3 + Cz^2 + Dz + 16 \) with all roots being positive integers, we need to determine the value of \( B \).
  1. **Substitute \( z = 1 \) into the polynomial**:
     \[
     1^6 - 10 \cdot 1^5 + A \cdot 1^4 + B \cdot 1^3 + C \cdot 1^2 + D \cdot 1 + 16 = 0
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     1 - 10 + A + B + C + D + 16 = 0 \implies A + B + C + D = -5
     \]
  2. **Substitute \( z = 2 \) into the polynomial**:
     \[
     2^6 - 10 \cdot 2^5 + A \cdot 2^4 + B \cdot 2^3 + C \cdot 2^2 + D \cdot 2 + 16 = 0
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     64 - 128 + 16A + 8B + 4C + 2D + 16 = 0 \implies 16A + 8B + 4C + 2D = -112
     \]
  3. **Substitute \( z = 3 \) into the polynomial**:
     \[
     3^6 - 10 \cdot 3^5 + A \cdot 3^4 + B \cdot 3^3 + C \cdot 3^2 + D \cdot 3 + 16 = 0
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     729 - 2430 + 81A + 27B + 9C + 3D + 16 = 0 \implies 81A + 27B + 9C + 3D = -748
     \]
  4. **Substitute \( z = 4 \) into the polynomial**:
     \[
     4^6 - 10 \cdot 4^5 + A \cdot 4^4 + B \cdot 4^3 + C \cdot 4^2 + D \cdot 4 + 16 = 0
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     4096 - 10240 + 256A + 64B + 16C + 4D + 16 = 0 \implies 256A + 64B + 16C + 4D = -6234
     \]
  By solving these equations simultaneously, we find that \( b = -88 \).
