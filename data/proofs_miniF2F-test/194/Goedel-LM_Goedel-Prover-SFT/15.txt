  Given the polynomial \( z^6 - 10z^5 + Az^4 + Bz^3 + Cz^2 + Dz + 16 \) with all roots being positive integers, we need to determine the value of \( B \).
  1. Substitute \( z = 0 \) into the polynomial to get \( 16 \).
  2. Substitute \( z = 1 \) into the polynomial to get \( 1 - 10 + A + B + C + D + 16 \).
  3. Substitute \( z = 2 \) into the polynomial to get \( 64 - 160 + 16A + 8B + 4C + 2D + 16 \).
  4. Substitute \( z = 3 \) into the polynomial to get \( 729 - 2430 + 81A + 27B + 9C + 3D + 16 \).
  5. Substitute \( z = 4 \) into the polynomial to get \( 4096 - 10240 + 256A + 64B + 16C + 4D + 16 \).
  6. Substitute \( z = 5 \) into the polynomial to get \( 15625 - 78125 + 3125A + 125B + 25C + 5D + 16 \).
  7. Substitute \( z = 6 \) into the polynomial to get \( 46656 - 172800 + 21600A + 3240B + 216C + 36D + 16 \).
  8. Simplify the equations obtained from the substitutions to form a system of linear equations.
  9. Solve the system of linear equations to find the value of \( B \).
