  Given the polynomial \( f(z) = z^6 - 10z^5 + Az^4 + Bz^3 + Cz^2 + Dz + 16 \) with integer roots, we need to determine the value of \( B \). By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of the polynomial is given by the coefficient of \( z^5 \) term (with a negative sign). Since the roots are positive integers, we can infer that the sum of the roots is \( 10 \).
