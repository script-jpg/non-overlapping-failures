  Given the polynomial \( f(z) = z^6 - 10z^5 + Az^4 + Bz^3 + Cz^2 + Dz + 16 \) with all roots being positive integers, we need to determine the value of \( B \). By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is 10, and the product of the roots is 16. Since the roots are positive integers, the only possible set of roots is \(\{1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2\}\). Substituting these roots into the polynomial and solving for \( B \) yields \( B = -88 \).
