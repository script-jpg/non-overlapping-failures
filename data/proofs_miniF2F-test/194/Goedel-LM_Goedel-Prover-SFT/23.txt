  Given the polynomial \( f(z) = z^6 - 10z^5 + Az^4 + Bz^3 + Cz^2 + Dz + 16 \) with roots being positive integers, we need to determine the value of \( B \).
  1. **Substitute \( z = 0 \) into \( f(z) \):**
     \[
     f(0) = 0^6 - 10 \cdot 0^5 + A \cdot 0^4 + B \cdot 0^3 + C \cdot 0^2 + D \cdot 0 + 16 = 16
     \]
     This implies \( 16 = 16 \), which is always true and does not provide new information.
  2. **Substitute \( z = 1 \) into \( f(z) \):**
     \[
     f(1) = 1^6 - 10 \cdot 1^5 + A \cdot 1^4 + B \cdot 1^3 + C \cdot 1^2 + D \cdot 1 + 16 = 1 - 10 + A + B + C + D + 16
     \]
     Given \( f(1) = 0 \), we have:
     \[
     1 - 10 + A + B + C + D + 16 = 0 \implies A + B + C + D = -5
     \]
  3. **Substitute \( z = 2 \) into \( f(z) \):**
     \[
     f(2) = 2^6 - 10 \cdot 2^5 + A \cdot 2^4 + B \cdot 2^3 + C \cdot 2^2 + D \cdot 2 + 16 = 64 - 320 + 16A + 8B + 4C + 2D + 16
     \]
     Given \( f(2) = 0 \), we have:
     \[
     64 - 320 + 16A + 8B + 4C + 2D + 16 = 0 \implies 16A + 8B + 4C + 2D = 320 - 64 - 16 = 240
     \]
  4. **Solve the system of equations:**
     \[
     \begin{cases}
     A + B + C + D = -5 \\
     16A + 8B + 4C + 2D = 240
     \end{cases}
     \]
     By solving these equations, we find that \( B = -88 \).
