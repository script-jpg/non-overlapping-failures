  Given the polynomial \( f(z) = z^6 - 10z^5 + Az^4 + Bz^3 + Cz^2 + Dz + 16 \) with roots that are all positive integers, we need to determine the value of \( B \). The roots are provided as \( \{2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1\} \). By substituting these roots into the polynomial and solving for the coefficients, we find that \( B = -88 \).
