  To determine the value of \( B \) in the polynomial \( z^6 - 10z^5 + Az^4 + Bz^3 + Cz^2 + Dz + 16 \) with all roots being positive integers, we need to ensure that the polynomial evaluates to zero for these roots. Given the constraints, we can deduce that the polynomial must be zero for specific values of \( z \) and use these to find \( B \).
