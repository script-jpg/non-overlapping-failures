  To determine the value of \( B \) in the polynomial \( z^6 - 10z^5 + Az^4 + Bz^3 + Cz^2 + Dz + 16 \), we need to ensure that the roots are positive integers, possibly repeated. We start by evaluating the polynomial at specific points and using the given properties of the roots to find the value of \( B \).
