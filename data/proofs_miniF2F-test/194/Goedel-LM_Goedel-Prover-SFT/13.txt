  Given the polynomial \( z^6 - 10z^5 + Az^4 + Bz^3 + Cz^2 + Dz + 16 \) with positive integer roots, we need to determine the value of \( B \). By evaluating the polynomial at specific points and using the given conditions, we can derive the value of \( B \).
  1. Evaluate the polynomial at \( z = 0 \), \( z = 1 \), \( z = -1 \), \( z = 2 \), \( z = -2 \), \( z = 3 \), \( z = -3 \), \( z = 4 \), \( z = -4 \), and \( z = 5 \).
  2. Use the given conditions to simplify and solve for \( B \).
