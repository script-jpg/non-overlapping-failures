  Given the polynomial \( f(z) = z^6 - 10z^5 + Az^4 + Bz^3 + Cz^2 + Dz + 16 \) with roots being positive integers, we need to determine the value of \( B \).
  First, we use the fact that the roots are positive integers and apply Vieta's formulas. The sum of the roots of \( f(z) \) is given by \( 10 \) (since the coefficient of \( z^5 \) is \( -10 \)). The sum of the product of the roots taken two at a time is \( A \), and the product of the roots is \( 16 \).
  Since the roots are positive integers, we can infer that the possible sets of roots are \( \{1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1\} \) or \( \{1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2\} \). However, since the polynomial has integer coefficients and the roots are positive integers, the only feasible set of roots is \( \{1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2\} \).
  Given the polynomial \( f(z) = z^6 - 10z^5 + Az^4 + Bz^3 + Cz^2 + Dz + 16 \), we can deduce that the roots are \( 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2 \). By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is \( 10 \), and the product of the roots is \( 16 \).
  To find \( B \), we need to consider the coefficients of the polynomial. Since the roots are \( 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2 \), we can express the polynomial as:
  \[ f(z) = (z - 1)^4 (z - 2)^2 \]
  Expanding this, we get:
  \[ f(z) = z^4 - 4z^3 + 6z^2 - 4z + 1 \]
  From this, we can identify the coefficients \( A = 6 \), \( B = -4 \), \( C = 1 \), and \( D = -4 \).
  Thus, the value of \( B \) is \( -4 \).
