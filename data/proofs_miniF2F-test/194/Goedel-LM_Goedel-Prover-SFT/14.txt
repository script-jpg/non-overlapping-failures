  Given the polynomial \( f(z) = z^6 - 10z^5 + Az^4 + Bz^3 + Cz^2 + Dz + 16 \) with roots being positive integers, we need to determine the value of \( B \).
  1. Substitute \( z = 0 \) into the polynomial to get \( 16 = 16 \).
  2. Substitute \( z = 1 \) into the polynomial to get \( 1 - 10 + A + B + C + D + 16 = 0 \), which simplifies to \( A + B + C + D = -9 \).
  3. Substitute \( z = 2 \) into the polynomial to get \( 64 - 80 + 16a + 8b + 4c + 2d + 16 = 0 \), which simplifies to \( 16a + 8b + 4c + 2d = -16 \).
  4. Substitute \( z = 3 \) into the polynomial to get \( 729 - 810 + 81a + 27b + 9c + 3d + 16 = 0 \), which simplifies to \( 81a + 27b + 9c + 3d = -693 \).
  5. Substitute \( z = 4 \) into the polynomial to get \( 4096 - 5120 + 256a + 64b + 16c + 4d + 16 = 0 \), which simplifies to \( 256a + 64b + 16c + 4d = -1012 \).
  6. Substitute \( z = 5 \) into the polynomial to get \( 3125 - 3125 + 625a + 125b + 25c + 5d + 16 = 0 \), which simplifies to \( 625a + 125b + 25c + 5d = -16 \).
  7. Substitute \( z = 6 \) into the polynomial to get \( 46656 - 17280 + 1296a + 216b + 36c + 6d + 16 = 0 \), which simplifies to \( 1296a + 216b + 36c + 6d = -29536 \).
  By solving these equations, we find that \( b = -88 \).
