  Given the polynomial \( f(z) = z^6 - 10z^5 + Az^4 + Bz^3 + Cz^2 + Dz + 16 \) with integer coefficients, we know that all its roots are positive integers and possibly repeated. We need to determine the value of \( B \).
  By the properties of polynomials and their roots, we can use the fact that the sum of the roots of a polynomial \( f(z) \) is given by \( -f'(0) \). Here, the sum of the roots is \( 10 \) (since \( f'(0) = -10 \)).
  To find \( B \), we need to consider the product of the roots. For a polynomial of the form \( z^6 - 10z^5 + Az^4 + Bz^3 + Cz^2 + Dz + 16 \), the product of the roots is given by the constant term (after dividing by \( z^6 \)) divided by the leading coefficient, which is \( 16 \).
  Given that all roots are positive integers and possibly repeated, we can use the fact that the sum of the roots is \( 10 \) and the product of the roots is \( 16 \). The only possible distribution of roots that satisfies these conditions is \( \{1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1\} \).
  Thus, the value of \( B \) is \( -88 \).
