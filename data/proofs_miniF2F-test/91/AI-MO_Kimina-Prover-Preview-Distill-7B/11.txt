In this Lean 4 solution, we are asked to find the units digit of the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12. These integers are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11. The product is 10395, which has a units digit of 5.

Let's analyze the Lean 4 code:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

We imported the necessary libraries and opened namespaces. The `set_option maxHeartbeats 0` allows Lean to perform more computations if needed.

Now, let's look at the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_343 : (∏ k in Finset.range 6, 2 * k + 1) % 10 = 5 := by
```

This theorem states that the product of the first 6 odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11) modulo 10 equals 5. The `Finset.range 6` represents the set {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, and `2 * k + 1` generates the odd numbers starting from 1.

Let's verify this manually:
- For k = 0: 2 * 0 + 1 = 1
- For k = 1: 2 * 1 + 1 = 3
- For k = 2: 2 * 2 + 1 = 5
- For k = 3: 2 * 3 + 1 = 7
- For k = 4: 2 * 4 + 1 = 9
- For k = 5: 2 * 5 + 1 = 11

So indeed, we're computing the product 1 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 9 * 11.

Now, let's complete the proof:

```tactics
exact rfl
```

The proof is remarkably simple because Lean can compute this directly. The `rfl` tactic is proving that the left-hand side (the product modulo 10) is definitionally equal to the right-hand side (5). Lean's computation engine can evaluate the product and take the modulo 10 automatically.

To understand why the result is 5, we can compute the product:
1 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 9 * 11 = 10395
And 10395 % 10 = 5

The key insight is that once we multiply by 5 and an odd number, the units digit becomes 5 (since 5 * odd = 5 in the units digit). After that, multiplying by 7, 9, and 11 doesn't change the fact that the units digit is 5:
5 * 7 = 35 (units digit 5)
5 * 9 = 45 (units digit 5)
5 * 11 = 55 (units digit 5)

So the units digit remains 5 throughout the entire product.

Therefore, the Lean 4 proof is complete. It proves that the units digit of the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12 is indeed 5.
