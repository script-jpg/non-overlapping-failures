In this Lean 4 proof, we're tasked with finding the units digit of the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12. 

First, we need to identify these integers. The odd integers between 0 and 12 are: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11. 

Let's compute their product:
1 * 3 = 3
3 * 5 = 15
15 * 7 = 105
105 * 9 = 945
945 * 11 = 10395

The product is 10395. The units digit of a number is its remainder when divided by 10. So we calculate 10395 mod 10. 

Since 10395 = 1039 * 10 + 5, the remainder is 5. Therefore, the units digit is 5.

In Lean 4, we formalize this as follows:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

We've imported the necessary libraries and opened namespaces to work with mathematical operations.

Now, let's define the theorem:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_343 : (∏ k in Finset.range 6, 2 * k + 1) % 10 = 5 := by
```

We have defined the theorem with the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12 represented as ∏ k in Finset.range 6, 2 * k + 1. This notation captures the sequence 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 as k ranges from 0 to 5.

Now we need to compute the actual product and find its remainder when divided by 10. We can simplify the expression directly:

```tactics
have : ∏ k in Finset.range 6, 2 * k + 1 = 10395 := by
  fin_cases Finset.range 6 <;> aesop
```

This establishes that the product is indeed 10395. The `fin_cases` tactic is expanding the product by substituting each value of k from 0 to 5, and then `aesop` is computing the arithmetic.

Now that we have the explicit value, we can compute the remainder when divided by 10:

```tactics
rw [this]
norm_num
```

The `rw` tactic substitutes 10395 for the product, and then `norm_num` calculates 10395 % 10 = 5, which completes the proof.

So the units digit of the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12 is indeed 5.
