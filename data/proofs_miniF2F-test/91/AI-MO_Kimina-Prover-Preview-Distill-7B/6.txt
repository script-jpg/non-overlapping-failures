-- We calculate the product of all odd numbers between 0 and 12.
  -- The odd numbers between 0 and 12 are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11.
  -- The product is 1 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 9 * 11 = 10395.
  -- We want to find the units digit of this product, which is equivalent to finding 10395 % 10.
  -- Clearly, the units digit is 5.
