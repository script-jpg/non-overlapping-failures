-- We want to compute the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12, then find its units digit.

  -- The odd integers between 0 and 12 are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. There are 6 numbers, so we need 6 factors.

  -- We can express this product as ∏_{k=0}^{5} (2k + 1).

  -- First, let's understand the mathematical structure. The product is:
  -- 1 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 9 × 11

  -- We can compute this step by step:
  -- 1 × 3 = 3
  -- 3 × 5 = 15 (units digit is 5)
  -- 15 × 7 = 105 (units digit is 5)
  -- 105 × 9 = 945 (units digit is 5)
  -- 945 × 11 = 10395 (units digit is 5)

  -- We observe that once we multiply by 5, the units digit remains 5 throughout the rest of the multiplications.

  -- Now, let's translate this into Lean 4. We'll compute the product directly and then take modulo 10.
