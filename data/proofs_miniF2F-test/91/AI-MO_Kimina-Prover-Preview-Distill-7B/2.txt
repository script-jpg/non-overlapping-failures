-- We want to compute the units digit of the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12
  -- The odd integers in this range are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11
  -- Their product is 1 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 9 * 11 = 10395
  -- The units digit of 10395 is 5
  -- We need to show that this is true using Lean 3

  -- First, let's think about how to represent this product in Lean
  -- The odd integers between 0 and 12 can be written as 2k + 1 where k ranges from 0 to 5
  -- So our product becomes ∏_{k=0}^5 (2k + 1)
  -- We can compute this product explicitly:
  -- k = 0: 2*0 + 1 = 1
  -- k = 1: 2*1 + 1 = 3
  -- k = 2: 2*2 + 1 = 5
  -- k = 3: 2*3 + 1 = 7
  -- k = 4: 2*4 + 1 = 9
  -- k = 5: 2*5 + 1 = 11
  -- So the product is 1 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 9 * 11 = 10395
  -- And 10395 % 10 = 5

  -- Now, let's compute the product modulo 10 directly
  -- We can compute (∏_{k=0}^5 (2k + 1)) % 10
  -- This is equivalent to computing (1 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 9 * 11) % 10
  -- We can compute this step by step:
  -- (1 * 3) % 10 = 3
  -- (3 * 5) % 10 = 15 % 10 = 5
  -- (5 * 7) % 10 = 35 % 10 = 5
  -- (5 * 9) % 10 = 45 % 10 = 5
  -- (5 * 11) % 10 = 55 % 10 = 5
  -- So indeed, the result is 5

  -- In Lean, we can compute this as follows:

  -- We need to import the necessary libraries:
  have h1 : (∏ k in Finset.range 6, 2 * k + 1) % 10 = 5 := by
    norm_num [Finset.prod_range_succ]

  -- The `norm_num` tactic is powerful enough to compute this arithmetic expression directly
  -- It will expand the product as we have done above, and compute the modulo 10
  -- The `Finset.prod_range_succ` lemma is used to expand the product over a range
  exact h1
```

The final answer is $ \boxed{5} $, which is indeed the units digit of the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12.
