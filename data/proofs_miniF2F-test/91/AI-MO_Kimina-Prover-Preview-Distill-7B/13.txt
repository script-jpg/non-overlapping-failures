-- The odd numbers between 0 and 12 are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. We want to find the units digit of their product.
  change 1 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 9 * 11 % 10 = 5
  -- We can simplify the multiplication step by step.
  change (1 * 3) * 5 * 7 * 9 * 11 % 10 = 5
  -- After multiplying the first two numbers, we get 3.
  change 3 * 5 * 7 * 9 * 11 % 10 = 5
  -- After multiplying the next two numbers, we get 15, and the units digit becomes 5.
  change 5 * 7 * 9 * 11 % 10 = 5
  -- After multiplying the next two numbers, we get 35, and the units digit becomes 5.
  change 5 * 9 * 11 % 10 = 5
  -- After multiplying the next two numbers, we get 45, and the units digit becomes 5.
  change 5 * 11 % 10 = 5
  -- After multiplying the next two numbers, we get 55, and the units digit becomes 5.
  change 5 % 10 = 5
  -- The units digit of 5 is 5.
