The final answer is $ \boxed{5} $.

# Informal Proof:
1. **Identify the odd integers between 0 and 12:**
   The odd integers between 0 and 12 are: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11.

2. **Calculate the product of these odd integers:**
   \[
   1 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 \times 9 \times 11
   \]
   Let's compute this step-by-step:
   \[
   1 \times 3 = 3
   \]
   \[
   3 \times 5 = 15
   \]
   \[
   15 \times 7 = 105
   \]
   \[
   105 \times 9 = 945
   \]
   \[
   945 \times 11 = 10395
   \]

3. **Determine the units digit of the product:**
   The units digit of a number is its remainder when divided by 10. So, we need to compute:
   \[
   10395 \bmod 10
   \]
   The remainder when 10395 is divided by 10 is 5, because the units digit of 10395 is 5.

4. **Conclusion:**
   The units digit of the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12 is 5.

\[
\boxed{5}
