-- The odd numbers between 0 and 12 are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. We want to find the units digit of their product.

  -- We can simplify the calculation by considering the units digits of these numbers:
  -- 1 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 9 × 11

  -- Let's compute step by step:
  -- (1 × 3) = 3
  -- 3 × 5 = 15 (units digit is 5)
  -- 5 × 7 = 35 (units digit is 5)
  -- 5 × 9 = 45 (units digit is 5)
  -- 5 × 11 = 55 (units digit is 5)

  -- Thus, the units digit of the product is 5.
