-- We want to find the units digit of the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12.
  -- These are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. The product is 1 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 9 * 11.
  -- Notice that 5 × any integer ends in the same digit as 5 × (units digit of the other integer).
  -- So we can track only the units digit of the product.
  -- 1 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 9 × 11 = 10395. The units digit is 5.

  -- We can approach this as follows:
  -- 1. Define the set of numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11)
  -- 2. Compute the product modulo 10
  -- 3. Show that the result is 5

  -- The odd numbers between 0 and 12 are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11
  -- Let's compute their product: 1 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 9 × 11 = 10395
  -- The units digit of 10395 is 5

  -- Formalizing in Lean:
  have h1 : (∏ k in Finset.range 6, 2 * k + 1) % 10 = 5 := by
    norm_num [Finset.prod_range_succ]

  -- The tactic `norm_num` can compute arithmetic expressions
  -- `Finset.prod_range_succ` helps evaluate finite set products over ranges
  -- Together, they allow Lean to compute the product and modulo operations
