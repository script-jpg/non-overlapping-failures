-- The odd numbers between 0 and 12 are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11.
  -- Their product is 1 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 9 * 11 = 10395.
  -- The units digit is 5.

  -- We can also compute it step by step:
  -- 1 * 3 = 3
  -- 3 * 5 = 15 (units digit is 5)
  -- 5 * 7 = 35 (units digit is 5)
  -- 5 * 9 = 45 (units digit is 5)
  -- 5 * 11 = 55 (units digit is 5)
