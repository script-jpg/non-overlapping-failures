-- We want to compute the units digit of the product of all the odd numbers between 0 and 12.
  -- The odd numbers in this range are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11.
  -- We can write the product as 1 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 9 × 11.
  -- We can compute the units digit by computing the product modulo 10.
  -- Let's compute step by step:
  -- 1 × 3 = 3 (units digit is 3)
  -- 3 × 5 = 15 (units digit is 5)
  -- 5 × 7 = 35 (units digit is 5)
  -- 5 × 9 = 45 (units digit is 5)
  -- 5 × 11 = 55 (units digit is 5)
  -- Thus, the units digit of the product is 5.

/-- What is the units digit of the product of all of the odd integers between 0 and 100? Show that it is 5.-/

  -- The odd numbers between 0 and 100 are 1, 3, 5,..., 99.
  -- We can write the product as ∏_{k=0}^{49} (2k + 1).
  -- Notice that this product includes the number 5 and the number 15 (when k = 2.
  -- So the product is divisible by 5 × 15 = 75.
  -- Thus the product is divisible by 5.
  -- The units digit of a number divisible by 5 is either 0 or 5.
  -- To determine which, we can look at the product modulo 10.
  -- Since the product is divisible by 5 and not by 10, the units digit must be 5.
  -- This is because if the product were divisible by 10, it would have a units digit of 0.
  -- But since it's not divisible by 10, it must be divisible by 5 but not by 10, so the units digit is 5.
