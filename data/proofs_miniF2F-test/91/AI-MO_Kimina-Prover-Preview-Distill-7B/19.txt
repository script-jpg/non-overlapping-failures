-- We want to compute the units digit of the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12.
  -- These integers are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11.
  -- We can express this product as: 1 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 9 * 11
  -- Notice that the product includes 5 and 3 and 7 and 1 and 9 and 11.
  -- The units digit of the product will be determined by the units digits of these numbers.
  -- Let's compute the units digit of the product of these numbers:
  -- 1 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 9 * 11 = 10395
  -- The units digit of 10395 is 5.
  -- So the units digit of the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12 is 5.

  -- Let's write the Lean proof:
  norm_num [Finset.prod_range_succ, Nat.add_comm]
