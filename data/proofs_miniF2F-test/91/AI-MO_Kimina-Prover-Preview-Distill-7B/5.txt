-- We want to show that the product of all the odd numbers between 0 and 12 is a number whose units digit is 5.
  -- We will compute the product modulo 10.
  -- First, let's identify the odd numbers in our range: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11
  -- Notice that 5 is in the list.
  -- Any product that includes 5 and other odd numbers will result in a number that is a multiple of 5.
  -- However, we need to determine if the units digit is 5 or 0.
  -- To get a units digit of 5, we need to ensure that there are an odd number of 5s in the product.
  -- Since 5 is the only multiple of 5 in our range, we need to count how many multiples of 5 appear in the product.
  -- We have: 5, 15, 25,..., 1155
  -- Let's compute the product modulo 10:
  -- 1 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 9 * 11 = 10395
  -- 10395 % 10 = 5
