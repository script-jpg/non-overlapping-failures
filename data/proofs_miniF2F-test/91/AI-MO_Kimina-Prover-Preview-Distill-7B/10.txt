-- We want to compute the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12, which are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. Then we find its units digit, which is the remainder when divided by 10.

  -- First, we compute the product step by step:
  -- 1 × 3 = 3
  -- 3 × 5 = 15, and the units digit of 15 is 5
  -- 5 × 7 = 35, and the units digit of 35 is 5
  -- 5 × 9 = 45, and the units digit of 45 is 5
  -- 5 × 11 = 55, and the units digit of 55 is 5

  -- So the units digit of the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12 is 5.
