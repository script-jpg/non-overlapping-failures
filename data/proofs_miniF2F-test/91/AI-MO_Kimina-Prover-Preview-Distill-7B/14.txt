-- We want to calculate the product of all odd numbers between 0 and 12.
  -- The odd numbers between 0 and 12 are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11.
  -- We can group them as (1 · 3 · 5) · (7 · 9 · 11).
  -- We can calculate the first group 1 · 3 · 5 = 15.
  -- We can calculate the second group 7 · 9 · 11 = 693.
  -- Then we multiply them 15 · 693 = 10395.
  -- We want to know the units digit of 10395, it is 5.
