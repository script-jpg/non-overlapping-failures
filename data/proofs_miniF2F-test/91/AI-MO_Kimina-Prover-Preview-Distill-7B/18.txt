-- We want to find the product of all the odd numbers between 0 and 12.
  -- The odd numbers between 0 and 12 are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11.
  -- Notice that 5 × 7 = 35, and 35 × 9 = 315, and 315 × 11 = 3465.
  -- So the product of all the odd numbers between 0 and 12 is 3465.
  -- Thus the units digit of the product of all the odd numbers between 0 and 12 is 5.
