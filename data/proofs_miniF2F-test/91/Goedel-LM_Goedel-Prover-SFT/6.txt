  To determine the units digit of the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12, we need to compute the product of these integers modulo 10. The odd integers in this range are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11. We will compute the product of these integers step by step and reduce modulo 10 at each step to find the units digit.
  1. Compute the product of the first two odd integers: \(1 \times 3 = 3\).
  2. Multiply the result by the next odd integer: \(3 \times 5 = 15\).
  3. Reduce 15 modulo 10: \(15 \mod 10 = 5\).
  4. Multiply the result by the next odd integer: \(5 \times 7 = 35\).
  5. Reduce 35 modulo 10: \(35 \mod 10 = 5\).
  6. Multiply the result by the next odd integer: \(5 \times 9 = 45\).
  7. Reduce 45 modulo 10: \(45 \mod 10 = 5\).
  8. Multiply the result by the next odd integer: \(5 \times 11 = 55\).
  9. Reduce 55 modulo 10: \(55 \mod 10 = 5\).
  Thus, the units digit of the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12 is 5.
