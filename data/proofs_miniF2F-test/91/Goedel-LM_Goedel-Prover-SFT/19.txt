  To determine the units digit of the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12, we need to consider the units digits of the numbers in the product. The odd integers between 0 and 12 are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11. We observe that the units digit of each number is as follows:
  - 1: 1
  - 3: 3
  - 5: 5
  - 7: 7
  - 9: 9
  - 11: 1
  The units digit of the product of these numbers is determined by the product of their units digits. Therefore, we calculate the product of the units digits:
  \[ 1 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 \times 9 \times 1 = 945 \]
  The units digit of 945 is 5. Therefore, the units digit of the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12 is 5.

  -- We use `norm_num` to compute the units digit of the product of the first 6 odd numbers.
  -- The `Finset.prod_range_succ` function is used to express the product of the first 6 odd numbers.
  norm_num [Finset.prod_range_succ, Finset.prod_range_one, Nat.mul_mod, Nat.add_mod]
  -- We use `decide` to finalize the proof by checking the units digit computation.
