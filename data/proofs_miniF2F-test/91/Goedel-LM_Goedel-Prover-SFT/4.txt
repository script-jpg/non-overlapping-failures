  To determine the units digit of the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12, we need to consider the units digits of the odd numbers involved. The odd integers in this range are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11. We will compute the product of these numbers modulo 10 to find the units digit.
  1. The units digit of 1 is 1.
  2. The units digit of 3 is 3.
  3. The units digit of 5 is 5.
  4. The units digit of 7 is 7.
  5. The units digit of 9 is 9.
  6. The units digit of 11 is 1.
  We then multiply these units digits together and find the units digit of the result:
  \[ 1 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 \times 9 \times 1 \equiv 5 \pmod{10} \]
  Thus, the units digit of the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12 is 5.
