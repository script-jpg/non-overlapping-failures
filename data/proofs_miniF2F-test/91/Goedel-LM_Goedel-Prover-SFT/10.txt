  To determine the units digit of the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12, we need to find the product of the odd numbers in this range and then determine the units digit of this product. The odd integers between 0 and 12 are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11. We will compute the product of these numbers and then find the units digit of the result.
  1. Compute the product of the first three odd numbers: \(1 \times 3 \times 5 = 15\).
  2. Compute the product of the remaining three odd numbers: \(7 \times 9 \times 11 = 693\).
  3. Multiply the results of the two products: \(15 \times 693 = 10395\).
  4. Find the units digit of 10395, which is 5.
  Thus, the units digit of the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12 is 5.
