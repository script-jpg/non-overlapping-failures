  To determine the units digit of the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12, we can focus on the units digits of the odd numbers in this range. The odd integers between 0 and 12 are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11. We observe that the units digit of each of these numbers is the following:
  - \(1 \equiv 1 \mod 10\)
  - \(3 \equiv 3 \mod 10\)
  - \(5 \equiv 5 \mod 10\)
  - \(7 \equiv 7 \mod 10\)
  - \(9 \equiv 9 \mod 10\)
  - \(11 \equiv 1 \mod 10\)
  Thus, the units digits of these numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 1. The product of these units digits modulo 10 is:
  \[1 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 \times 9 \times 1 \mod 10\]
  Calculating this product step-by-step:
  \[1 \times 3 = 3\]
  \[3 \times 5 = 15 \equiv 5 \mod 10\]
  \[5 \times 7 = 35 \equiv 5 \mod 10\]
  \[5 \times 9 = 45 \equiv 5 \mod 10\]
  \[5 \times 1 = 5 \mod 10\]
  Therefore, the units digit of the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12 is 5.
