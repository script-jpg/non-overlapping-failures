  To determine the units digit of the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12, we need to compute the product of the sequence \(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11\) and find the units digit of the result. The units digit of a product is determined by the units digits of the factors involved. We compute the units digits of the factors:
  - The units digit of \(1\) is \(1\).
  - The units digit of \(3\) is \(3\).
  - The units digit of \(5\) is \(5\).
  - The units digit of \(7\) is \(7\).
  - The units digit of \(9\) is \(9\).
  - The units digit of \(11\) is \(1\).
  Next, we multiply these units digits together:
  \[ 1 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 \times 9 \times 1 = 945 \]
  The units digit of \(945\) is \(5\). Therefore, the units digit of the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12 is \(5\).
