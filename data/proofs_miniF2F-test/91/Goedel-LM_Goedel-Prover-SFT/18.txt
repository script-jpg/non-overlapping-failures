  To determine the units digit of the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12, we start by calculating the product of these integers. The odd integers in this range are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11. We then compute the product of these integers:
  \[ 1 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 \times 9 \times 11 \]
  We simplify this product step by step:
  \[ 1 \times 3 = 3 \]
  \[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]
  \[ 15 \times 7 = 105 \]
  \[ 105 \times 9 = 945 \]
  \[ 945 \times 11 = 10395 \]
  The units digit of 10395 is 5. Therefore, the units digit of the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12 is 5.
