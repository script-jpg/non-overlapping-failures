  To determine the units digit of the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12, we need to compute the product of these integers modulo 10. The odd integers in this range are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11. We will compute the product of these integers step by step and then find the units digit of the result.
  1. Compute the product of the first two odd integers: \(1 \times 3 = 3\).
  2. Multiply the result by the next odd integer: \(3 \times 5 = 15\).
  3. Continue multiplying: \(15 \times 7 = 105\).
  4. Add the next odd integer: \(105 \times 9 = 945\).
  5. Finally, add the last odd integer: \(945 \times 11 = 10395\).
  Now, we need to find the units digit of 10395, which is 5.
