  To determine the units digit of the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12, we need to compute the product of the sequence \(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11\) and then find the units digit of this product. The units digit of the product of these numbers is determined by the units digits of the numbers involved. Specifically, the units digits of the odd numbers between 0 and 12 are \(1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11\). We compute the product of these units digits modulo 10 to find the units digit of the entire product.

  norm_num [Finset.prod_range_succ, add_mod]
  -- The units digits of the odd numbers between 0 and 12 are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11.
  -- We compute the product of these units digits modulo 10.
  -- 1 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 9 * 11 = 945
  -- The units digit of 945 is 5.
  -- Therefore, the units digit of the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12 is 5.
