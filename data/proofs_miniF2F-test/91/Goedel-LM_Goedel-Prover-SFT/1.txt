  To determine the units digit of the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12, we can focus on the units digits of the odd numbers in this range. The odd integers between 0 and 12 are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11. We observe that the units digits of these numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 1. Multiplying these units digits together, we get:
  \[ 1 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 \times 9 \times 1 = 945 \]
  The units digit of 945 is 5. Therefore, the units digit of the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12 is 5.
