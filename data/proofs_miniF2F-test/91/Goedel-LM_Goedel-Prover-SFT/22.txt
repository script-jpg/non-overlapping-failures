  To determine the units digit of the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12, we start by calculating the product of these integers. The odd integers between 0 and 12 are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11. We then compute the product of these numbers:
  \[ 1 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 \times 9 \times 11 \]
  We can simplify this product step by step:
  \[ 1 \times 3 = 3 \]
  \[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]
  \[ 15 \times 7 = 105 \]
  \[ 105 \times 9 = 945 \]
  \[ 945 \times 11 = 10395 \]
  Next, we need to find the units digit of 10395. The units digit of a number is the remainder when the number is divided by 10. Therefore, we compute:
  \[ 10395 \mod 10 \]
  Since the units digit of 10395 is 5, we conclude that the units digit of the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12 is 5.
