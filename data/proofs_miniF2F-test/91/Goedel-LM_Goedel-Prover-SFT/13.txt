  To determine the units digit of the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12, we start by calculating the product of these integers. The odd integers in this range are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11. We then compute this product and find its units digit.
  First, we calculate the product of these integers:
  \[ 1 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 \times 9 \times 11 \]
  Next, we simplify this product step by step. Notice that the product of the first two odd integers, 1 and 3, is:
  \[ 1 \times 3 = 3 \]
  The next odd integer is 5, so the product becomes:
  \[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]
  The units digit of 15 is 5. The next odd integer is 7, so the product now is:
  \[ 15 \times 7 = 105 \]
  The units digit of 105 is 5. The next odd integer is 9, so the product now is:
  \[ 105 \times 9 = 945 \]
  The units digit of 945 is 5. The next odd integer is 11, so the product now is:
  \[ 945 \times 11 = 10395 \]
  The units digit of 10395 is 5. Therefore, the units digit of the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12 is 5.

  -- The units digit of 3 is 3. The next odd integer is 5, so the product becomes 3 * 5 = 15.
  -- The units digit of 15 is 5. The next odd integer is 7, so the product becomes 15 * 7 = 105.
  -- The units digit of 105 is 5. The next odd integer is 9, so the product becomes 105 * 9 = 945.
  -- The units digit of 945 is 5. The next odd integer is 11, so the product becomes 945 * 11 = 10395.
  -- The units digit of 10395 is 5.
