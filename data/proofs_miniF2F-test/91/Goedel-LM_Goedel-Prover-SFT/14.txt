  To determine the units digit of the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12, we need to compute the product modulo 10. The odd integers in this range are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11. We will compute the product of these numbers modulo 10 and show that the result is 5.
  First, we calculate the product of the numbers:
  \[ 1 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 \times 9 \times 11 \]
  Next, we simplify this product step by step modulo 10:
  \[ 1 \times 3 = 3 \]
  \[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \equiv 5 \pmod{10} \]
  \[ 5 \times 7 = 35 \equiv 5 \pmod{10} \]
  \[ 5 \times 9 = 45 \equiv 5 \pmod{10} \]
  \[ 5 \times 11 = 55 \equiv 5 \pmod{10} \]
  Thus, the units digit of the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12 is 5.
