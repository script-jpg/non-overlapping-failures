  To determine the units digit of the product of all odd integers between 0 and 12, we need to compute the product of the first six odd numbers. The units digit of the product of these numbers is 5. We can verify this by calculating the product of the first six odd numbers and then finding its units digit.

  -- We need to compute the product of the first six odd numbers and find its units digit.
  -- The first six odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11.
  -- We can express this product as (2 * 0 + 1) * (2 * 1 + 1) * (2 * 2 + 1) *... * (2 * 5 + 1).
  -- The product of these numbers is 1 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 9 * 11.
  -- We can compute this product step by step:
  -- 1 * 3 = 3
  -- 3 * 5 = 15 (units digit 5)
  -- 5 * 7 = 35 (units digit 5)
  -- 5 * 9 = 45 (units digit 5)
  -- 5 * 11 = 55 (units digit 5)
  -- Thus, the units digit of the product of the first six odd numbers is 5.
