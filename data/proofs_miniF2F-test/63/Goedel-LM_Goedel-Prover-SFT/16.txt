 Given two geometric sequences of positive real numbers: \(6, a, b\) and \(\frac{1}{b}, a, 54\), we need to solve for \(a\). We are provided with the equations \(a^2 = 6b\) and \(a^2 = \frac{54}{b}\). To solve for \(a\), we first ensure that \(b\) is positive. Then, we simplify the given equations by clearing the denominators and solving for \(a\). We find that \(a = 3\sqrt{2}\).
