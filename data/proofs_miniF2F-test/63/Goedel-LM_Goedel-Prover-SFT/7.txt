  Given two geometric sequences of positive real numbers: \(6, a, b\) and \(\frac{1}{b}, a, 54\), we need to solve for \(a\). We are provided with the equations \(a^2 = 6b\) and \(a^2 = \frac{54}{b}\). To find \(a\), we first clear the fractions by multiplying both sides of the equations by \(b\). This gives us \(a^2 b^2 = 6b^2\) and \(a^2 b^2 = 54 b^2\). By equating the two expressions for \(a^2 b^2\), we obtain \(6b^2 = 54 b^2\). Simplifying this equation, we find \(b^2 = 9\), which implies \(b = 3\). Substituting \(b = 3\) back into the original equations, we get \(a^2 = 18\) and \(a^2 = 18\). Solving for \(a\), we find \(a = 3\sqrt{2}\).
