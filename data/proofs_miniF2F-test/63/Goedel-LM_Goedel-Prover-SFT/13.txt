 Given two geometric sequences of positive real numbers: \(6, a, b\) and \(\frac{1}{b}, a, 54\), we need to solve for \(a\). We are given the equations \(a^2 = 6b\) and \(a^2 = \frac{54}{b}\).
  First, we equate the two expressions for \(a^2\):
  \[ 6b = \frac{54}{b} \]
  Next, we solve for \(b\):
  \[ b^2 = 54 \]
  \[ b = \sqrt{54} = 3\sqrt{2} \]
  Now substituting \(b = 3\sqrt{2}\) back into the equation \(a^2 = 6b\):
  \[ a^2 = 6 \cdot 3\sqrt{2} = 18\sqrt{2} \]
  \[ a = \sqrt{18\sqrt{2}} = 3\sqrt{2} \]
  Thus, the value of \(a\) is \(3\sqrt{2}\).
