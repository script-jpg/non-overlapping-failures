  Given two geometric sequences of positive real numbers: \(6, a, b\) and \(\frac{1}{b}, a, 54\), we need to solve for \(a\). We are given the equations \(a^2 = 6b\) and \(a^2 = \frac{54}{b}\). To find \(a\), we first clear the fractions by multiplying the second equation by \(b\), resulting in \(a^2 b = 54\). Since \(a^2 = 6b\), we substitute \(a^2\) in the equation to get \(6b b = 54\), which simplifies to \(6b^2 = 54\). Dividing both sides by 6, we get \(b^2 = 9\). Taking the square root of both sides, we find \(b = 3\). Substituting \(b = 3\) back into \(a^2 = 6b\), we get \(a^2 = 18\). Taking the square root of both sides, we find \(a = 3\sqrt{2}\).
