  Given two geometric sequences of positive real numbers: \(6, a, b\) and \(\frac{1}{b}, a, 54\), we need to solve for \(a\). We are given the equations \(a^2 = 6b\) and \(a^2 = \frac{54}{b}\).
  First, we establish that \(b \neq 0\) to avoid division by zero. Then, we use the given equations to derive a relationship involving \(a\) and \(b\). By equating the two expressions for \(a^2\), we get:
  \[ 6b = \frac{54}{b} \]
  Solving for \(b\), we multiply both sides by \(b\) to clear the fraction:
  \[ 6b^2 = 54 \]
  Dividing both sides by 6, we obtain:
  \[ b^2 = 9 \]
  Taking the square root of both sides, we find:
  \[ b = 3 \text{ or } b = -3 \]
  Since \(b\) is positive, we have \(b = 3\).
  Next, we substitute \(b = 3\) back into the equation \(a^2 = 6b\):
  \[ a^2 = 6 \times 3 \]
  \[ a^2 = 18 \]
  Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
  \[ a = \sqrt{18} \]
  \[ a = 3\sqrt{2} \]
  Thus, the value of \(a\) is \(3\sqrt{2}\).
