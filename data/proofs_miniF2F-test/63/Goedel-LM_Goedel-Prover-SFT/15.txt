  Given two geometric sequences of positive real numbers: \(6, a, b\) and \(\frac{1}{b}, a, 54\), we need to solve for \(a\). We are provided with the equations \(a^2 = 6b\) and \(a^2 = \frac{54}{b}\). To find \(a\), we first ensure that \(b\) is positive. Then, we simplify the equations by eliminating the fractions and solving for \(a\). We use algebraic manipulation and the properties of real numbers to derive the value of \(a\).
