  Given two geometric sequences of positive real numbers:
  \[ 6, a, b \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1}{b}, a, 54 \]
  We need to solve for \( a \).
  1. From the first geometric sequence, we have:
  \[ a^2 = 6b \]
  2. From the second geometric sequence, we have:
  \[ a^2 = \frac{54}{b} \]
  Equating the two expressions for \( a^2 \):
  \[ 6b = \frac{54}{b} \]
  Solving for \( b \):
  \[ 6b^2 = 54 \]
  \[ b^2 = 9 \]
  \[ b = 3 \]
  Substituting \( b = 3 \) back into the equation \( a^2 = 6b \):
  \[ a^2 = 6 \times 3 \]
  \[ a^2 = 18 \]
  \[ a = 3\sqrt{2} \]
