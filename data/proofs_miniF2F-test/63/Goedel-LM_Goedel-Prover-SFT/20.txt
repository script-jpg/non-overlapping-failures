  Given two geometric sequences of positive real numbers: \(6, a, b\) and \(\frac{1}{b}, a, 54\), we need to solve for \(a\). We are given the conditions \(a^2 = 6b\) and \(a^2 = \frac{54}{b}\). To find \(a\), we first establish that \(b\) is not zero to avoid division by zero. Then, we solve the system of equations by equating the two expressions for \(a^2\) and simplifying. Finally, we verify that \(a = 3\sqrt{2}\) satisfies the original conditions.
