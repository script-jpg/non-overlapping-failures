  Given two geometric sequences of positive real numbers: \(6, a, b\) and \(\frac{1}{b}, a, 54\), we need to solve for \(a\). We are provided with the following conditions:
  1. \(a^2 = 6b\)
  2. \(a^2 = \frac{54}{b}\)
  To solve for \(a\), we start by equating the two expressions for \(a^2\):
  \[ 6b = \frac{54}{b} \]
  Next, we clear the fraction by multiplying both sides by \(b\):
  \[ 6b^2 = 54 \]
  We then solve for \(b^2\) by dividing both sides by 6:
  \[ b^2 = 9 \]
  Since \(b\) is positive, we take the positive square root:
  \[ b = 3 \]
  Substituting \(b = 3\) back into the equation \(a^2 = 6b\):
  \[ a^2 = 6 \times 3 = 18 \]
  Thus, \(a = \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}\).
