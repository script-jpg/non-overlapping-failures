 Given two geometric sequences of positive real numbers: \(6, a, b\) and \(\frac{1}{b}, a, 54\), we need to solve for \(a\) and show that it is \(3\sqrt{2}\).
  1. From the first sequence, we have \(a^2 = 6b\).
  2. From the second sequence, we have \(a^2 = \frac{54}{b}\).
  3. Equating the two expressions for \(a^2\), we get \(6b = \frac{54}{b}\).
  4. Solving for \(b\), we obtain \(b^2 = 9\), hence \(b = 3\).
  5. Substituting \(b = 3\) back into \(a^2 = 6b\), we get \(a^2 = 18\).
  6. Therefore, \(a = 3\sqrt{2}\).
