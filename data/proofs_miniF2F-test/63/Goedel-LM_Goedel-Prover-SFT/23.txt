  Given two geometric sequences of positive real numbers: \(6, a, b\) and \(\frac{1}{b}, a, 54\), we need to solve for \(a\) and show that it is \(3\sqrt{2}\).
  1. From the given conditions, we have:
     \[
     a^2 = 6b \quad \text{and} \quad a^2 = \frac{54}{b}
     \]
  2. Equating the two expressions for \(a^2\):
     \[
     6b = \frac{54}{b}
     \]
  3. Solving for \(b\):
     \[
     b^2 = 54 \implies b = \sqrt{54} = 3\sqrt{2}
     \]
  4. Substituting \(b = 3\sqrt{2}\) back into the equation \(a^2 = 6b\):
     \[
     a^2 = 6 \cdot 3\sqrt{2} = 18\sqrt{2}
     \]
  5. Since \(a\) is positive, we take the positive square root:
     \[
     a = \sqrt{18\sqrt{2}} = 3\sqrt{2}
     \]
