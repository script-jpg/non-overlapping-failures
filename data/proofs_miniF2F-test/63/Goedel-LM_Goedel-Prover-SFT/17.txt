 Given two geometric sequences of positive real numbers: \(6, a, b\) and \(\frac{1}{b}, a, 54\), we need to solve for \(a\). We are provided with the equations \(a^2 = 6b\) and \(a^2 = \frac{54}{b}\). To find \(a\), we can equate the two expressions for \(a^2\):
  \[
  6b = \frac{54}{b}
  \]
  Solving for \(b\), we get:
  \[
  b^2 = 54
  \]
  Thus, \(b = 3\sqrt{2}\) or \(b = -3\sqrt{2}\). Since \(b\) is positive, we have \(b = 3\sqrt{2}\).
  Substituting \(b = 3\sqrt{2}\) back into \(a^2 = 6b\), we get:
  \[
  a^2 = 6 \cdot 3\sqrt{2} = 18\sqrt{2}
  \]
  Therefore, \(a = 3\sqrt{2}\).
