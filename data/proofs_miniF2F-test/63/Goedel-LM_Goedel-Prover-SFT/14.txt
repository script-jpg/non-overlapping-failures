  Given two geometric sequences of positive real numbers: \(6, a, b \text{ and } \frac{1}{b}, a, 54\), we need to solve for \(a\) and show that it is \(3\sqrt{2}\).
  1. From the given sequences, we have the equations:
     \[
     a^2 = 6b \quad \text{and} \quad a^2 = \frac{54}{b}
     \]
  2. Equating the two expressions for \(a^2\):
     \[
     6b = \frac{54}{b}
     \]
  3. Solving for \(b\):
     \[
     6b^2 = 54 \implies b^2 = 9 \implies b = 3
     \]
  4. Substituting \(b = 3\) back into the equation \(a^2 = 6b\):
     \[
     a^2 = 6 \times 3 = 18 \implies a = \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}
     \]
  Thus, the value of \(a\) is \(3\sqrt{2}\).
