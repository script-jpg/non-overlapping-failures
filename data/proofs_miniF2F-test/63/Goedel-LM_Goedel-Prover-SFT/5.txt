  Given two geometric sequences of positive real numbers: \(6, a, b\) and \(\frac{1}{b}, a, 54\), we need to solve for \(a\) and show that it is \(3\sqrt{2}\).
  1. From the given conditions, we have:
     \[
     a^2 = 6b \quad \text{and} \quad a^2 = \frac{54}{b}
     \]
  2. Equating the two expressions for \(a^2\), we get:
     \[
     6b = \frac{54}{b}
     \]
  3. Solving for \(b\), we multiply both sides by \(b\) to clear the fraction:
     \[
     6b^2 = 54
     \]
  4. Dividing both sides by 6, we obtain:
     \[
     b^2 = 9
     \]
  5. Taking the square root of both sides, we find:
     \[
     b = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad b = -3
     \]
  6. Since \(b\) is positive, we have \(b = 3\).
  7. Substituting \(b = 3\) back into the equation \(a^2 = 6b\), we get:
     \[
     a^2 = 6 \times 3 = 18
     \]
  8. Taking the square root of both sides, we find:
     \[
     a = 3\sqrt{2}
     \]
