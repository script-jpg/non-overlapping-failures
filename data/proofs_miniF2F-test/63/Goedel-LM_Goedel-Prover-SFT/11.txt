  Given two geometric sequences of positive real numbers: \(6, a, b\) and \(\frac{1}{b}, a, 54\), we need to solve for \(a\). We are given the equations \(a^2 = 6b\) and \(a^2 = \frac{54}{b}\). By equating the two expressions for \(a^2\), we obtain \(6b = \frac{54}{b}\). Solving for \(b\), we find \(b^2 = 9\), so \(b = 3\) (since \(b\) is positive). Substituting \(b = 3\) back into the equation \(a^2 = 6b\), we get \(a^2 = 18\). Therefore, \(a = 3\sqrt{2}\).
