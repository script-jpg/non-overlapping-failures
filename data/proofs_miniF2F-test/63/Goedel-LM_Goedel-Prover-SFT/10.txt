  Given two geometric sequences of positive real numbers: \(6, a, b\) and \(\frac{1}{b}, a, 54\), we need to solve for \(a\) and show that it is \(3\sqrt{2}\).
  1. From the first sequence \(6, a, b\), we have the equation \(a^2 = 6b\).
  2. From the second sequence \(\frac{1}{b}, a, 54\), we have the equation \(a^2 = \frac{54}{b}\).
  3. Equating the two expressions for \(a^2\), we get \(6b = \frac{54}{b}\).
  4. Solving for \(b\), we multiply both sides by \(b\) to get \(6b^2 = 54\).
  5. Dividing both sides by 6, we obtain \(b^2 = 9\).
  6. Taking the square root of both sides, we find \(b = 3\) (since \(b > 0\)).
  7. Substituting \(b = 3\) back into the equation \(a^2 = 6b\), we get \(a^2 = 18\).
  8. Taking the square root of both sides, we find \(a = 3\sqrt{2}\).
