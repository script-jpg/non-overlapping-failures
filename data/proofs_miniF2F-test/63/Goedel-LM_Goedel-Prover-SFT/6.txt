  Given two geometric sequences of positive real numbers: \(6, a, b\) and \(\frac{1}{b}, a, 54\), we need to solve for \(a\). We are given that \(a^2 = 6b\) and \(a^2 = \frac{54}{b}\). We will show that \(a = 3\sqrt{2}\).
  First, we establish that \(b \neq 0\) because \(a\) and \(b\) are positive. We then simplify the given equations by clearing the denominators. By equating the two expressions for \(a^2\), we derive a quadratic equation in terms of \(a\). Solving this quadratic equation, we find that \(a = 3\sqrt{2}\).
