  Given two geometric sequences of positive real numbers: \(6, a, b\) and \(\frac{1}{b}, a, 54\), we need to solve for \(a\). We are given that \(a^2 = 6b\) and \(a^2 = \frac{54}{b}\). We will show that \(a = 3\sqrt{2}\).
  1. Start by equating the two expressions for \(a^2\):
     \[
     6b = \frac{54}{b}
     \]
  2. Solve for \(b\) by cross-multiplying:
     \[
     6b^2 = 54
     \]
  3. Divide both sides by 6:
     \[
     b^2 = 9
     \]
  4. Take the square root of both sides:
     \[
     b = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad b = -3
     \]
  5. Since \(b\) is positive, we have \(b = 3\).
  6. Substitute \(b = 3\) back into the equation \(a^2 = 6b\):
     \[
     a^2 = 6 \times 3 = 18
     \]
  7. Take the square root of both sides:
     \[
     a = \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}
     \]
