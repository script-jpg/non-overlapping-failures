  Given that Liberty Middle School's enrollment increased to 598 students, which is an increase of 4% over last year's enrollment, we need to determine last year's enrollment. We start by setting up the equation based on the given percentage increase.
  Let \( x \) be the number of students in the previous year. The equation representing the increase in enrollment is:
  \[ x + \frac{4}{100} \cdot x = 598 \]
  Simplifying the left-hand side, we combine the terms:
  \[ \left(1 + \frac{4}{100}\right) \cdot x = 598 \]
  This simplifies to:
  \[ \frac{104}{100} \cdot x = 598 \]
  To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of \(\frac{104}{100}\):
  \[ x = 598 \cdot \frac{100}{104} \]
  Calculating the right-hand side:
  \[ x = 598 \cdot \frac{100}{104} = 598 \cdot \frac{25}{26} = 598 \cdot 1.03448275862069 = 616.666671939101 \]
  Since \( x \) must be an integer, we round to the nearest whole number:
  \[ x = 575 \]
  Thus, last year's enrollment was 575 students.
