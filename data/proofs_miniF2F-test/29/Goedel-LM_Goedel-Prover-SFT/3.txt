  Given that Liberty Middle School's enrollment increased to 598 students, which is an increase of 4% over last year's enrollment, we need to determine last year's enrollment. Let \( x \) be last year's enrollment. The equation representing the increase is:
  \[ x + \frac{4}{100} \cdot x = 598 \]
  First, combine the terms on the left-hand side:
  \[ \left(1 + \frac{4}{100}\right) \cdot x = 598 \]
  Simplify the coefficient of \( x \):
  \[ \frac{100}{100} + \frac{4}{100} = \frac{104}{100} \]
  Thus, the equation becomes:
  \[ \frac{104}{100} \cdot x = 598 \]
  To isolate \( x \), multiply both sides by the reciprocal of \(\frac{104}{100}\):
  \[ x = 598 \cdot \frac{100}{104} \]
  Simplify the right-hand side:
  \[ x = 598 \cdot \frac{25}{26} \]
  Calculate the product:
  \[ x = 575 \]
  Therefore, last year's enrollment was 575 students.
