  Given that Liberty Middle School's enrollment increased to 598 students, which is an increase of 4% over last year's enrollment, we need to determine last year's enrollment. We start by expressing the increase mathematically:
  \[ x + \frac{4}{100} \cdot x = 598 \]
  This simplifies to:
  \[ x \left(1 + \frac{4}{100}\right) = 598 \]
  \[ x \left(\frac{100 + 4}{100}\right) = 598 \]
  \[ x \left(\frac{104}{100}\right) = 598 \]
  To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of \( \frac{104}{100} \):
  \[ x = 598 \cdot \frac{100}{104} \]
  Simplifying the right-hand side:
  \[ x = 598 \cdot \frac{100}{104} = 598 \cdot \frac{25}{26} = 575 \]
  Thus, last year's enrollment was 575 students.
