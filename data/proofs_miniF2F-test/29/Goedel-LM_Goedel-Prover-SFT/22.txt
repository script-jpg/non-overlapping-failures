  Given the increase in enrollment from Liberty Middle School over the previous year is 4%, and the current year's enrollment is 598 students, we need to determine last year's enrollment. We start by setting up the equation based on the given percentage increase. The equation for the current year's enrollment is:
  \[ \text{last year's enrollment} + \frac{4}{100} \times \text{last year's enrollment} = 598 \]
  This can be rewritten as:
  \[ \left(1 + \frac{4}{100}\right) \times \text{last year's enrollment} = 598 \]
  Simplifying the coefficient:
  \[ \frac{104}{100} \times \text{last year's enrollment} = 598 \]
  To isolate last year's enrollment, we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of \(\frac{104}{100}\):
  \[ \text{last year's enrollment} = 598 \times \frac{100}{104} \]
  Calculating the right-hand side:
  \[ \text{last year's enrollment} = 598 \times \frac{100}{104} = 598 \times \frac{25}{26} = 575 \]
  Thus, last year's enrollment was 575 students.
