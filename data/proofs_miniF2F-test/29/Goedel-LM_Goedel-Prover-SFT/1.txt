  Given that the enrollment of Liberty Middle School increased to 598 students, which is an increase of 4% over last year's enrollment, we need to determine last year's enrollment. We are given the equation \( x + \frac{4}{100}x = 598 \), where \( x \) represents last year's enrollment. To solve for \( x \), we first combine the terms involving \( x \) on the left-hand side. This simplifies to \( \frac{104}{100}x = 598 \). Next, we clear the fraction by multiplying both sides by 100, resulting in \( 104x = 59800 \). Finally, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 104, yielding \( x = 575 \).
