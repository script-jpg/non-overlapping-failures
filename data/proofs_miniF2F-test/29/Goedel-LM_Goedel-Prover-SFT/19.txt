  Given that Liberty Middle School's enrollment increased to 598 students, which is an increase of 4% over last year's enrollment, we need to determine last year's enrollment. We start with the equation representing the increase in enrollment:
  \[ x + \frac{4}{100} \cdot x = 598 \]
  First, we simplify the equation by combining like terms:
  \[ x + 0.04x = 598 \]
  \[ 1.04x = 598 \]
  Next, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.04:
  \[ x = \frac{598}{1.04} \]
  Calculating the right-hand side, we find:
  \[ x = 575 \]
  Thus, last year's enrollment was 575 students.
