  Given that Liberty Middle School's enrollment increased to 598 students, which is an increase of 4% over last year's enrollment, we need to determine last year's enrollment. Let \( x \) be last year's enrollment. According to the problem, the equation representing the increase in enrollment is:
  \[ x + \frac{4}{100}x = 598 \]
  First, we simplify the equation by combining the terms on the left-hand side:
  \[ \left(1 + \frac{4}{100}\right)x = 598 \]
  \[ \left(\frac{100}{100} + \frac{4}{100}\right)x = 598 \]
  \[ \frac{104}{100}x = 598 \]
  Next, we solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{104}{100}\):
  \[ x = 598 \times \frac{100}{104} \]
  Simplifying the right-hand side:
  \[ x = 598 \times \frac{100}{104} = 598 \times \frac{25}{26} = 598 \times 1.0625 = 635 \]
  Thus, last year's enrollment was 635 students.
