  To solve the problem, we start with the given equation:
  \[ x + \frac{4}{100} \cdot x = 598 \]
  First, we simplify the left-hand side of the equation:
  \[ x + 0.04x = 598 \]
  Combining the terms on the left-hand side, we get:
  \[ 1.04x = 598 \]
  Next, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.04:
  \[ x = \frac{598}{1.04} \]
  We perform the division:
  \[ x = 575 \]
  Thus, last year's enrollment was 575 students.
