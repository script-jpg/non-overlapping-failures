  Given that Liberty Middle School's enrollment increased to 598 students, which is an increase of 4% over last year's enrollment, we need to determine last year's enrollment. We are given the equation \( x + \frac{4}{100} \cdot x = 598 \), where \( x \) represents last year's enrollment. To solve for \( x \), we first simplify the equation by combining like terms. This results in \( \left(1 + \frac{4}{100}\right) \cdot x = 598 \). Simplifying the coefficient of \( x \), we get \( \frac{104}{100} \cdot x = 598 \). Next, we isolate \( x \) by multiplying both sides by the reciprocal of \( \frac{104}{100} \), which is \( \frac{100}{104} \). This gives us \( x = 598 \cdot \frac{100}{104} \). Simplifying the right-hand side, we find \( x = 575 \).
