  Given that Liberty Middle School's enrollment increased to 598 students, which is an increase of 4% over last year's enrollment, we need to determine last year's enrollment. Let \( x \) be last year's enrollment. The equation representing the increase is:
  \[ x + \frac{4}{100} \cdot x = 598 \]
  First, we combine the terms on the left-hand side:
  \[ \left(1 + \frac{4}{100}\right) \cdot x = 598 \]
  Simplifying the coefficient:
  \[ \frac{100 + 4}{100} \cdot x = 598 \]
  \[ \frac{104}{100} \cdot x = 598 \]
  Next, we solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides by the reciprocal of \(\frac{104}{100}\):
  \[ x = 598 \cdot \frac{100}{104} \]
  \[ x = 598 \cdot \frac{100}{104} = 598 \cdot \frac{25}{26} = 598 \cdot 1.0667 = 636.7677 \]
  Since \( x \) must be a natural number, we check the equality:
  \[ 636.7677 \approx 575 \]
  Thus, last year's enrollment was 575 students.
