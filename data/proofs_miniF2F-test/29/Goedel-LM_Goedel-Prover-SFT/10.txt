  Given that Liberty Middle School's enrollment increased to 598 students, which is an increase of 4% over last year's enrollment, we need to determine last year's enrollment. We are given the equation:
  \[ x + \frac{4}{100} x = 598 \]
  First, we simplify the equation by combining like terms:
  \[ \left(1 + \frac{4}{100}\right) x = 598 \]
  \[ \left(\frac{100 + 4}{100}\right) x = 598 \]
  \[ \frac{104}{100} x = 598 \]
  Next, we solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides by the reciprocal of \(\frac{104}{100}\):
  \[ x = 598 \times \frac{100}{104} \]
  \[ x = 598 \times \frac{25}{26} \]
  \[ x = 575 \]
  Thus, last year's enrollment was 575 students.
