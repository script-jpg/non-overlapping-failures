  Given that Liberty Middle School's enrollment increased to 598 students, which is an increase of 4% over last year's enrollment, we need to determine last year's enrollment. Let \( x \) be last year's enrollment. According to the problem, the equation representing the increase is:
  \[ x + \frac{4}{100} x = 598 \]
  First, we simplify the left-hand side of the equation:
  \[ x + 0.04x = 598 \]
  Combining the \( x \) terms, we get:
  \[ 1.04x = 598 \]
  Next, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.04:
  \[ x = \frac{598}{1.04} \]
  Performing the division, we find:
  \[ x = 575 \]
  Thus, last year's enrollment was 575 students.
