-- This is an algebra problem about finding last year's enrollment. 

  -- This year's enrollment is 598 students, which is 4% greater than last year. So if last year's enrollment was x, this year's enrollment is 1.04*x. We are given that this equals 598, so we can write the equation 1.04*x = 598, and solve for x.
