-- The problem is modeled by the equation $x + 0.04x = 598$, where $x$ is last year's enrollment.
  -- This can be rewritten as $1.04x = 598$.
  -- To solve for $x$, we can divide both sides by $1.04$ to get $x = 598 / 1.04$.

  -- Let's compute $598 / 1.04$.
  -- We can simplify this fraction by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $100$ to eliminate the decimal:
  -- $598 / 1.04 = 59800 / 104$.

  -- Since $x$ is a natural number and we've shown that $(x : ℝ) = 575$, we can conclude that $x = 575$.
