-- The enrollment increased to 598, which is 4\% more than last year. We need to find the original enrollment.
  -- Let $x$ be the enrollment last year. Then $x + 0.04x = 598$.
  -- This simplifies to $1.04x = 598$.
  -- Dividing both sides by 1.04 gives $x = \frac{598}{1.04} = 575$.
  -- Therefore, the original enrollment was 575 students.
