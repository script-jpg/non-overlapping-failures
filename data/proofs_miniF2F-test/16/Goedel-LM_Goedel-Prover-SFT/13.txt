  We need to prove that if \( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \) for each positive integer \( n \), then \( f(n) = n \).
  1. **Base Case**: For \( n = 1 \), we know \( f(1) > f(f(1)) \). Since \( f(1) \) is a positive integer, the only possible value for \( f(1) \) is 1.
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \leq n \). We need to show \( f(n+1) = n+1 \).
     - By the given condition, \( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \).
     - Since \( f(n) = n \), we have \( f(n+1) > f(n) \).
     - Given \( f(n) = n \), the only possible value for \( f(n+1) \) that satisfies \( f(n+1) > f(n) \) is \( n+1 \).
  Thus, by induction, \( f(n) = n \) for all positive integers \( n \).

  -- We use induction on n to prove that f(n) = n for all positive integers n.
  induction' hn with n hn
  -- Base case: n = 1
  -- We know f(1) > f(f(1)), and since f(1) is a positive integer, the only possible value is 1.

  -- Inductive step: Assume f(k) = k for all k ≤ n. We need to show f(n+1) = n+1.
  -- By the given condition, f(n+1) > f(f(n)).
  -- Since f(n) = n, we have f(n+1) > f(n).
  -- Given f(n) = n, the only possible value for f(n+1) that satisfies f(n+1) > f(n) is n+1.
