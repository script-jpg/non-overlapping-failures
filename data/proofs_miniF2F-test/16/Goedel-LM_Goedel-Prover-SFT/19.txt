  We need to prove that for a function \( f: \mathbb{N}^+ \to \mathbb{N}^+ \), if \( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \) for each positive integer \( n \), then \( f(n) = n \).
  1. **Base Case**: For \( n = 1 \), we have \( 0 < f(1) \).
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume \( 0 < f(n) = n \). We need to show \( 0 < f(n+1) = n+1 \).
     - By the given condition, \( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \).
     - Since \( f(n) = n \), we have \( f(n+1) > f(n) \).
     - By the inductive hypothesis, \( 0 < n \), so \( 0 < f(n) = n \).
     - Therefore, \( 0 < f(n+1) = n+1 \).
  By induction, \( f(n) = n \) for all positive integers \( n \).
