  We need to prove that for a function \( f: \mathbb{N}^{+} \to \mathbb{N}^{+} \) satisfying \( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \) for each positive integer \( n \), it follows that \( f(n) = n \) for all positive integers \( n \).
  1. **Base Case**: For \( n = 1 \), we know \( f(1) > 0 \) from the given property \( h₀ \).
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume \( f(n) = n \) holds for some positive integer \( n \). We need to show it holds for \( n + 1 \).
     - By the given property \( h₁ \), since \( n > 0 \), we have \( f(f(n)) < f(n+1) \).
     - Using the inductive hypothesis \( f(n) = n \), we get \( f(n+1) > f(n) \).
     - Since \( f(n+1) > f(n) \), and \( f(n+1) \) must be a positive integer, the only possible value for \( f(n+1) \) is \( n+1 \).
  Thus, by induction, \( f(n) = n \) for all positive integers \( n \).
