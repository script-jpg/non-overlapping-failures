  We need to prove that for a function \( f : \mathbb{N}^+ \to \mathbb{N}^+ \), if \( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \) for each positive integer \( n \), then \( f(n) = n \).
  1. **Base Case**: For \( n = 1 \), we have \( f(1) > f(f(1)) \). Since \( f \) maps positive integers to positive integers, \( f(1) \) is positive. Given \( f(1) > f(f(1)) \), it follows that \( f(1) = 1 \).
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume \( f(k) = k \) for some \( k \in \mathbb{N}^+ \). We need to show that \( f(k+1) = k+1 \).
     - By the given condition, \( f(k+1) > f(f(k)) \).
     - Since \( f(k) = k \), we have \( f(k+1) > f(k) \).
     - By the inductive hypothesis, \( f(k) = k \), so \( f(k+1) > k \).
     - Since \( f \) maps positive integers to positive integers, \( f(k+1) \) must be positive and greater than \( k \). The only positive integer that satisfies this is \( k+1 \).
  Thus, by induction, \( f(n) = n \) for all positive integers \( n \).
