  We need to prove that if \( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \) for each positive integer \( n \), then \( f(n) = n \).
  1. **Base Case**: For \( n = 1 \), we have \( f(1) = 1 \) by the given property \( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \).
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \leq n \). We need to show \( f(n+1) = n+1 \).
     - By the given property, \( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \).
     - Since \( f(n) = n \), we have \( f(n+1) > f(n) \).
     - Combining these, we get \( f(n+1) > n \).
     - By the inductive hypothesis, \( f(n) = n \), so \( f(n+1) > n \).
     - Therefore, \( f(n+1) = n+1 \).
  By induction, \( f(n) = n \) for all positive integers \( n \).
