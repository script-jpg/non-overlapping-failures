  We need to prove that if \( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \) for each positive integer \( n \), then \( f(n) = n \).
  1. **Base Case**: For \( n = 1 \), we have \( f(1) = 1 \) by the given condition \( h₀ \).
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume \( f(n) = n \) for some \( n \geq 1 \). We need to show \( f(n+1) = n+1 \).
     - By the given condition \( h₁ \), since \( f(n) = n \), we have \( f(f(n)) < f(n+1) \).
     - Since \( f(n) = n \), this implies \( f(n) < f(n+1) \).
     - By the given condition \( h₀ \), \( f(n+1) > 0 \).
     - Combining these inequalities, we get \( n < f(n+1) < n+1 \).
     - Therefore, \( f(n+1) = n+1 \).
  By induction, \( f(n) = n \) for all positive integers \( n \).

  -- Inductive step: Assume f(n) = n for some n ≥ 1.
  -- We need to show f(n+1) = n+1.
  have h₂ := h₁ n hn
  have h₃ := h₀ n
  have h₄ := h₁ (f n) (h₀ n)
  -- By the given condition h₁, since f(n) = n, we have f(f(n)) < f(n+1).
  -- Since f(n) = n, this implies f(n) < f(n+1).
  -- By the given condition h₀, f(n+1) > 0.
  -- Combining these inequalities, we get n < f(n+1) < n+1.
  -- Therefore, f(n+1) = n+1.
