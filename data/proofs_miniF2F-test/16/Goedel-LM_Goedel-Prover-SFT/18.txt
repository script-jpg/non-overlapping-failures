  We need to prove that if \( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \) for each positive integer \( n \), then \( f(n) = n \).
  1. **Base Case**: For \( n = 1 \), we have \( f(1) > f(f(1)) \). Since \( f \) maps positive integers to positive integers, \( f(1) \) and \( f(f(1)) \) are positive integers. By the given property, \( f(1) > f(f(1)) \).
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \leq n \). We need to show that \( f(n+1) = n+1 \).
     - Using the given property \( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \), substitute \( f(n) = n \) to get \( f(n+1) > f(n) \).
     - Since \( f \) maps positive integers to positive integers, \( f(n+1) \) and \( f(n) \) are positive integers.
     - By the inductive hypothesis, \( f(n) = n \), so \( f(n+1) > n \).
     - Given \( f(n+1) > f(n) \), and knowing \( f \) maps positive integers to positive integers, the only possible value for \( f(n+1) \) that satisfies both conditions is \( n+1 \).
  Thus, by induction, \( f(n) = n \) for all positive integers \( n \).
