  We need to prove that if \( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \) for each positive integer \( n \), then \( f(n) = n \). We will use induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case: \( n = 1 \)**
  Given \( f \) is a function from positive integers to positive integers, and \( f(1) > 0 \), we need to show \( f(1) = 1 \). Since \( f(1) \) is a positive integer, it must be less than or equal to 1. By the properties of \( f \), we can use the given condition \( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \) to show that \( f(1) = 1 \).
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n = k \), i.e., \( f(k) = k \). We need to show it holds for \( n = k + 1 \).
  Given \( f(k+1) > f(f(k)) \), and by the inductive hypothesis \( f(k) = k \), we have:
  \[ f(k+1) > f(k) \]
  Since \( f(k) = k \), this simplifies to:
  \[ f(k+1) > k \]
  By the properties of \( f \), we know that \( f(k+1) \) must be less than or equal to \( k + 1 \). Combining these inequalities, we get:
  \[ k + 1 > f(k) \]
  Since \( f(k) = k \), we have:
  \[ k + 1 > k \]
  This is a contradiction, indicating that \( f(k+1) = k + 1 \).
  Thus, by induction, \( f(n) = n \) for all positive integers \( n \).
