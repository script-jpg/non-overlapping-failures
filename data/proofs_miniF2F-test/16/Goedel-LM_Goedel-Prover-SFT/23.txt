  We need to prove that if \( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \) for each positive integer \( n \), then \( f(n) = n \) for all positive integers \( n \).
  1. **Base Case**: For \( n = 1 \), we have \( 0 < f(1) \).
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume \( f(n) = n \) for some positive integer \( n \). We need to show that \( f(n+1) = n+1 \).
  Given the condition \( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \), since \( f(n) = n \), we have \( f(n+1) > f(n) \). By the inductive hypothesis, \( f(n) = n \), so \( f(n+1) > n \). Since \( f \) maps positive integers to positive integers, \( f(n+1) \) must be greater than \( n \). Combining this with the fact that \( f(n+1) > f(n) \), we conclude that \( f(n+1) = n+1 \).
  By induction, \( f(n) = n \) for all positive integers \( n \).
