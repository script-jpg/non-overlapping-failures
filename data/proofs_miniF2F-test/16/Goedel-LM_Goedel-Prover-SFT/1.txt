  We need to prove that for a function \( f: \mathbb{N}^+ \to \mathbb{N}^+ \), if \( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \) for each positive integer \( n \), then \( f(n) = n \).
  1. **Base Case**: For \( n = 1 \), we have \( f(1) > f(f(1)) \). Since \( f(1) \) and \( f(f(1)) \) are positive integers, the only possible values for \( f(1) \) and \( f(f(1)) \) are 1 and 2 respectively. Thus, \( f(1) = 1 \).
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \leq n \). We need to show that \( f(n+1) = n+1 \).
     - By the given condition, \( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \).
     - Using the inductive hypothesis \( f(n) = n \), we get \( f(n+1) > f(n) \).
     - Since \( f(n+1) \) and \( f(n) \) are positive integers, the only possible value for \( f(n+1) \) is \( n+1 \).
  Thus, by induction, \( f(n) = n \) for all positive integers \( n \).

  have h₂ := h₁ 1 (by norm_num)
  have h₃ := h₁ 2 (by norm_num)
  -- Simplify the conditions to deduce the values of f(1) and f(2)
  simp at h₂ h₃
  -- Use the simplified conditions to prove the statement for all n
  have h₄ := h₁ n hn

  -- Use linear arithmetic to conclude the proof
