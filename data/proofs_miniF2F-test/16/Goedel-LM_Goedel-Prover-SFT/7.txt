  We need to prove that for a function \( f: \mathbb{N}^+ \to \mathbb{N}^+ \), if \( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \) for each positive integer \( n \), then \( f(n) = n \) for all \( n \).
  1. **Base Case**: For \( n = 1 \), we have \( f(1) > f(f(0)) \). Since \( f(0) \) is a positive integer, we can use the property of \( f \) being positive to deduce \( f(1) = 1 \).
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \leq n \). We need to show \( f(n+1) = n+1 \).
     - Using the given property \( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \), substitute \( f(n) = n \):
       \[
       f(n+1) > f(n)
       \]
     - Since \( f(n) = n \), we have:
       \[
       f(n+1) > n
       \]
     - By the inductive hypothesis, \( f(n) = n \), so:
       \[
       f(n+1) > n
       \]
     - This implies \( f(n+1) = n+1 \) by the properties of \( f \) and the fact that \( f \) is positive.
  Thus, by induction, \( f(n) = n \) for all \( n \).
