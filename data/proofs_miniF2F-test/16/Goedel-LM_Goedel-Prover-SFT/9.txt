  We need to prove that for a function \( f: \mathbb{N}^+ \to \mathbb{N}^+ \) satisfying \( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \) for all positive integers \( n \), the function \( f \) must be the identity function \( f(n) = n \).
  1. **Base Case**: For \( n = 1 \), we have \( f(1) > f(f(1)) \). Since \( f(1) \) is a positive integer, the only possible value for \( f(f(1)) \) is 1. Thus, \( f(1) = 1 \).
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume \( f(n) = n \) for some positive integer \( n \). We need to show that \( f(n+1) = n+1 \).
     - By the given condition, \( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \).
     - Using the inductive hypothesis \( f(n) = n \), we get \( f(n+1) > f(n) \).
     - Since \( f \) maps positive integers to positive integers, the only possible value for \( f(n+1) \) that is greater than \( f(n) \) and less than \( n+1 \) is \( n+1 \).
  Thus, by induction, \( f(n) = n \) for all positive integers \( n \).

  -- We will use induction on n to prove that f(n) = n for all positive integers n.

  -- Base case: n = 1
  -- We know that f(1) > f(f(1)), and since f(1) is positive, the only possible value for f(f(1)) is 1.
  -- Therefore, f(1) = 1.
