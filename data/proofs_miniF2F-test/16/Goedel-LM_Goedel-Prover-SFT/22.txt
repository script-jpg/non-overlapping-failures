  We need to prove that if \( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \) for each positive integer \( n \), then \( f(n) = n \).
  1. **Base Case**: For \( n = 1 \), we have \( f(1) = 1 \) by the given condition \( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \).
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume \( f(n) = n \) for some positive integer \( n \). We need to show that \( f(n+1) = n+1 \).
     - By the given condition, \( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \).
     - Since \( f(n) = n \), we have \( f(n+1) > f(n) \).
     - By the properties of \( f \), we know that \( f(n+1) \) must be greater than \( n \) and less than \( n+1 \).
     - Therefore, \( f(n+1) = n+1 \).
  By induction, \( f(n) = n \) for all positive integers \( n \).

  -- Inductive step: assume f(n) = n, we need to show f(n+1) = n+1.
  have h₂ : f (n + 1) > f (f n) := h₁ n hn
  -- Since f(n) = n, we have f(n+1) > n.
  have h₃ : f (f n) < f (n + 1) := h₁ (f n) (by linarith [h₀ n])
  -- By the properties of f, f(n+1) must be greater than n and less than n+1.
  have h₄ : f (n + 1) = n + 1 := by linarith [h₂, h₃]
  -- Therefore, f(n+1) = n+1.
