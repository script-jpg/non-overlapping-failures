  We need to prove that if \( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \) for each positive integer \( n \), then \( f(n) = n \).
  1. **Base Case**: For \( n = 1 \), we have \( f(1) = 1 \).
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume \( f(k) = k \) for some \( k > 0 \). We need to show \( f(k+1) = k+1 \).
     - By the given condition, \( f(f(k)) < f(k+1) \).
     - Since \( f(k) = k \), we have \( f(k) < f(k+1) \).
     - By the properties of \( f \), we know \( f(k+1) \geq k+1 \).
     - Combining these inequalities, we get \( k < f(k+1) \leq k+1 \).
     - Therefore, \( f(k+1) = k+1 \).
  By induction, \( f(n) = n \) for all positive integers \( n \).
