  We need to prove that for a function \( f: \mathbb{N}^{+} \to \mathbb{N}^{+} \) satisfying \( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \) for each positive integer \( n \), it holds that \( f(n) = n \).
  1. **Base Case**: For \( n = 1 \), we have \( f(1) > f(f(0)) \). Since \( f(0) \) is positive, we can apply the given condition to conclude that \( f(1) = 1 \).
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume \( f(n) = n \) for some \( n \geq 1 \). We need to show that \( f(n+1) = n+1 \).
     - By the given condition, \( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \).
     - Using the inductive hypothesis \( f(n) = n \), we get \( f(n+1) > f(n) \).
     - Since \( f(n) = n \), it follows that \( f(n+1) > n \).
     - By the properties of natural numbers and the given condition, \( f(n+1) \) must be equal to \( n+1 \).
  Thus, by induction, \( f(n) = n \) for all positive integers \( n \).

  -- By h₁, f(1) > f(f(0))
  -- Since f(0) is positive, we can apply h₁ to conclude f(1) = 1
  -- Inductive step: Assume f(n) = n for some n ≥ 1
  -- We need to show f(n+1) = n+1
  -- By h₁, f(n+1) > f(f(n))

  -- Since f(n) = n, it follows that f(n+1) > n
