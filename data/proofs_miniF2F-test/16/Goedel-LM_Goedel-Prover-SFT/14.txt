  We need to prove that for a function \( f: \mathbb{N}^{+} \to \mathbb{N}^{+} \), if \( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \) for each positive integer \( n \), then \( f(n) = n \).
  1. **Base Case**: For \( n = 1 \), we have \( f(1) > f(f(1)) \). Since \( f(1) \) is a positive integer, the only possible value for \( f(1) \) is 1.
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume \( f(n) = n \) for some positive integer \( n \). We need to show that \( f(n+1) = n+1 \).
     - By the given condition, \( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \).
     - Since \( f(n) = n \), we have \( f(n+1) > f(n) \).
     - By the properties of \( f \), \( f(n+1) \) must be the next positive integer after \( f(n) \), which is \( n+1 \).
  Thus, by induction, \( f(n) = n \) for all positive integers \( n \).
