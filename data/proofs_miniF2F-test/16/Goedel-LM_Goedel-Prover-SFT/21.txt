  We need to prove that for a function \( f: \mathbb{N}^+ \to \mathbb{N}^+ \) satisfying \( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \) for all positive integers \( n \), it follows that \( f(n) = n \).
  1. **Base Case**: For \( n = 1 \), we have \( f(1) > f(f(0)) \). Since \( f \) maps positive integers to positive integers, \( f(f(0)) \) must be a positive integer. The only positive integer \( n \) that satisfies \( n > f(f(0)) \) is \( n = 1 \). Thus, \( f(1) = 1 \).
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \leq n \). We need to show that \( f(n+1) = n+1 \).
     - By the given condition, \( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \).
     - Using the inductive hypothesis \( f(n) = n \), we get \( f(n+1) > f(n) \).
     - Since \( f \) maps positive integers to positive integers, \( f(n+1) \) must be a positive integer greater than \( n \).
     - The only positive integer \( n \) that satisfies \( n > f(n) \) is \( n = n+1 \). Thus, \( f(n+1) = n+1 \).
  By induction, \( f(n) = n \) for all positive integers \( n \).

  -- Base case: For n = 1, we have f(1) > f(f(0)). Since f maps positive integers to positive integers, f(f(0)) must be a positive integer. The only positive integer n that satisfies n > f(f(0)) is n = 1. Thus, f(1) = 1.
  -- Inductive step: Assume f(k) = k for all k ≤ n. We need to show that f(n+1) = n+1.
  -- By the given condition, f(n+1) > f(f(n)). Using the inductive hypothesis f(n) = n, we get f(n+1) > n.
  -- Since f maps positive integers to positive integers, f(n+1) must be a positive integer greater than n.
  -- The only positive integer n that satisfies n > f(n) is n = n+1. Thus, f(n+1) = n+1.
