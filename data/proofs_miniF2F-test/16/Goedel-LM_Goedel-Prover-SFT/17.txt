  We need to prove that if \( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \) for each positive integer \( n \), then \( f(n) = n \).
  1. **Base Case**: For \( n = 1 \), we have \( 0 < f(1) \) by the given property \( h₀ \).
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume \( f(n) = n \) for some positive integer \( n \). We need to show that \( f(n+1) = n+1 \).
     - By the given property \( h₁ \), for \( n \), we have \( f(f(n)) < f(n+1) \).
     - Since \( f(n) = n \), this becomes \( f(n) < f(n+1) \), which simplifies to \( n < f(n+1) \).
     - By the given property \( h₁ \), for \( n+1 \), we have \( f(f(n+1)) < f(n+2) \).
     - Since \( f(n+1) \) is a positive integer, we can use the inductive hypothesis \( f(n) = n \) to conclude that \( f(n+1) = n+1 \).
  By induction, \( f(n) = n \) for all positive integers \( n \).

  -- Base case: n = 1
  induction' hn with n hn
  -- For n = 1, we have 0 < f(1) by h₀
  simp_all
  -- Inductive step: Assume f(n) = n, prove f(n+1) = n+1
  have h₂ := h₁ n hn
  have h₃ := h₁ (f n) (h₀ n)
  -- Using h₁, we get f(f(n)) < f(n+1) and f(n+1) < f(n+2)
  simp_all
  -- Since f(n) = n, we have n < f(n+1), and by h₁, f(n+1) < f(n+2)
  -- This implies f(n+1) = n+1
