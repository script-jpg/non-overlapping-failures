  We need to prove that for a function \( f : \mathbb{N}^+ \to \mathbb{N}^+ \), if \( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \) for each positive integer \( n \), then \( f(n) = n \).
  1. **Base Case**: For \( n = 1 \), we have \( f(1) = 1 \) by the given property \( h₀ \).
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume \( f(n) = n \) for some positive integer \( n \). We need to show \( f(n+1) = n+1 \).
     - By the given property \( h₁ \), \( f(f(n)) < f(n+1) \).
     - Since \( f(n) = n \), we have \( f(f(n)) = f(n) = n \).
     - Therefore, \( n < f(n+1) \), which implies \( f(n+1) > n \).
     - By the given property \( h₁ \), \( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \), which simplifies to \( f(n+1) > n \).
     - Combining these inequalities, we get \( n < f(n+1) < n+1 \).
     - Since \( f(n+1) \) is a positive integer, the only possible value for \( f(n+1) \) is \( n+1 \).
  Thus, by induction, \( f(n) = n \) for all positive integers \( n \).
