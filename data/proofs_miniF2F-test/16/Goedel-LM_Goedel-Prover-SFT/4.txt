  We need to prove that for a function \( f: \mathbb{N}^+ \to \mathbb{N}^+ \), if \( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \) for each positive integer \( n \), then \( f(n) = n \).
  1. **Base Case**: For \( n = 1 \), we know \( 0 < f(1) \).
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \leq n \). We need to show \( f(n+1) = n+1 \).
     - By the given property \( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \).
     - Since \( f(n) = n \), we have \( f(n+1) > f(n) \).
     - Given \( f(n) = n \), it follows that \( f(n+1) > n \).
     - By the inductive hypothesis, \( f(n) = n \).
     - Therefore, \( f(n+1) = n+1 \).
  By induction, \( f(n) = n \) for all positive integers \( n \).

  -- Base case: when n = 1, we know 0 < f(1).
  -- Inductive step: assume f(k) = k for all k ≤ n. We need to show f(n+1) = n+1.
  -- By the given property f(n+1) > f(f(n)).
  -- Since f(n) = n, we have f(n+1) > f(n).
  -- Given f(n) = n, it follows that f(n+1) > n.
  -- By the inductive hypothesis, f(n) = n.
  -- Therefore, f(n+1) = n+1.
  -- By induction, f(n) = n for all positive integers n.
