  We need to prove that for a function \( f: \mathbb{N}^+ \to \mathbb{N}^+ \) satisfying \( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \) for all positive integers \( n \), it follows that \( f(n) = n \).
  1. **Base Case**: For \( n = 1 \), we have \( f(1) > f(f(0)) \). Since \( f(0) \) is a positive integer, \( f(f(0)) \) is also positive. By the properties of \( f \), we can deduce that \( f(1) \) must be 1, as \( f(1) \) is greater than \( f(f(0)) \) and \( f(0) \) is a positive integer.
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume \( f(n) = n \) for some positive integer \( n \). We need to show that \( f(n+1) = n+1 \).
     - By the given property \( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \), and since \( f(n) = n \), we have \( f(n+1) > f(n) \).
     - By the inductive hypothesis, \( f(n) = n \), so \( f(n+1) > n \).
     - Since \( f(n+1) \) is a positive integer and \( f(n+1) > n \), it follows that \( f(n+1) = n+1 \).
  Thus, by induction, \( f(n) = n \) for all positive integers \( n \).
