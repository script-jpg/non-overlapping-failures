  We need to prove that if \( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \) for each positive integer \( n \), then \( f(n) = n \).
  1. **Base Case**: For \( n = 1 \), we need to show \( f(1) = 1 \).
     - Consider \( f(1) \). Since \( f \) is positive, \( f(1) > 0 \).
     - Given \( f(1) > f(f(1)) \), and \( f(1) > 0 \), we can deduce \( f(1) = 1 \).
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume \( f(k) = k \) for all \( k \leq n \). We need to show \( f(n+1) = n+1 \).
     - Given \( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \), and by the inductive hypothesis \( f(n) = n \), we have \( f(n+1) > f(n) \).
     - Since \( f \) is positive, \( f(n+1) > n \).
     - Given \( f(n+1) > f(n) \), and \( f(n) = n \), we have \( f(n+1) > n \).
     - Combining these inequalities, we get \( f(n+1) = n+1 \).
  By induction, \( f(n) = n \) for all positive integers \( n \).
