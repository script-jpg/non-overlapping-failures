  We need to prove that for a function \( f: \mathbb{N}^+ \to \mathbb{N}^+ \), if \( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \) for each positive integer \( n \), then \( f(n) = n \).
  1. **Base Case**: For \( n = 1 \), we have \( f(1) > f(f(1)) \). Since \( f(1) \) is a positive integer, the only possible value for \( f(1) \) is 1.
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume \( f(n) = n \) for some \( n \geq 1 \). We need to show that \( f(n+1) = n+1 \).
     - By the given property, \( f(n+1) > f(f(n)) \).
     - Using the inductive hypothesis \( f(n) = n \), we get \( f(n+1) > f(n) \).
     - Since \( f(n) = n \), the only possible value for \( f(n+1) \) that satisfies \( f(n+1) > f(n) \) is \( n+1 \).
  Thus, by induction, \( f(n) = n \) for all positive integers \( n \).
