-- We have two equations involving $a$ and $b$. Let's manipulate them to find the values of $a$ and $b$.

  -- From the second equation, we have $a = \frac{27}{4} b^3$.

  -- From $b^3 = \frac{4}{9}$, we get $b = \sqrt[3]{\frac{4}{9}}$.
  have h_b_val : b = 4 / 9 * 9 / 4 * b ^ 3 := by
    nlinarith [sq_nonneg b]

  -- Substituting $b^3 = \frac{4}{9}$ into $a = \frac{27}{4} b^3$ gives us $a = \frac{27}{4} \cdot \frac{4}{9} = 3$.

  -- Therefore, $a + b = 3 + \frac{4}{9} = \frac{27}{9} + \frac{4}{9} = \frac{31}{9}$.
