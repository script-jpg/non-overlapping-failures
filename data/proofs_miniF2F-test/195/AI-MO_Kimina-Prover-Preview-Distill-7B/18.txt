-- We have $a^2b^3=\frac{32}{27}$ and $\frac{a}{b^3}=\frac{27}{4}$. Let's find $a+b$.

  -- First, I need to express $a+b$ in terms of $a/b^3$ and $a^2b^3$.

      _ = (a ^ 2 * b ^ 3) * (a / b ^ 3) / (a / b ^ 3) := by field_simp
      -- It's equal to $(a^2b^3)(a/b^3)/(a/b^3)$.
      _ = (32 / 27) * (27 / 4) / (27 / 4) := by rw [h₀, h₁]
      -- It's equal to $(32/27)(27/4)/(27/4)$.
      _ = 8 / 3 := by norm_num
      -- Finally, it's equal to $8/3$.

  -- Therefore, $a+b=\frac{8}{3}$.
