-- We have two equations with $a$ and $b$ real numbers:
  -- 1. $a^2b^3 = \frac{32}{27}$
  -- 2. $\frac{a}{b^3} = \frac{27}{4}$

  -- From the second equation, we can express $a$ in terms of $b$:
  -- $a = \frac{27}{4} b^3$

  -- Substituting $a = \frac{27}{4} b^3$ into the first equation:

  -- $\frac{729}{16} b^6 b^3 = \frac{32}{27}$
  -- $\frac{729}{16} b^9 = \frac{32}{27}$
  -- $b^9 = \frac{32}{27} \cdot \frac{16}{729} = \frac{512}{19683} = \frac{2^9}{3^9}$
