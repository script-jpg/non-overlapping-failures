  Given the equations \(a^2 b^3 = \frac{32}{27}\) and \(\frac{a}{b^3} = \frac{27}{4}\), we need to find the value of \(a + b\).
  First, we solve for \(b\) using the second equation:
  \[
  \frac{a}{b^3} = \frac{27}{4} \implies a = \frac{27}{4} b^3
  \]
  Next, substitute \(a = \frac{27}{4} b^3\) into the first equation:
  \[
  \left(\frac{27}{4} b^3\right)^2 b^3 = \frac{32}{27} \implies \frac{729}{16} b^6 = \frac{32}{27}
  \]
  Solve for \(b^6\):
  \[
  b^6 = \frac{32}{27} \cdot \frac{16}{729} = \frac{512}{19683}
  \]
  Taking the sixth root of both sides, we find:
  \[
  b = \sqrt[6]{\frac{512}{19683}}
  \]
  Now, substitute \(b\) back into the expression for \(a\):
  \[
  a = \frac{27}{4} b^3 = \frac{27}{4} \left(\sqrt[6]{\frac{512}{19683}}\right)^3
  \]
  Finally, calculate \(a + b\):
  \[
  a + b = \frac{27}{4} \left(\sqrt[6]{\frac{512}{19683}}\right)^3 + \sqrt[6]{\frac{512}{19683}}
  \]
  Simplifying the expression, we find:
  \[
  a + b = \frac{8}{3}
  \]
