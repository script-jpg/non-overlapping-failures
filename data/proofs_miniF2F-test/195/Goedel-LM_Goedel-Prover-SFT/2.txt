  Given the equations \( a^2 b^3 = \frac{32}{27} \) and \( \frac{a}{b^3} = \frac{27}{4} \), we need to find the value of \( a + b \).
  First, we solve for \( b \) using the second equation:
  \[ \frac{a}{b^3} = \frac{27}{4} \]
  This implies:
  \[ a = \frac{27}{4} b^3 \]
  Next, substitute \( a \) into the first equation:
  \[ \left( \frac{27}{4} b^3 \right)^2 b^3 = \frac{32}{27} \]
  Simplify the left-hand side:
  \[ \frac{27^2}{4^2} b^9 = \frac{32}{27} \]
  \[ \frac{729}{16} b^9 = \frac{32}{27} \]
  Multiply both sides by 16 to clear the fraction:
  \[ 729 b^9 = 32 \cdot 16 \]
  \[ 729 b^9 = 512 \]
  Divide both sides by 729:
  \[ b^9 = \frac{512}{729} \]
  Recognize that \( \frac{512}{729} = \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \):
  \[ b^9 = \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \]
  Take the cube root of both sides:
  \[ b = \frac{2}{3} \]
  Now, substitute \( b = \frac{2}{3} \) back into the expression for \( a \):
  \[ a = \frac{27}{4} \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^3 \]
  \[ a = \frac{27}{4} \cdot \frac{8}{27} \]
  \[ a = 2 \]
  Finally, calculate \( a + b \):
  \[ a + b = 2 + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{6}{3} + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{3} \]
  Thus, the value of \( a + b \) is \( \frac{8}{3} \).
