  Given real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a^2 b^3 = \frac{32}{27}\) and \(\frac{a}{b^3} = \frac{27}{4}\), we need to find \(a + b\) and show that it equals \(\frac{8}{3}\).
  1. From \(\frac{a}{b^3} = \frac{27}{4}\), we can derive \(a = \frac{27}{4} b^3\).
  2. Substitute \(a = \frac{27}{4} b^3\) into \(a^2 b^3 = \frac{32}{27}\):
     \[
     \left(\frac{27}{4} b^3\right)^2 b^3 = \frac{32}{27}
     \]
  3. Simplify the equation:
     \[
     \frac{729}{16} b^6 = \frac{32}{27}
     \]
  4. Multiply both sides by 16 to clear the fraction:
     \[
     729 b^6 = \frac{32 \times 16}{27}
     \]
     \[
     729 b^6 = \frac{512}{27}
     \]
  5. Simplify the right-hand side:
     \[
     729 b^6 = \frac{512}{27}
     \]
     \[
     729 b^6 = \frac{512}{27}
     \]
  6. Multiply both sides by 27 to clear the fraction:
     \[
     19845 b^6 = 512
     \]
  7. Solve for \(b^6\):
     \[
     b^6 = \frac{512}{19845}
     \]
  8. Recognize that \(b^6\) must be a power of \(b\):
     \[
     b^6 = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^6
     \]
  9. Therefore, \(b = \frac{2}{3}\).
  10. Substitute \(b = \frac{2}{3}\) back into \(a = \frac{27}{4} b^3\):
      \[
      a = \frac{27}{4} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3
      \]
      \[
      a = \frac{27}{4} \times \frac{8}{27}
      \]
      \[
      a = \frac{8}{3}
      \]
  11. Finally, calculate \(a + b\):
      \[
      a + b = \frac{8}{3} + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{10}{3}
      \]
