  Given real numbers \(a\) and \(b\), we know that \(a^2 b^3 = \frac{32}{27}\) and \(\frac{a}{b^3} = \frac{27}{4}\). We need to find \(a + b\) and show that it equals \(\frac{8}{3}\).
  First, we establish that \(b \neq 0\) to avoid division by zero. Then, we use the given equations to solve for \(a\) and \(b\). By manipulating the equations algebraically, we derive that \(a + b = \frac{8}{3}\).
