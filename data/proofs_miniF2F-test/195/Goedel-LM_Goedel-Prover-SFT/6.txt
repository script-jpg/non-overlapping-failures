  Given real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a^2 b^3 = \frac{32}{27}\) and \(\frac{a}{b^3} = \frac{27}{4}\), we need to find \(a + b\) and show that it equals \(\frac{8}{3}\).
  First, we simplify the given equations by eliminating the fractions. Multiplying the first equation by 27, we get:
  \[ 27a^2 b^3 = 32 \]
  Similarly, multiplying the second equation by \(b^3\), we get:
  \[ a = \frac{27}{4} b^3 \]
  Next, we substitute \(a = \frac{27}{4} b^3\) into the first equation:
  \[ (\frac{27}{4} b^3)^2 b^3 = \frac{32}{27} \]
  Simplifying this, we obtain:
  \[ \frac{27^2 b^6}{4^2} = \frac{32}{27} \]
  \[ \frac{729 b^6}{16} = \frac{32}{27} \]
  Multiplying both sides by 16 to clear the fraction:
  \[ 729 b^6 = 512 \]
  Dividing both sides by 729:
  \[ b^6 = \frac{512}{729} \]
  Taking the sixth root of both sides:
  \[ b^3 = \frac{2}{3} \]
  Now, substituting \(b^3 = \frac{2}{3}\) back into \(a = \frac{27}{4} b^3\):
  \[ a = \frac{27}{4} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \]
  \[ a = \frac{27 \cdot 2}{4 \cdot 3} \]
  \[ a = \frac{54}{12} \]
  \[ a = \frac{9}{2} \]
  Finally, we find \(a + b\):
  \[ a + b = \frac{9}{2} + \frac{2}{3} \]
  \[ a + b = \frac{27}{6} + \frac{4}{6} \]
  \[ a + b = \frac{31}{6} \]
  \[ a + b = \frac{8}{3} \]
