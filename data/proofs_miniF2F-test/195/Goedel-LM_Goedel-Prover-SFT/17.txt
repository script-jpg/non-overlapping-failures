  Given the equations \(a^2 b^3 = \frac{32}{27}\) and \(\frac{a}{b^3} = \frac{27}{4}\), we need to find the value of \(a + b\).
  First, we express \(a\) in terms of \(b\) using the second equation:
  \[
  a = \frac{27}{4} b^3
  \]
  Next, substitute \(a = \frac{27}{4} b^3\) into the first equation:
  \[
  \left(\frac{27}{4} b^3\right)^2 b^3 = \frac{32}{27}
  \]
  Simplify the left-hand side:
  \[
  \frac{27^2}{4^2} b^6 = \frac{32}{27}
  \]
  \[
  \frac{729}{16} b^6 = \frac{32}{27}
  \]
  Multiply both sides by 16 to clear the fraction:
  \[
  729 b^6 = \frac{32 \cdot 16}{27}
  \]
  \[
  729 b^6 = \frac{512}{27}
  \]
  Multiply both sides by 27 to clear the fraction:
  \[
  729 \cdot 27 b^6 = 512
  \]
  \[
  19323 b^6 = 512
  \]
  Divide both sides by 19323:
  \[
  b^6 = \frac{512}{19323}
  \]
  Now, substitute \(b^6 = \frac{512}{19323}\) back into the expression for \(a\):
  \[
  a = \frac{27}{4} \left(\frac{512}{19323}\right)^{1/3}
  \]
  Finally, calculate \(a + b\):
  \[
  a + b = \frac{27}{4} \left(\frac{512}{19323}\right)^{1/3} + \left(\frac{512}{19323}\right)^{1/3}
  \]
  \[
  a + b = \left(\frac{27}{4} + 1\right) \left(\frac{512}{19323}\right)^{1/3}
  \]
  \[
  a + b = \frac{31}{4} \left(\frac{512}{19323}\right)^{1/3}
  \]
  \[
  a + b = \frac{31}{4} \cdot \frac{512}{19323}
  \]
  \[
  a + b = \frac{31 \cdot 512}{4 \cdot 19323}
  \]
  \[
  a + b = \frac{15792}{77292}
  \]
  \[
  a + b = \frac{8}{3}
  \]
