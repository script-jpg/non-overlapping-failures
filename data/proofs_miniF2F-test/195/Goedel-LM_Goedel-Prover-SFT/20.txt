  Given real numbers \(a\) and \(b\), we know that \(a^2 b^3 = \frac{32}{27}\) and \(\frac{a}{b^3} = \frac{27}{4}\). We need to find \(a + b\).
  First, we express \(a\) in terms of \(b\) using the second equation:
  \[ a = \frac{27}{4} b^3 \]
  Next, substitute this expression for \(a\) into the first equation:
  \[ \left(\frac{27}{4} b^3\right)^2 b^3 = \frac{32}{27} \]
  Simplify the left-hand side:
  \[ \frac{27^2}{4^2} b^6 = \frac{32}{27} \]
  \[ \frac{729}{16} b^6 = \frac{32}{27} \]
  Solve for \(b^6\):
  \[ b^6 = \frac{32}{27} \cdot \frac{16}{729} \]
  \[ b^6 = \frac{512}{19683} \]
  Now, solve for \(b^3\):
  \[ b^3 = \sqrt[3]{\frac{512}{19683}} \]
  \[ b^3 = \frac{8}{27} \]
  Substitute \(b^3 = \frac{8}{27}\) back into the expression for \(a\):
  \[ a = \frac{27}{4} \left(\frac{8}{27}\right)^2 \]
  \[ a = \frac{27}{4} \cdot \frac{64}{729} \]
  \[ a = \frac{16}{27} \]
  Finally, calculate \(a + b\):
  \[ a + b = \frac{16}{27} + \frac{8}{27} \]
  \[ a + b = \frac{24}{27} \]
  \[ a + b = \frac{8}{3} \]
