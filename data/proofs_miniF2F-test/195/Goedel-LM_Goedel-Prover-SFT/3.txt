  Given the equations \( a^2 b^3 = \frac{32}{27} \) and \( \frac{a}{b^3} = \frac{27}{4} \), we need to find the value of \( a + b \).
  First, we simplify the given equations by eliminating the fractions. Multiplying the first equation by \( b^3 \) and the second equation by \( 27 \) gives:
  \[ a^2 b^6 = 32 \]
  \[ a = \frac{27}{4} b^3 \]
  Next, we substitute \( a = \frac{27}{4} b^3 \) into the first equation:
  \[ \left( \frac{27}{4} b^3 \right)^2 b^6 = 32 \]
  \[ \frac{729}{16} b^9 = 32 \]
  \[ b^9 = \frac{32 \cdot 16}{729} \]
  \[ b^9 = \frac{512}{729} \]
  \[ b^3 = \frac{8}{9} \]
  Now, substituting \( b^3 = \frac{8}{9} \) back into \( a = \frac{27}{4} b^3 \):
  \[ a = \frac{27}{4} \cdot \frac{8}{9} \]
  \[ a = \frac{27 \cdot 8}{4 \cdot 9} \]
  \[ a = \frac{216}{36} \]
  \[ a = \frac{3}{1} \]
  \[ a = 3 \]
  Finally, we add \( a \) and \( b \):
  \[ a + b = 3 + \frac{8}{3} \]
  \[ a + b = \frac{9}{3} + \frac{8}{3} \]
  \[ a + b = \frac{17}{3} \]
  However, this result does not match the expected \( \frac{8}{3} \). Let's re-evaluate the steps to ensure correctness.
