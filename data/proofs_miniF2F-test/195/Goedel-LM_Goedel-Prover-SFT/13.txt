  Given real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a^2 b^3 = \frac{32}{27}\) and \(\frac{a}{b^3} = \frac{27}{4}\), we need to show that \(a + b = \frac{8}{3}\).
  First, we solve for \(a\) in terms of \(b\) using the second equation:
  \[
  \frac{a}{b^3} = \frac{27}{4} \implies a = \frac{27}{4} b^3
  \]
  Next, substitute \(a = \frac{27}{4} b^3\) into the first equation:
  \[
  \left(\frac{27}{4} b^3\right)^2 b^3 = \frac{32}{27}
  \]
  Simplify the equation:
  \[
  \frac{27^2}{4^2} b^6 = \frac{32}{27}
  \]
  \[
  \frac{729}{16} b^6 = \frac{32}{27}
  \]
  Multiply both sides by 16 to clear the fraction:
  \[
  729 b^6 = \frac{32 \cdot 16}{27}
  \]
  \[
  729 b^6 = \frac{512}{27}
  \]
  Multiply both sides by 27 to clear the fraction:
  \[
  729 b^6 = 512
  \]
  Divide both sides by 729:
  \[
  b^6 = \frac{512}{729}
  \]
  Recognize that \(\frac{512}{729} = \frac{2^9}{3^6}\), so:
  \[
  b^6 = \frac{2^9}{3^6}
  \]
  Taking the sixth root of both sides:
  \[
  b = \frac{2^3}{3^2} = \frac{8}{9}
  \]
  Now, substitute \(b = \frac{8}{9}\) back into \(a = \frac{27}{4} b^3\):
  \[
  a = \frac{27}{4} \left(\frac{8}{9}\right)^3 = \frac{27}{4} \cdot \frac{512}{729} = \frac{27 \cdot 512}{4 \cdot 729} = \frac{14016}{2916} = \frac{11}{3}
  \]
  Finally, calculate \(a + b\):
  \[
  a + b = \frac{11}{3} + \frac{8}{9} = \frac{33}{9} + \frac{8}{9} = \frac{41}{9}
  \]
  However, this result does not match the expected \(\frac{8}{3}\). Let's re-evaluate the steps to ensure correctness.
