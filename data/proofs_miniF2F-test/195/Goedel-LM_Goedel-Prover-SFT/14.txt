  Given the equations \(a^2 b^3 = \frac{32}{27}\) and \(\frac{a}{b^3} = \frac{27}{4}\), we need to find the value of \(a + b\).
  First, solve for \(a\) in terms of \(b\) from the second equation:
  \[
  \frac{a}{b^3} = \frac{27}{4} \implies a = \frac{27}{4} b^3
  \]
  Next, substitute \(a = \frac{27}{4} b^3\) into the first equation:
  \[
  \left(\frac{27}{4} b^3\right)^2 b^3 = \frac{32}{27}
  \]
  Simplify the equation:
  \[
  \frac{729}{16} b^9 = \frac{32}{27}
  \]
  Solve for \(b^9\):
  \[
  b^9 = \frac{32}{27} \cdot \frac{16}{729} = \frac{512}{19683}
  \]
  Now, solve for \(b\):
  \[
  b = \sqrt[9]{\frac{512}{19683}}
  \]
  Finally, substitute \(b\) back into \(a = \frac{27}{4} b^3\) to find \(a\):
  \[
  a = \frac{27}{4} \left(\sqrt[9]{\frac{512}{19683}}\right)^3
  \]
  Finally, calculate \(a + b\):
  \[
  a + b = \frac{27}{4} \left(\sqrt[9]{\frac{512}{19683}}\right)^3 + \sqrt[9]{\frac{512}{19683}}
  \]
  Simplify and find that:
  \[
  a + b = \frac{8}{3}
  \]
