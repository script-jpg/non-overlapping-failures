  Given real numbers \(a\) and \(b\), we know that \(a^2 b^3 = \frac{32}{27}\) and \(\frac{a}{b^3} = \frac{27}{4}\). We need to find \(a + b\) and show that it equals \(\frac{8}{3}\).
  First, we establish that \(b \neq 0\) to avoid division by zero. Then, we use the given equations to derive the value of \(a + b\).
  1. From \(\frac{a}{b^3} = \frac{27}{4}\), we can write \(a = \frac{27}{4} b^3\).
  2. Substitute \(a = \frac{27}{4} b^3\) into \(a^2 b^3 = \frac{32}{27}\):
     \[
     \left(\frac{27}{4} b^3\right)^2 b^3 = \frac{32}{27}
     \]
  3. Simplify the equation:
     \[
     \frac{729}{16} b^6 = \frac{32}{27}
     \]
  4. Solve for \(b^6\):
     \[
     b^6 = \frac{32}{27} \cdot \frac{16}{729} = \frac{512}{19683}
     \]
  5. Since \(b^6 = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^6\), we have \(b = \frac{2}{3}\).
  6. Substitute \(b = \frac{2}{3}\) back into \(a = \frac{27}{4} b^3\):
     \[
     a = \frac{27}{4} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 = \frac{27}{4} \cdot \frac{8}{27} = 2
     \]
  7. Finally, calculate \(a + b\):
     \[
     a + b = 2 + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{6}{3} + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{3}
     \]
