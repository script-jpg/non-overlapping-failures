  Given real numbers \(a\) and \(b\), we know that \(a^2 b^3 = \frac{32}{27}\) and \(\frac{a}{b^3} = \frac{27}{4}\). We need to find the value of \(a + b\).
  First, we establish that \(b \neq 0\) to avoid division by zero. Then, we simplify the given equations by eliminating the fractions. By manipulating these equations algebraically, we derive a quadratic equation in terms of \(a\) and \(b\). Solving this quadratic equation, we find that \(a + b = \frac{8}{3}\).
