  Given real numbers \(a\) and \(b\), we are provided with the equations \(a^2b^3 = \frac{32}{27}\) and \(\frac{a}{b^3} = \frac{27}{4}\). We need to find \(a + b\) and show that it equals \(\frac{8}{3}\).
  First, we solve for \(a\) and \(b\) using the given equations. From \(\frac{a}{b^3} = \frac{27}{4}\), we can express \(a\) as \(a = \frac{27}{4} b^3\). Substituting this into the first equation \(a^2b^3 = \frac{32}{27}\), we get:
  \[
  \left(\frac{27}{4} b^3\right)^2 b^3 = \frac{32}{27}
  \]
  Simplifying, we have:
  \[
  \frac{729}{16} b^6 = \frac{32}{27}
  \]
  Solving for \(b^6\), we get:
  \[
  b^6 = \frac{32 \cdot 16}{729} = \frac{512}{729}
  \]
  Next, we solve for \(b^3\) by taking the sixth root of both sides:
  \[
  b^3 = \sqrt[6]{\frac{512}{729}} = \frac{4}{3}
  \]
  Now, substituting \(b^3 = \frac{4}{3}\) back into \(a = \frac{27}{4} b^3\), we get:
  \[
  a = \frac{27}{4} \cdot \frac{4}{3} = 9
  \]
  Finally, we calculate \(a + b\):
  \[
  a + b = 9 + \frac{4}{3} = \frac{27}{3} + \frac{4}{3} = \frac{31}{3}
  \]
  However, this result does not match the expected \(\frac{8}{3}\). Let's re-evaluate the steps to ensure accuracy.
