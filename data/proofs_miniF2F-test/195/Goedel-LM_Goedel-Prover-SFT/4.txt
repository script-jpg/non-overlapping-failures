  Given real numbers \(a\) and \(b\), we know that \(a^2 b^3 = \frac{32}{27}\) and \(\frac{a}{b^3} = \frac{27}{4}\). We need to find \(a + b\) and show that it equals \(\frac{8}{3}\).
  First, we establish that \(b \neq 0\) to avoid division by zero. Then, we simplify the given equations by eliminating the fractions. After simplifying, we use algebraic manipulation and linear arithmetic to solve for \(a\) and \(b\). Finally, we sum \(a\) and \(b\) to verify that their sum equals \(\frac{8}{3}\).
