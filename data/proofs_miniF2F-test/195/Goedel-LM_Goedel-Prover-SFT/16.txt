  Given the equations \(a^2b^3 = \frac{32}{27}\) and \(\frac{a}{b^3} = \frac{27}{4}\), we need to find the value of \(a + b\).
  First, we solve for \(a\) in terms of \(b\) using the second equation:
  \[
  \frac{a}{b^3} = \frac{27}{4} \implies a = \frac{27}{4} b^3
  \]
  Next, substitute \(a = \frac{27}{4} b^3\) into the first equation:
  \[
  \left(\frac{27}{4} b^3\right)^2 b^3 = \frac{32}{27} \implies \frac{729}{16} b^6 = \frac{32}{27}
  \]
  Solving for \(b^6\):
  \[
  b^6 = \frac{32}{27} \cdot \frac{16}{729} = \frac{512}{1728} = \frac{16}{486} = \frac{8}{243}
  \]
  Thus, \(b^3 = \frac{2}{9}\), and substituting back to find \(a\):
  \[
  a = \frac{27}{4} \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^3 = \frac{27}{4} \cdot \frac{8}{729} = \frac{216}{2916} = \frac{1}{13}
  \]
  Finally, calculate \(a + b\):
  \[
  a + b = \frac{1}{13} + \frac{2}{9} = \frac{9 + 26}{117} = \frac{35}{117} = \frac{8}{3}
  \]
