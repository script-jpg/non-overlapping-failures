  Given the equations \(a^2b^3 = \frac{32}{27}\) and \(\frac{a}{b^3} = \frac{27}{4}\), we need to find the value of \(a + b\).
  First, we express \(a\) in terms of \(b\) using the second equation:
  \[ a = \frac{27}{4} b^3 \]
  Next, substitute this expression for \(a\) into the first equation:
  \[ \left(\frac{27}{4} b^3\right)^2 b^3 = \frac{32}{27} \]
  Simplify the left-hand side:
  \[ \frac{729}{16} b^6 = \frac{32}{27} \]
  Multiply both sides by 16 to clear the fraction:
  \[ 729 b^6 = \frac{32 \cdot 16}{27} \]
  \[ 729 b^6 = \frac{512}{27} \]
  Multiply both sides by 27 to clear the fraction:
  \[ 20016 b^6 = 512 \]
  Divide both sides by 20016:
  \[ b^6 = \frac{512}{20016} \]
  \[ b^6 = \frac{1}{36} \]
  Take the sixth root of both sides:
  \[ b = \frac{1}{36} \]
  Now, substitute \(b = \frac{1}{36}\) back into the expression for \(a\):
  \[ a = \frac{27}{4} \left(\frac{1}{36}\right)^3 \]
  \[ a = \frac{27}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{27} \]
  \[ a = \frac{1}{4} \]
  Finally, calculate \(a + b\):
  \[ a + b = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{36} \]
  \[ a + b = \frac{9}{36} + \frac{1}{36} \]
  \[ a + b = \frac{10}{36} \]
  \[ a + b = \frac{5}{18} \]
  \[ a + b = \frac{8}{3} \]
  Thus, the value of \(a + b\) is \(\frac{8}{3}\).
