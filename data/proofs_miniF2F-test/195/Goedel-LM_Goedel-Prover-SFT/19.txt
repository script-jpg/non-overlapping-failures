  Given the equations \(a^2 b^3 = \frac{32}{27}\) and \(\frac{a}{b^3} = \frac{27}{4}\), we need to find the value of \(a + b\).
  First, we solve for \(b\) using the second equation:
  \[
  \frac{a}{b^3} = \frac{27}{4} \implies b^3 = \frac{4a}{27}
  \]
  Next, we substitute \(b^3\) into the first equation:
  \[
  a^2 \left(\frac{4a}{27}\right) = \frac{32}{27} \implies \frac{4a^3}{27} = \frac{32}{27} \implies 4a^3 = 32 \implies a^3 = 8 \implies a = 2
  \]
  Now, we substitute \(a = 2\) back into the expression for \(b\):
  \[
  b^3 = \frac{4 \cdot 2}{27} = \frac{8}{27} \implies b = \frac{2}{3}
  \]
  Finally, we calculate \(a + b\):
  \[
  a + b = 2 + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{6}{3} + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{3}
  \]
