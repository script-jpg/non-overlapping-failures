  Given real numbers \(a\) and \(b\), we are provided with the equations \(a^2 b^3 = \frac{32}{27}\) and \(\frac{a}{b^3} = \frac{27}{4}\). We need to show that \(a + b = \frac{8}{3}\).
  First, we solve for \(a\) in terms of \(b\) using the second equation:
  \[
  \frac{a}{b^3} = \frac{27}{4} \implies a = \frac{27}{4} b^3
  \]
  Next, substitute \(a = \frac{27}{4} b^3\) into the first equation:
  \[
  \left(\frac{27}{4} b^3\right)^2 b^3 = \frac{32}{27} \implies \frac{729}{16} b^6 = \frac{32}{27}
  \]
  Solving for \(b^6\):
  \[
  b^6 = \frac{32}{27} \cdot \frac{16}{729} = \frac{512}{19683}
  \]
  Taking the sixth root of both sides:
  \[
  b^3 = \sqrt[6]{\frac{512}{19683}} = \frac{4}{9}
  \]
  Thus, \(b^3 = \frac{4}{9}\). Solving for \(b\):
  \[
  b = \sqrt[3]{\frac{4}{9}} = \frac{2}{3}
  \]
  Substitute \(b = \frac{2}{3}\) back into \(a = \frac{27}{4} b^3\):
  \[
  a = \frac{27}{4} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 = \frac{27}{4} \cdot \frac{8}{27} = 2
  \]
  Finally, calculate \(a + b\):
  \[
  a + b = 2 + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{6}{3} + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{3}
  \]
