  Given real numbers \(a\) and \(b\), we know that \(a^2 b^3 = \frac{32}{27}\) and \(\frac{a}{b^3} = \frac{27}{4}\). We need to find the value of \(a + b\) and show that it is \(\frac{8}{3}\).
  First, we use the given equations to express \(a\) in terms of \(b\). From \(\frac{a}{b^3} = \frac{27}{4}\), we can write:
  \[ a = \frac{27}{4} b^3 \]
  Next, substitute \(a = \frac{27}{4} b^3\) into the equation \(a^2 b^3 = \frac{32}{27}\):
  \[ \left(\frac{27}{4} b^3\right)^2 b^3 = \frac{32}{27} \]
  Simplify the equation:
  \[ \frac{729}{16} b^6 = \frac{32}{27} \]
  Solve for \(b^6\):
  \[ b^6 = \frac{32}{27} \cdot \frac{16}{729} = \frac{512}{19683} \]
  Since \(b^6 = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^6\), we have:
  \[ b = \frac{2}{3} \]
  Now, substitute \(b = \frac{2}{3}\) back into \(a = \frac{27}{4} b^3\):
  \[ a = \frac{27}{4} \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 = \frac{27}{4} \cdot \frac{8}{27} = 2 \]
  Finally, calculate \(a + b\):
  \[ a + b = 2 + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{6}{3} + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{3} \]
