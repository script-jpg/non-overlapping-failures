-- The point A is the intersection of the lines $3y = x$ and $2x + 5y = 11$.
  -- Substitute $x = 3y$ into $2x + 5y = 11$ to get $2(3y) + 5y = 11$.
  have : 2 * (3 * y) + 5 * y = 11 := by rw [← h₀, h₁]
  -- Simplifying the equation gives $11y = 11$, so $y = 1$.
  have hy : y = 1 := by linarith
  -- Substituting $y = 1$ into $x = 3y$ gives $x = 3$.
  have hx : x = 3 := by rw [hy] at h₀; linarith
  -- Therefore, the sum of the coordinates of point $A$ is $x + y = 3 + 1 = 4$.
