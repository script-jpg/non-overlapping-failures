-- The point $A$ is the intersection of $3y = x$ and $2x + 5y = 11$.

  -- The solution is to solve the system of equations given by $3y = x$ and $2x + 5y = 11$.

  -- Substitute $x = 3y$ into $2x + 5y = 11$ to get $2(3y) + 5y = 11$.

  have subst : 2 * (3 * y) + 5 * y = 11 := by rw [← h₀] at h₁; exact h₁

  -- Simplify the equation to get $11y = 11$.

  have eq : 11 * y = 11 := by linarith

  -- Solve for $y$ to get $y = 1$.

  have y_val : y = 1 := by linarith

  -- Substitute $y = 1$ into $x = 3y$ to get $x = 3$.

  have x_val : x = 3 := by rw [y_val] at h₀; linarith

  -- Therefore, the sum of the coordinates of point $A$ is $x + y = 3 + 1 = 4$.

  rw [x_val, y_val]; linarith
