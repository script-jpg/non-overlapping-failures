-- The point $A$ is the intersection of the line $3y = x$ and the line $2x + 5y = 11$.

  -- Let us denote the coordinates of $A$ as $(x, y)$.

  -- Substituting $x = 3y$ from the first equation into the second equation,

  have : 2 * (3 * y) + 5 * y = 11 := by rwa [← h₀]

  -- and simplifying, we have $11y = 11$.

  have : 11 * y = 11 := by linarith

  -- Thus, $y = 1$.

  have hy : y = 1 := by linarith

  -- From $3y = x$, we have $x = 3$.

  have hx : x = 3 := by linarith

  -- Therefore, the sum of the coordinates of point $A$ is $x + y = 3 + 1 = 4$.
