This solution first imports the necessary libraries and sets up the theorem statement. It then solves for the x-coordinate of the intersection point by substituting $x = 3y$ into $2x + 5y = 11$. After simplifying, it finds that $x = 3$. Using $x = 3y$, it then finds that $y = 1$. Therefore, the sum of the coordinates of point $A$ is $x + y = 3 + 1 = 4$.
</- In a rectangular coordinate system, the line $3y = x$ intersects the line $2x + 5y = 11$ at point $A$. What is the sum of the coordinates of point $A$? Show that it is 4.-/
