-- The point $A$ satisfies the equation $3y = x$ and $2x + 5y = 11$.

  -- From the first equation, we have $x = 3y$.

  -- Substituting $x = 3y$ into the second equation, we get $2(3y) + 5y = 11$.

  -- Simplifying, we have $6y + 5y = 11$, so $11y = 11$.

  -- Substituting $y = 1$ into $x = 3y$, we get $x = 3$.

  -- Therefore, the sum of the coordinates of point $A$ is $x + y = 3 + 1 = 4$.
