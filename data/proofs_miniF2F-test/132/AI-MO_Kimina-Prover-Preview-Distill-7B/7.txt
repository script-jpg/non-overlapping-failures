-- The point $A$ satisfies the equation $3y = x$ and $2x + 5y = 11$.

  -- We can substitute the first equation into the second.
  rw [h₀] at h₁

  -- Now, the equation becomes $2(3y) + 5y = 11$, or $6y + 5y = 11$.
  have h₂ : 6 * y + 5 * y = 11 := by linarith

  -- This simplifies to $11y = 11$.
  have h₃ : 11 * y = 11 := by linarith

  -- Dividing both sides by 11, we get $y = 1$.
  have h₄ : y = 1 := by linarith

  -- Substituting $y = 1$ into the equation $3y = x$, we get $3(1) = x$, or $x = 3$.
  rw [h₄] at h₀
  have h₅ : x = 3 := by linarith

  -- Therefore, the sum of the coordinates of point $A$ is $x + y = 3 + 1 = 4$.
