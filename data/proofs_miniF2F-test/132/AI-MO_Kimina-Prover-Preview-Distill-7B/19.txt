# Solving the Intersection of Two Lines in the Cartesian Plane

I'll solve the problem of finding the sum of coordinates of the intersection point of two lines defined by equations $3y = x$ and $2x + 5y = 11$.

First, let me think about how to approach this algebraically. We have a system of two equations:
1. $x = 3y$
2. $2x + 5y = 11$

We can substitute the first equation into the second to solve for $y$:

Substituting $x = 3y$ into $2x + 5y = 11$ gives: 
$2(3y) + 5y = 11$
$6y + 5y = 11$
$11y = 11$
$y = 1$

Now, substituting $y = 1$ back into $x = 3y$ gives:
$x = 3 \cdot 1 = 3$

Therefore, the coordinates of point $A$ are $(3, 1)$, and the sum of these coordinates is $3 + 1 = 4$.

Let's translate this to Lean 4:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

Now, I'll define the theorem statement with the given conditions:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_329 (x y : ℝ) (h₀ : 3 * y = x) (h₁ : 2 * x + 5 * y = 11) : x + y = 4 := by
```

We have our theorem statement with:
- Real numbers $x$ and $y$ representing the coordinates of point $A$
- Hypothesis h₀: $3y = x$ (from the first line equation)
- Hypothesis h₁: $2x + 5y = 11$ (from the second line equation)
- Goal: Prove that $x + y = 4$

Let's solve this system within Lean. First, I'll substitute the expression for $x$ from h₀ into h₁.

From h₀: $x = 3y$
Substituting into h₁: $2(3y) + 5y = 11$
Simplifying: $6y + 5y = 11$
So $11y = 11$
Therefore $y = 1$

In Lean, we can use the `linarith` tactic to solve linear arithmetic goals automatically. It can handle the substitution and solving process.

```tactics
have : 2 * (3 * y) + 5 * y = 11 := by rw [←h₀, h₁]
```

This establishes a new fact by substituting h₀ into h₁. Now we can solve for $y$:

```tactics
have hy : y = 1 := by linarith
```

Now that we have $y = 1$, we can substitute back into h₀ to find $x$:

From h₀: $x = 3y = 3 \cdot 1 = 3$

In Lean:

```tactics
have hx : x = 3 := by rw [hy] at h₀; linarith
```

Now we have $x = 3$ and $y = 1$. The sum of coordinates is $x + y = 3 + 1 = 4$.

To complete the proof:

```tactics
rw [hx, hy]
norm_num
```

These final tactics rewrite the goal using the established facts and then compute the numerical result, proving that $x + y = 4$.

Therefore, the sum of the coordinates of point $A$ is 4.
