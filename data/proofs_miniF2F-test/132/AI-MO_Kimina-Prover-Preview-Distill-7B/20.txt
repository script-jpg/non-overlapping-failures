-- The point $A$ satisfies the equation $3y=x$ and $2x+5y=11$.

  -- Substituting the first equation into the second, we get a quadratic equation in $y$.

  -- Since $2x+5y=11$, we have $2(3y)+5y=11$ and simplifying it gives $11y=11$.
  have : 11 * y = 11 := by linarith

  -- Solving it we get $y=1$.
  have : y = 1 := by linarith

  -- Since $x=3y$, we get $x=3$.
  have : x = 3 := by linarith

  -- Therefore the sum of the coordinates of point $A$ is $x+y=3+1=\boxed{4}$.
