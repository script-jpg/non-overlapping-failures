# Informal Proof:
We can use the `linarith` tactic to solve this system of linear equations. The tactic takes the two equations `h₀` and `h₁` as inputs and automatically determines that the sum of the coordinates $x + y$ equals 4.

We begin by importing the necessary libraries and setting up the basic framework for our proof.

Now, let's define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_329 (x y : ℝ) (h₀ : 3 * y = x) (h₁ : 2 * x + 5 * y = 11) : x + y = 4 := by
```

Our theorem states that if $x$ and $y$ are real numbers satisfying the equations $3y = x$ and $2x + 5y = 11$, then $x + y = 4$.

Let's think about how to approach this algebraically. We have:
1. $3y = x$
2. $2x + 5y = 11$

We can substitute the first equation into the second:
$2(3y) + 5y = 11$
$6y + 5y = 11$
$11y = 11$
$y = 1$

Now that we have $y = 1$, we can find $x$ using the first equation:
$x = 3y = 3(1) = 3$

So the sum of the coordinates is $x + y = 3 + 1 = 4$.

In Lean, we can use the `linarith` tactic to solve this system directly:

```tactics
linarith
```

The `linarith` tactic is powerful enough to solve systems of linear inequalities and equalities. It automatically:
1. Recognizes that $3y = x$ implies $x = 3y$
2. Substitutes this into $2x + 5y = 11$ to get $2(3y) + 5y = 11$
3. Simplifies to $11y = 11$
4. Solves to get $y = 1$
5. Substitutes $y = 1$ back into $x = 3y$ to get $x = 3$
6. Verifies that $x + y = 3 + 1 = 4$

Therefore, the complete proof is remarkably concise. The Lean 4 proof simply consists of the theorem statement followed by the `linarith` tactic, which automatically solves the system of equations and proves that $x + y = 4$.
