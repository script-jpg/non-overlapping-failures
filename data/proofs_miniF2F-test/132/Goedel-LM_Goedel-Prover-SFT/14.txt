  To solve the problem, we start by substituting \( x = 3y \) into the equation \( 2x + 5y = 11 \). This substitution simplifies the equation to \( 2(3y) + 5y = 11 \), which further simplifies to \( 6y + 5y = 11 \). Combining like terms, we get \( 11y = 11 \). Solving for \( y \), we find \( y = 1 \). Substituting \( y = 1 \) back into \( x = 3y \), we get \( x = 3 \). Therefore, the sum of the coordinates \( x + y \) is \( 3 + 1 = 4 \).
