  To solve the problem, we need to find the intersection point \( A \) of the lines \( 3y = x \) and \( 2x + 5y = 11 \). We then need to determine the sum of the coordinates of point \( A \).
  1. From the equation \( 3y = x \), we can express \( x \) in terms of \( y \):
     \[
     x = 3y
     \]
  2. Substitute \( x = 3y \) into the second equation \( 2x + 5y = 11 \):
     \[
     2(3y) + 5y = 11
     \]
  3. Simplify the equation:
     \[
     6y + 5y = 11
     \]
     \[
     11y = 11
     \]
  4. Solve for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 1
     \]
  5. Substitute \( y = 1 \) back into \( x = 3y \):
     \[
     x = 3(1) = 3
     \]
  6. Calculate the sum of the coordinates \( x + y \):
     \[
     x + y = 3 + 1 = 4
     \]
  Thus, the sum of the coordinates of point \( A \) is \( 4 \).

  -- From the equation 3y = x, express x in terms of y: x = 3y
  have h₀ : x = 3 * y := by linarith
  -- Substitute x = 3y into the second equation and solve for y
  have h₂ : y = 1 := by linarith
  -- Substitute y = 1 back into x = 3y to find x
  have h₃ : x = 3 := by linarith
  -- Calculate the sum of the coordinates x + y
