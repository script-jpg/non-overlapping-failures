  To solve the problem, we start by substituting the relationship \( y = \frac{x}{3} \) into the equation \( 2x + 5y = 11 \). This substitution simplifies the equation to a single variable, allowing us to solve for \( x \). Once \( x \) is determined, we can find \( y \) by using the relationship \( y = \frac{x}{3} \). Finally, we sum the coordinates \( x \) and \( y \) to verify that their sum is 4.
