  To solve the problem, we start by substituting \( x = 3y \) into the equation \( 2x + 5y = 11 \). This substitution simplifies the equation to a single variable, allowing us to solve for \( y \). Once \( y \) is determined, we substitute back to find \( x \). Finally, we sum the coordinates \( x \) and \( y \) to verify that their sum is 4.

  -- Substitute x = 3y into the equation 2x + 5y = 11.
  have h₂ := congr_arg (fun a => a + y) h₀
  -- This step is purely for simplification and does not change the equality.
  have h₃ := congr_arg (fun a => a + x) h₀
  -- Simplify the expressions using basic arithmetic operations.
  simp only [add_assoc, add_right_comm, add_left_comm, add_comm, add_left_comm, add_assoc] at h₂ h₃
  -- Use linear arithmetic to solve for x and y, and verify that x + y = 4.
