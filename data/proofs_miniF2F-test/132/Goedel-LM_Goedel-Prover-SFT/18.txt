  To solve the problem, we start by substituting the expression for \( x \) from the first equation into the second equation. This substitution simplifies the system of equations, allowing us to solve for \( y \). Once \( y \) is determined, we substitute it back into the expression for \( x \) to find \( x \). Finally, we sum the coordinates \( x \) and \( y \) to verify that their sum is 4.

  -- Substitute the expression for x from h₀ into h₁
  have h₁' := congr_arg (fun x => x + 5 * y) h₁
  -- Simplify the equation to isolate x + y
  simp only [mul_add, mul_one, mul_comm, mul_left_comm, mul_assoc] at h₁'
  -- Solve for x + y using linear arithmetic
