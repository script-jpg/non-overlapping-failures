  To solve the problem, we start by using the given equations:
  1. \( 3y = x \)
  2. \( 2x + 5y = 11 \)
  First, we substitute \( x = 3y \) into the second equation:
  \[ 2(3y) + 5y = 11 \]
  Simplifying this, we get:
  \[ 6y + 5y = 11 \]
  \[ 11y = 11 \]
  Solving for \( y \):
  \[ y = 1 \]
  Next, we substitute \( y = 1 \) back into the first equation to find \( x \):
  \[ x = 3(1) \]
  \[ x = 3 \]
  Finally, we calculate the sum of the coordinates \( x + y \):
  \[ x + y = 3 + 1 = 4 \]
  Thus, the sum of the coordinates of the intersection point \( A \) is 4.

  have h₁' : 2 * (3 * y) + 5 * y = 11 := by rw [h₀] at h₁; exact h₁
  -- Simplify the equation to solve for y.
  have h₂ : 11 * y = 11 := by linarith
  have h₃ : y = 1 := by linarith
  -- Substitute y = 1 back into the first equation to find x.
  have h₄ : x = 3 := by rw [h₃] at h₀; linarith
  -- Calculate the sum of the coordinates x + y.
  have h₅ : x + y = 4 := by linarith
  -- The final result is x + y = 4.
