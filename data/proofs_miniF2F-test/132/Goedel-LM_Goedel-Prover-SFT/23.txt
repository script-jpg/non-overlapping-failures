  To solve the problem, we start by using the given equations:
  1. \( 3y = x \)
  2. \( 2x + 5y = 11 \)
  First, we substitute \( x = 3y \) into the second equation:
  \[ 2(3y) + 5y = 11 \]
  \[ 6y + 5y = 11 \]
  \[ 11y = 11 \]
  \[ y = 1 \]
  Next, we substitute \( y = 1 \) back into the first equation to find \( x \):
  \[ x = 3(1) \]
  \[ x = 3 \]
  Finally, we calculate the sum of the coordinates of point \( A \):
  \[ x + y = 3 + 1 = 4 \]
  Thus, the sum of the coordinates of point \( A \) is indeed 4.
