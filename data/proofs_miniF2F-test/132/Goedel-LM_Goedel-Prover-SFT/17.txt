  To solve the problem, we start by substituting the expression for \( x \) from the first equation into the second equation. This substitution yields a single equation in terms of \( y \). Solving this equation for \( y \) gives the y-coordinate of point \( A \). Using the given equations, we substitute \( x = 3y \) into \( 2x + 5y = 11 \) to get \( 2(3y) + 5y = 11 \). Simplifying this, we find \( 6y + 5y = 11 \), which reduces to \( 11y = 11 \). Dividing both sides by 11, we get \( y = 1 \). Substituting \( y = 1 \) back into \( x = 3y \), we find \( x = 3 \). Therefore, the sum of the coordinates of point \( A \) is \( x + y = 3 + 1 = 4 \).
