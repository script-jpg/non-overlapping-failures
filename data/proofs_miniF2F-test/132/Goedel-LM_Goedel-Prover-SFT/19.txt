  Given the equations \(3y = x\) and \(2x + 5y = 11\), we need to find the sum of the coordinates of the intersection point \(A\) where these lines intersect. By substituting \(x = 3y\) into the second equation, we get \(2(3y) + 5y = 11\), which simplifies to \(11y = 11\). Solving for \(y\), we find \(y = 1\). Substituting \(y = 1\) back into \(x = 3y\), we get \(x = 3\). Therefore, the coordinates of point \(A\) are \((3, 1)\), and their sum is \(3 + 1 = 4\).
