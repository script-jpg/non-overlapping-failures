  To solve the problem, we need to find the intersection point of the lines \(3y = x\) and \(2x + 5y = 11\) and then determine the sum of its coordinates.
  1. Start by substituting \(x = 3y\) into the equation \(2x + 5y = 11\).
  2. Simplify the resulting equation to solve for \(y\).
  3. Once \(y\) is found, substitute it back to find \(x\).
  4. Finally, calculate the sum \(x + y\) and verify that it equals 4.

  -- Substitute x = 3y into the equation 2x + 5y = 11
  have h₁' : 2 * (3 * y) + 5 * y = 11 := by linarith
  -- Simplify the equation to solve for y
  have h₂ : 6 * y + 5 * y = 11 := by linarith
  have h₃ : 11 * y = 11 := by linarith
  -- Solve for y
  have h₄ : y = 1 := by linarith
  -- Substitute y = 1 back to find x
  have h₅ : x = 3 * 1 := by linarith
  have h₆ : x = 3 := by linarith
  -- Calculate the sum x + y
  have h₇ : x + y = 3 + 1 := by linarith
  have h₈ : x + y = 4 := by linarith
  -- Conclude the proof
  exact h₈
