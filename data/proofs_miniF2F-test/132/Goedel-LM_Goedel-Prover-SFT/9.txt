  To solve the problem, we start by substituting the expression for \( x \) from \( h_0 \) into \( h_1 \). This gives us an equation in terms of \( y \). Solving this equation for \( y \) yields the y-coordinate of the intersection point \( A \). Once \( y \) is determined, we substitute it back into the expression for \( x \) to find \( x \). Finally, we sum the coordinates \( x \) and \( y \) to verify that their sum is 4.

  -- Substitute the expression for x from h₀ into h₁.
  have h₂ : 2 * x + 5 * y = 11 := h₁
  have h₃ : 3 * y = x := h₀
  -- Solve the resulting equation for y.
  have h₄ : 2 * (3 * y) + 5 * y = 11 := by rw [h₃] at h₂; exact h₂
  have h₅ : 6 * y + 5 * y = 11 := by linarith
  have h₆ : 11 * y = 11 := by linarith
  have h₇ : y = 1 := by linarith
  -- Substitute y = 1 back into the expression for x.
  have h₈ : x = 3 * 1 := by rw [h₇] at h₃; exact h₃
  have h₉ : x = 3 := by linarith
  -- Sum the coordinates x and y to verify the sum is 4.
