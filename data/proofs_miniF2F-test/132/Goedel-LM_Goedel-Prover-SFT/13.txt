  To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:
  1. \( 3y = x \)
  2. \( 2x + 5y = 11 \)
  First, we substitute \( x = 3y \) into the second equation:
  \[ 2(3y) + 5y = 11 \]
  Simplify and solve for \( y \):
  \[ 6y + 5y = 11 \]
  \[ 11y = 11 \]
  \[ y = 1 \]
  Next, substitute \( y = 1 \) back into \( x = 3y \):
  \[ x = 3(1) \]
  \[ x = 3 \]
  Finally, calculate the sum of \( x \) and \( y \):
  \[ x + y = 3 + 1 = 4 \]

  -- Substitute x = 3y into the second equation
  have h₂ : 2 * (3 * y) + 5 * y = 11 := by rw [← h₀] at h₁; exact h₁
  -- Simplify the equation to solve for y
  have h₃ : 11 * y = 11 := by linarith
  -- Solve for y
  have h₄ : y = 1 := by linarith
  -- Substitute y = 1 back into x = 3y
  have h₅ : x = 3 := by rw [h₄] at h₀; linarith
  -- Calculate the sum of x and y
