  To solve the problem, we start by substituting the given relationship \(3y = x\) into the equation \(2x + 5y = 11\). This substitution simplifies the system of equations, allowing us to solve for \(y\) and then use the relationship \(3y = x\) to find \(x\). Finally, we sum the coordinates \(x\) and \(y\) to verify that their sum equals 4.

  -- Substitute the relationship 3y = x into the equation 2x + 5y = 11.
  have h₂ := congr_arg (fun x => x / 5) h₀
  have h₃ := congr_arg (fun x => x / 5) h₁
  -- Simplify the equations by dividing by 5.
  simp only [mul_div_cancel_left, mul_div_cancel_left] at h₂ h₃
  -- Solve for y using the simplified equation.
  have h₄ : y = 1 := by linarith
  -- Substitute y = 1 back into the relationship 3y = x to find x.
  have h₅ : x = 3 := by linarith
  -- Sum the coordinates x and y to verify the sum.
