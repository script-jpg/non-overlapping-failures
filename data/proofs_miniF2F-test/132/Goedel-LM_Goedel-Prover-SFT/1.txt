  To solve the problem, we start by using the given equations to find the coordinates of point \( A \). The first equation is \( 3y = x \), and the second equation is \( 2x + 5y = 11 \). We substitute \( x = 3y \) into the second equation to solve for \( y \).
  1. Substitute \( x = 3y \) into \( 2x + 5y = 11 \):
     \[
     2(3y) + 5y = 11
     \]
  2. Simplify the equation:
     \[
     6y + 5y = 11
     \]
     \[
     11y = 11
     \]
  3. Solve for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 1
     \]
  4. Substitute \( y = 1 \) back into \( x = 3y \):
     \[
     x = 3 \times 1 = 3
     \]
  5. Calculate the sum of the coordinates \( x + y \):
     \[
     x + y = 3 + 1 = 4
     \]
  Thus, the sum of the coordinates of point \( A \) is \( 4 \).
