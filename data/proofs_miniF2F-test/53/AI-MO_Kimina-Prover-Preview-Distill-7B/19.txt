-- We can apply the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (gcd).
  -- Let's compute the remainder of the division of $21n+4$ by $14n+3$.
  -- Notice that $21n+4 = (14n+3) \cdot 1 + (7n+1)$.
  have h₁ : 21 * n + 4 = (14 * n + 3) * 1 + (7 * n + 1) := by ring

  -- Now we compute the remainder of the division of $14n+3$ by $7n+1$.
  -- We have $14n+3 = (7n+1) \cdot 2 + 1$.
  have h₂ : 14 * n + 3 = (7 * n + 1) * 2 + 1 := by ring

  -- Finally, we compute the remainder of the division of $7n+1$ by $1$.
  -- We have $7n+1 = 1 \cdot (7n+1) + 0$.
  have h₃ : 7 * n + 1 = 1 * (7 * n + 1) + 0 := by ring

  -- Therefore, the gcd of $21n+4$ and $14n+3$ is the same as the gcd of $14n+3$ and $7n+1$.
  -- Which is the same as the gcd of $7n+1$ and $1$.
  -- Which is $1$.
