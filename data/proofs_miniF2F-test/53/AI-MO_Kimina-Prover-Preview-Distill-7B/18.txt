-- Using the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD)
  -- Start with GCD(21n+4, 14n+3)
  -- By Euclidean algorithm, GCD(a,b) = GCD(b, a mod b)
  -- 21n + 4 = 1 * (14n + 3) + (7n + 1)
  -- So GCD(21n+4, 14n+3) = GCD(14n+3, 7n+1)
  have h1 : (21 * n + 4).gcd (14 * n + 3) = (14 * n + 3).gcd (7 * n + 1) := by
    rw [show 21 * n + 4 = 1 * (14 * n + 3) + (7 * n + 1) by ring]
    exact Nat.gcd_add_mul_left (7 * n + 1) (14 * n + 3) 1

  -- Now GCD(14n+3, 7n+1)
  -- 14n + 3 = 2 * (7n + 1) + 1
  -- So GCD(14n+3, 7n+1) = GCD(7n+1, 1)
  have h2 : (14 * n + 3).gcd (7 * n + 1) = (7 * n + 1).gcd 1 := by
    rw [show 14 * n + 3 = 2 * (7 * n + 1) + 1 by ring]
    exact Nat.gcd_add_mul_left 1 (7 * n + 1) 2

  -- GCD(7n+1, 1) = 1 because any number GCD with 1 is 1
  have h3 : (7 * n + 1).gcd 1 = 1 := by
    exact Nat.gcd_one_right (7 * n + 1)
