-- We need to show that the greatest common divisor of (21n+4) and (14n+3) is 1 for any n > 0.

  -- Use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.

  -- Compute (21n+4) mod (14n+3):
  -- 21n + 4 = (14n + 3) * 1 + (7n + 1)
  have h1 : 21 * n + 4 = (14 * n + 3) * 1 + (7 * n + 1) := by ring

  -- So GCD(21n+4, 14n+3) = GCD(14n+3, 7n+1)

  -- Compute (14n+3) mod (7n+1):
  -- 14n + 3 = (7n + 1) * 2 + 1
  have h2 : 14 * n + 3 = (7 * n + 1) * 2 + 1 := by ring

  -- So GCD(14n+3, 7n+1) = GCD(7n+1, 1)

  -- Since 7n+1 and 1 are coprime, the GCD is 1.

  -- Therefore, the fraction (21n+4)/(14n+3) is irreducible for any n > 0.
