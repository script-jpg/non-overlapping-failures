-- We need to show that the greatest common divisor of (21n+4) and (14n+3) is 1.

  show Nat.gcd (21 * n + 4) (14 * n + 3) = 1

  -- Let's use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.

  -- Step 1: Apply the division algorithm to (21n+4) and (14n+3)
  -- We can write (21n+4) = (14n+3) * 1 + (7n+1)
  have step1 : 21 * n + 4 = (14 * n + 3) * 1 + (7 * n + 1) := by
    ring_nf

  -- Step 2: Apply the division algorithm to (14n+3) and (7n+1)
  -- We can write (14n+3) = (7n+1) * 2 + 1
  have step2 : 14 * n + 3 = (7 * n + 1) * 2 + 1 := by
    ring_nf

  -- Step 3: Apply the division algorithm to (7n+1) and 1
  -- We can write (7n+1) = 1 * (7n+1) + 0
  have step3 : 7 * n + 1 = 1 * (7 * n + 1) + 0 := by
    ring_nf

  -- According to the Euclidean algorithm, the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 1.
  -- So we need to use the lemmas:
  -- Nat.gcd a b = Nat.gcd b (a % b)
  -- Nat.gcd (a * b + c) b = Nat.gcd b c
