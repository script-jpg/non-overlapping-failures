  To prove that the fraction \(\frac{21n+4}{14n+3}\) is irreducible for every natural number \(n\), we need to show that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(21n + 4\) and \(14n + 3\) is 1. This can be achieved by demonstrating that the gcd of these two expressions is indeed 1. We will use the properties of the gcd and the fact that both expressions are linear combinations of \(n\) to simplify the problem.

  -- We will use induction on n to prove the statement.

  -- Base case: when n = 1, we need to show that gcd(21*1 + 4, 14*1 + 3) = 1.
  -- Simplifying, we get gcd(25, 17) = 1, which is true.

  -- Inductive step: assume the statement holds for n, i.e., gcd(21n + 4, 14n + 3) = 1.
  -- We need to show it holds for n + 1.
  -- Simplify the expressions for n + 1:
  -- 21(n + 1) + 4 = 21n + 21 + 4 = 21n + 25
  -- 14(n + 1) + 3 = 14n + 14 + 3 = 14n + 17
  -- By the inductive hypothesis, gcd(21n + 4, 14n + 3) = 1.
  -- We need to show that gcd(21n + 25, 14n + 17) = 1.
  -- Using the property of gcd, we know that gcd(a + b, c) = gcd(b + c, a) if a, b, c are integers.
  -- Here, we can apply this property to simplify the gcd calculation.
