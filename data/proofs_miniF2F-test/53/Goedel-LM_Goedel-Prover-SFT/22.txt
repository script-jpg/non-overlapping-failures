  To prove that the fraction \(\frac{21n+4}{14n+3}\) is irreducible for every natural number \(n\), we need to show that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(21n + 4\) and \(14n + 3\) is 1. This can be achieved by demonstrating that the gcd of these two numbers is always 1. We use the property that the gcd of two numbers remains the same if we subtract one number from the other repeatedly. Specifically, we show that the gcd of \(21n + 4\) and \(14n + 3\) is the same as the gcd of \(7n + 1\) and \(7n + 3\), which simplifies to 1.
