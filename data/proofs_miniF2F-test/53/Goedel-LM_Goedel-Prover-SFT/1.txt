  To prove that the fraction \(\frac{21n+4}{14n+3}\) is irreducible for every natural number \(n\), we need to show that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(21n + 4\) and \(14n + 3\) is 1 for all \(n\). We will use the property that the gcd of two numbers is 1 if and only if there exist integers \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(21n + 4 = x(14n + 3) + y\).
  1. Start by expressing the gcd in terms of the given numbers.
  2. Use the property that \(\gcd(a, b) = 1\) if and only if there exist integers \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(a = xb + y\).
  3. Substitute \(a = 21n + 4\) and \(b = 14n + 3\) into the equation.
  4. Solve for \(x\) and \(y\) using the equation \(21n + 4 = x(14n + 3) + y\).
  5. Verify that the only solution is \(x = 1\) and \(y = -3\), which confirms that the gcd is 1.
