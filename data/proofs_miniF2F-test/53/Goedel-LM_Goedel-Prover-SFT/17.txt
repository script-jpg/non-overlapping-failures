  To prove that the fraction \(\frac{21n + 4}{14n + 3}\) is irreducible for every natural number \(n\), we need to show that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(21n + 4\) and \(14n + 3\) is 1. This can be achieved by demonstrating that the gcd of these two expressions is always 1. We will use the properties of the gcd and some arithmetic manipulations to establish this.
