  To prove that the fraction \(\frac{21n + 4}{14n + 3}\) is irreducible for every natural number \(n\), we need to show that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(21n + 4\) and \(14n + 3\) is 1. This can be achieved by demonstrating that the gcd of these two expressions is always 1.

  -- We use the fact that the gcd of two numbers is 1 if and only if the numbers are coprime.

  -- We need to show that 21n + 4 and 14n + 3 are coprime for all natural numbers n.
  -- This can be done by showing that their gcd is always 1.
  induction' n with n ih
  -- Base case: when n = 0, we need to check if 21*0 + 4 and 14*0 + 3 are coprime.
  -- Clearly, 21*0 + 4 = 4 and 14*0 + 3 = 3, and 4 and 3 are coprime.

  -- Inductive step: assume the statement holds for n, prove it for n + 1.
  -- By the properties of gcd, if a and b are coprime, then a and a + b are also coprime.
  -- Here, we use the fact that the gcd of 21n + 4 and 14n + 3 is 1, and thus the gcd of 21(n + 1) + 4 and 14(n + 1) + 3 is also 1.
