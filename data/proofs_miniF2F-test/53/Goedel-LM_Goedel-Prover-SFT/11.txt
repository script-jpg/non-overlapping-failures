  To prove that the fraction \(\frac{21n+4}{14n+3}\) is irreducible for every natural number \(n\), we need to show that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(21n + 4\) and \(14n + 3\) is 1 for all \(n\). This can be achieved by demonstrating that the gcd of these two expressions is always 1.

  -- Base case: when n = 1, check that the gcd of 21 * 1 + 4 and 14 * 1 + 3 is 1.

  -- Inductive step: assume the statement holds for n, prove it for n + 1.
  -- Use the fact that the gcd of 21 * (n + 1) + 4 and 14 * (n + 1) + 3 can be expressed in terms of the gcd of 21n + 4 and 14n + 3.
