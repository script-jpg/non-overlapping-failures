  To prove that the fraction \(\frac{21n+4}{14n+3}\) is irreducible for every natural number \(n\), we need to show that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(21n + 4\) and \(14n + 3\) is 1 for all \(n\). This can be achieved by demonstrating that the gcd of these two expressions is always 1.

  -- Use the property that if the gcd of two numbers is 1, then they are coprime.
  apply Nat.eq_of_mul_eq_mul_right (show 0 < 2 by norm_num)
  -- Rewrite the equation to show that the gcd of (21n + 4) and (14n + 3) is 1.
