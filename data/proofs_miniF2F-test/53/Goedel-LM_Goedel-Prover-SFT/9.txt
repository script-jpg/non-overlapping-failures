  To prove that the fraction \(\frac{21n+4}{14n+3}\) is irreducible for every natural number \(n\), we need to show that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(21n + 4\) and \(14n + 3\) is 1. This can be achieved by demonstrating that the gcd of these two numbers is always 1.

  -- We need to show that the gcd of (21 * n + 4) and (14 * n + 3) is 1.
  -- This can be done by proving that the gcd is always 1.
  apply Eq.symm
  -- Use the symmetry of equality to show that 1 is equal to the gcd.
  rw [Nat.gcd_comm]
  -- Rewrite the gcd using the commutative property, which states that gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a).
  simp [Nat.gcd_eq_right]
  -- Simplify the expression using the fact that the gcd of two numbers is always 1.
  -- Specifically, we use the property that gcd(a, b) = 1 if and only if a and b are coprime.
  -- Here, we use the fact that 21n + 4 and 14n + 3 are coprime for all natural numbers n.
