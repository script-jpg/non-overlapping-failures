  To prove that the fraction \(\frac{21n+4}{14n+3}\) is irreducible for every natural number \(n\), we need to show that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(21n + 4\) and \(14n + 3\) is 1. We will use the property that the gcd of two numbers remains 1 if we subtract one number from the other repeatedly.
  1. Start by expressing the gcd in a form that allows us to use the properties of gcd.
  2. Apply the Euclidean algorithm, which states that \(\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(b, a \mod b)\).
  3. Simplify the expressions using numerical normalization and properties of gcd.
  4. Use induction to show that the gcd remains 1 for all natural numbers \(n\).
