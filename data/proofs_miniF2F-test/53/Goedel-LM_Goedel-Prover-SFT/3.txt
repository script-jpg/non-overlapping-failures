  To prove that the fraction \(\frac{21n + 4}{14n + 3}\) is irreducible for every natural number \(n\), we need to show that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(21n + 4\) and \(14n + 3\) is 1. This can be achieved by demonstrating that the gcd of these two expressions is 1 for any natural number \(n\).

  -- Use the property of gcd that if a number divides both expressions, it must divide their gcd.

  -- Simplify the gcd expression using the fact that the gcd of two numbers is 1 if they are coprime.

    Nat.gcd_eq_left, Nat.gcd_eq_right, Nat.gcd_eq_left]
  -- Use the `omega` tactic to solve the resulting linear arithmetic problem, confirming that the gcd is 1.
