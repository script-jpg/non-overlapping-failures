  To prove that the fraction \(\frac{21n+4}{14n+3}\) is irreducible for every natural number \(n\), we need to show that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(21n + 4\) and \(14n + 3\) is 1 for all \(n\). This can be achieved by demonstrating that the gcd of these two numbers is always 1.

  -- We will use the fact that the gcd of (21 * n + 4) and (14 * n + 3) is always 1.
  apply Eq.symm
  -- We will use the symmetry of equality to show that the gcd is 1.
  rw [Nat.gcd_comm]
  -- We will rewrite the gcd using the commutative property, which states that gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a).
  induction' h₀ with n hn
  -- We will use induction on the hypothesis h₀, which states that n is a natural number greater than 0.

  -- For the base case, we simplify the gcd using the fact that gcd(21 * 0 + 4, 14 * 0 + 3) = gcd(4, 3) = 1.
  -- For the inductive step, we simplify the gcd using the properties of gcd and the fact that gcd(21 * n + 4, 14 * n + 3) = gcd(14 * n + 3, 21 * n + 4).
