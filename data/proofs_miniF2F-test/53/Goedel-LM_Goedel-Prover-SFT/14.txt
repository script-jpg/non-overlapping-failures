  To prove that the fraction \(\frac{21n+4}{14n+3}\) is irreducible for every natural number \(n\), we need to show that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(21n + 4\) and \(14n + 3\) is 1. This can be achieved by demonstrating that the gcd of these two numbers is always 1 for any natural number \(n\).

  -- Use the property that the gcd of two numbers is 1 if and only if there exist integers a and b such that a(21n + 4) + b(14n + 3) = 1.

  -- Simplify the expression using the fact that the gcd of two numbers is 1 if and only if the gcd of the smaller number and the remainder of the larger number divided by the smaller number is 1.

  -- Use the omega tactic to solve the resulting linear Diophantine equation.
