  To prove that the fraction \(\frac{21n+4}{14n+3}\) is irreducible for every natural number \(n\), we need to show that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(21n + 4\) and \(14n + 3\) is 1 for all \(n\). This can be achieved by demonstrating that the gcd of these two expressions is always 1.

  -- We need to show that the gcd of (21 * n + 4) and (14 * n + 3) is 1 for all n.
  have h₁ : Nat.gcd (21 * n + 4) (14 * n + 3) = 1 := by
    -- Use the fact that the gcd of two numbers is 1 if and only if they are coprime.

  -- Since h₁ is true, we can conclude that the gcd is 1 for all n.
