  To prove that the fraction \(\frac{21n + 4}{14n + 3}\) is irreducible for every natural number \(n\), we need to show that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(21n + 4\) and \(14n + 3\) is 1. This can be achieved by demonstrating that the gcd of these two expressions is 1 for any natural number \(n\).
