  To prove that the fraction \(\frac{21n+4}{14n+3}\) is irreducible for every natural number \(n\), we need to show that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(21n + 4\) and \(14n + 3\) is 1. We will use the properties of gcd and the fact that both numbers are positive to demonstrate this.
  1. We start by applying the property that if \(a\) and \(b\) are positive, then \(\gcd(a, b) = 1\) if and only if \(\gcd(a, b - a) = 1\).
  2. We choose \(a = 21n + 4\) and \(b = 14n + 3\).
  3. We simplify the expression \(\gcd(21n + 4, 14n + 3)\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
  4. By induction on \(n\), we show that the gcd remains 1 for all natural numbers \(n\).
