  To prove that the fraction \(\frac{21n+4}{14n+3}\) is irreducible for every natural number \(n\), we need to show that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(21n + 4\) and \(14n + 3\) is 1. We will use the properties of gcd and the fact that 7 is a common factor to demonstrate this.
  1. **Common Factor**: We observe that both \(21n + 4\) and \(14n + 3\) are divisible by 7.
  2. **Simplification**: By dividing both expressions by 7, we get \(3n + 4\) and \(2n + 3\).
  3. **GCD Calculation**: We calculate the gcd of \(3n + 4\) and \(2n + 3\).
  4. **Verification**: We verify that the gcd is indeed 1 by checking that the expressions are not divisible by any number greater than 1.
