  To prove that the fraction \(\frac{21n+4}{14n+3}\) is irreducible for every natural number \(n\), we need to show that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(21n + 4\) and \(14n + 3\) is 1. This can be achieved by demonstrating that the gcd of these two expressions is equal to 1. We will use the properties of gcd and the Euclidean algorithm to simplify the expressions.

  -- We will use the property that if the gcd of two numbers is 1, then the gcd of their linear combinations is also 1.

  -- Use the `omega` tactic to solve the resulting linear arithmetic problem.
