/- We use the Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that if $p$ is a prime and $a$ is an integer not divisible by $p$,
     then $a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$. Here, $p = 7$ and $a = 5$. -/
  have fin : 5 ^ 6 % 7 = 1 := by rfl

  /- To compute $5^{999,999} \bmod 7$, we first find $999,999 \bmod 6$ to reduce the exponent. -/
  have rem : 999999 % 6 = 3 := by norm_num

  /- Using the property that $a^{\bmod} b \equiv (a \bmod b)^{\bmod} b \pmod{b}$, we calculate the remainder -/
  have hered : 5 ^ 999999 % 7 = 5 ^ (999999 % 6) % 7 := by
    rw [Nat.pow_mod]
  rw [hered, rem]

  /- Now we need to compute $5^3 \bmod 7 = 125 \bmod 7 = 6 -/
  have h : 5 ^ 3 % 7 = 6 := by norm_num

  /- Using the property that $a^{\bmod} b \equiv (a \bmod b)^{\bmod} b \pmod{b}$, we calculate the remainder -/
  have hmod : (5 ^ 3 % 7) % 7 = 6 % 7 := by
