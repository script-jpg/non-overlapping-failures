-- To solve this problem, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that if \( p \) is a prime and \( a \) is an integer not divisible by \( p \), then \( a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \mod p \). Here, \( p = 7 \) and \( a = 5 \).

  have h1: Nat.Prime 7 := by norm_num

  have h2: 5 > 0 := by norm_num

  have h3: 5 < 7 := by norm_num

  have h4 := Nat.modEq_iff_dvd.mpr

  have h5 := (Nat.modEq_iff_dvd.mp (Nat.mod_eq_of_lt h3)).mpr

  have h6: 5 ^ 6 % 7 = 1 := by norm_num

  have h7: 999999 = 6 * 166666 + 3 := by norm_num

  have h8: 5 ^ 999999 % 7 = (5 ^ (6 * 166666 + 3)) % 7 := by rw [h7]

  have h9: 5 ^ (6 * 166666 + 3) = (5 ^ 6) ^ 166666 * 5 ^ 3 := by rw [Nat.pow_add, Nat.pow_mul]

  rw [h8, h9]

  have h10: ((5 ^ 6) ^ 166666 * 5 ^ 3) % 7 = ((5 ^ 6) % 7) ^ 166666 * (5 ^ 3 % 7) := by

    rw [Nat.mul_mod]

  rw [h10]

  have h11: (5 ^ 6 % 7) ^ 166666 = 1 ^ 166666 := by rw [h6]

  have h12: 1 ^ 166666 = 1 := by rw [Nat.one_pow]

  have h13: (5 ^ 3 % 7) = 6 := by norm_num

  rw [h11, h12, h13, Nat.one_mul]
