-- To solve this, we'll use Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that if \(p\) is a prime and \(a\) is not divisible by \(p\), then \(a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}\).
  have : Fact (Nat.Prime 7) := ⟨by decide⟩
  have : Fact (Nat.Prime 6) := ⟨by decide⟩
  have : Fact (7 ≠ 0) := ⟨by decide⟩
  have : Fact (6 ≠ 0) := ⟨by decide⟩

  -- We calculate \(5^3 \mod 7 = 6\).
  have test : 5 ^ 3 % 7 = 6 := by decide

  -- We calculate \(5^6 \mod 7 = 1\).
  have test2 : 5 ^ 6 % 7 = 1 := by decide

  -- Now, we need to find the remainder when 999,999 is divided by 6.
  have remainder : 999999 % 6 = 3 := by decide

  -- Using these facts, we can determine \(5^{999,999} \mod 7\).
