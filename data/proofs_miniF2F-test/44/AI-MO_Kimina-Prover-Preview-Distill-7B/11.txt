-- To solve this problem, we can make use of Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that if \(p\) is a prime and \(a\) is an integer not divisible by \(p\), then \(a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \mod p\). In our case, \(p = 7\) and \(a = 5\). According to Fermat's Little Theorem, \(5^{6} \equiv 1 \mod 7\).
  have fin : 5 ^ 6 % 7 = 1 := by decide

  -- Now, to compute \(5^{999,999} \mod 7\), we can express 999,999 in terms of multiples of 6 plus a remainder. Specifically, we can divide 999,999 by 6 to find the quotient and remainder. 
  have h : 999999 = 6 * 166666 + 3 := by norm_num

  -- Therefore, \(5^{999,999} = 5^{6 \cdot 166,666 + 3} = (5^6)^{166,666} \cdot 5^3\).

  -- We know from Fermat's Little Theorem that \(5^6 \equiv 1 \mod 7\), so \((5^6)^{166,666} \equiv 1^{166,666} \equiv 1 \mod 7\).
  have finv : 1 ^ 166666 % 7 = 1 := by decide

  -- Now we need to compute \(5^3 \mod 7\), where \(5^3 = 125\).
  have fin2 : 125 % 7 = 6 := by norm_num

  -- Combining these results, we have:
  -- \[
  -- 5^{999,999} \equiv (5^6)^{166,666} \cdot 5^3 \equiv 1^{166,666} \cdot 125 \equiv 1 \cdot 125 \equiv 125 \equiv 6 \mod 7
