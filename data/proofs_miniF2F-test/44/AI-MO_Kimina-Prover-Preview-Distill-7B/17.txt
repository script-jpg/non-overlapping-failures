/- We use the Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that if $p$ is a prime and $a$ is an integer not divisible by $p$,
     then $a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$. Here, $p = 7$ and $a = 5$. -/

  /- We decompose the exponent 999,999 into a multiple of 6 plus a remainder. -/
  have deca : 999999 = 6 * 166666 + 3 := by norm_num
  /- We substitute this decomposition into the original expression. -/
