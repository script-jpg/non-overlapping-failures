-- To solve this problem, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that if \( p \) is a prime number and \( a \) is an integer not divisible by \( p \), then \( a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \mod p \). In this case, \( p = 7 \) and \( a = 5 \). According to Fermat's Little Theorem, \( 5^{6} \equiv 1 \mod 7 \).

  have : 5 ^ 6 % 7 = 1 := by rfl

  -- This means that every time the exponent is a multiple of 6, the remainder will be 1. Now, we need to determine how many complete cycles of 6 are in 999,999 and what the remainder is.

  have : 999999 = 6 * 166666 + 3 := by norm_num

  -- We can express 999,999 as \( 6 \times 166666 + 3 \). This means that \( 5^{999,999} \) can be rewritten as \( (5^{6})^{166666} \times 5^{3} \).

  rw [this, pow_add, pow_mul]

  -- We know that \( (5^{6})^{166666} \equiv 1^{166666} \equiv 1 \mod 7 \) based on Fermat's Little Theorem. So we only need to calculate \( 5^{3} \mod 7 \).

  have : 5 ^ 3 % 7 = 6 := by rfl

  -- Since the remainder of 999,999 when divided by 6 is 3, and \( 5^{3} \equiv 6 \mod 7 \), the remainder of \( 5^{999,999} \) divided by 7 is 6.
