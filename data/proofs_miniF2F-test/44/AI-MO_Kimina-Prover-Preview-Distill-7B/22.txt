-- Note that 5 ^ 6 = 1 mod 7 by Fermat's Little Theorem.
  have h : 5 ^ 6 ≡ 1 [MOD 7] := by rfl

  -- Since 999,999 = 6 * 166,666 + 3, we can write 5 ^ 999,999 as (5 ^ 6) ^ 166,666 * 5 ^ 3.
  have h1 : 999999 = 6 * 166666 + 3 := by norm_num

  -- So, 5 ^ 999,999 = (5 ^ 6) ^ 166,666 * 5 ^ 3 mod 7
  rw [h1, pow_add, pow_mul]

  -- Now, we need to compute 5 ^ 3 mod 7, which is 6.
  exact Nat.ModEq.mul (Nat.ModEq.pow 166666 h) (by rfl)
