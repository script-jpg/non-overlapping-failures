-- To solve this problem, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that if \( p \) is a prime number and \( a \) is an integer not divisible by \( p \), then \( a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \mod p \). In this case, \( p = 7 \) and \( a = 5 \).

  have h1 : 5 ^ 6 % 7 = 1 := by norm_num

  -- The theorem tells us that \( 5^6 \equiv 1 \mod 7 \). Now, we can express 999,999 in terms of multiples of 6 to simplify the expression.

  have h2 : 999999 = 6 * 166666 + 3 := by norm_num

  -- Using the property of exponents, we can rewrite \( 5^{999,999} \) as \( (5^6)^{166,666} \cdot 5^3 \).

  rw [h2, pow_add, pow_mul]

  -- Since we know \( 5^6 \equiv 1 \mod 7 \), we can substitute this into our expression. 
  -- This reduces the problem to finding \( 5^3 \mod 7 \).

  rw [Nat.pow_mod, h1]

  -- Now we just need to calculate \( 5^3 \mod 7 \).
