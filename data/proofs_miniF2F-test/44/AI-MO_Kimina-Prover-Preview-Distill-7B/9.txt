/-- We begin by stating Fermat's Little Theorem, which tells us that if $p$ is a prime number and $a$ is an integer not divisible by $p$, then $a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$. In our case, $p = 7$ and $a = 5$. -/
  have fin : 5 ^ 6 % 7 = 1 := by norm_num

  /-- Now, we need to express 999,999 in terms of multiples of 6, the exponent in Fermat's Little Theorem, to separate out the full cycles of 6. We do this by dividing 999,999 by 6 and finding the remainder, which will tell us how many full cycles of 6 there are and what the remainder is. -/
  have fin₀ : 999999 = 6 * 166666 + 3 := by norm_num

  /-- We substitute this into our expression, first rewriting the full expression by separating the remainder, and then rewriting the power with the remainder. This gives us $5^{999,999} = (5^{6})^{166,666} \cdot 5^{3}$. -/
  rw [show 999999 = 6 * 166666 + 3 by norm_num, pow_add, pow_mul]

  /-- Now, we can substitute Fermat's Little Theorem, which we have already established as `fin`, to simplify $(5^6)^{166,666}$. This simplifies to $1^{166,666} = 1$. -/
  rw [← fin]

  /-- Finally, we calculate the remainder of $1 \cdot 5^3 = 5^3 = 125$. This is $125 \mod 7 = 6$. -/
