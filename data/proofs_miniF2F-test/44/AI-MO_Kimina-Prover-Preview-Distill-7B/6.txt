-- To solve this problem, we can make use of Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that if \(p\) is a prime number and \(a\) is an integer not divisible by \(p\), then \(a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \mod p\). In our case, \(p = 7\) and \(a = 5\). According to Fermat's Little Theorem, \(5^{6} \equiv 1 \mod 7\).

  have fin : 5 ^ 6 % 7 = 1 := by
    norm_num

  -- Now, to find \(5^{999,999} \mod 7\), we can express 999,999 in terms of multiples of 6 plus a remainder. Dividing 999,999 by 6 gives a quotient of 166,666 and a remainder of 3. Thus, \(999,999 = 6 \cdot 166,666 + 3\).

  have finv : 999999 = 6 * 166666 + 3 := by
    norm_num

  -- Therefore, \(5^{999,999} = 5^{6 \cdot 166,666 + 3} = (5^{6})^{166,666} \cdot 5^{3}\).

  have finv2 : 5 ^ 999999 = (5 ^ 6) ^ 166666 * 5 ^ 3 := by
    rw [finv, pow_add, pow_mul]

  -- Using Fermat's Little Theorem, we know that \(5^{6} \equiv 1 \mod 7\), so \((5^{6})^{166,666} \equiv 1^{166,666} \equiv 1 \mod 7\). Thus, \(5^{999,999} \equiv 5^{3} \mod 7\).

  have finv3 : (5 ^ 6) ^ 166666 * 5 ^ 3 % 7 = 5 ^ 3 % 7 := by
    rw [Nat.mul_mod]
    rw [pow_mod]
    simp [fin]

  -- Finally, we calculate \(5^{3} \mod 7\). Since \(5^{3} = 125\) and \(125 \div 7\) gives a quotient of 17 and a remainder of 6, we have \(5^{3} \equiv 6 \mod 7\).

  have finv4 : 5 ^ 3 % 7 = 6 := by
    norm_num

  -- Combining these results, we conclude that \(5^{999,999} \equiv 6 \mod 7\). Therefore, the remainder when 5 to the 999,999th power is divided by 7 is 6.
