-- We try using Fermat's little theorem, which states that if p is a prime and a is an integer not divisible by p,
  -- then a^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p). Here, p = 7 and a = 5.
  have h : 5 ^ 6 ≡ 1 [MOD 7] := by rfl

  -- Next, we want to decompose 999,999 into a multiple of 6 plus a remainder.
  have h999999 : 999999 = 6 * 166666 + 3 := by norm_num

  -- Using the properties of modular exponentiation, we can separate the expression into a product of
  -- 5^6^166666 and 5^3.
  rw [h999999, pow_add, pow_mul]

  -- Since 5^6^166666 ≡ 1^166666 ≡ 1 (mod 7), we are left to calculate 5^3 mod 7.
  suffices 5 ^ 3 % 7 = 6 by rw [Nat.mod_eq_of_lt]; positivity; rw [Nat.pow_mod]; exact this

  -- For that, we can simply calculate 5^3 = 125 and 125 mod 7 = 6.
