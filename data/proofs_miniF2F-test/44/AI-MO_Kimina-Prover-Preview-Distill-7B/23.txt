-- To solve this problem, we will use Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that if \( p \) is a prime number and \( a \) is an integer not divisible by \( p \), then \( a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \mod p \). In our case, \( p = 7 \) and \( a = 5 \).

  have h1 : 5 ^ 6 % 7 = 1 := by norm_num

  -- Fermat's Little Theorem tells us that \( 5^6 \equiv 1 \mod 7 \). This means that every 6 powers, the remainder repeats. Thus, to find \( 5^{999,999} \mod 7 \), we need to determine \( 999,999 \mod 6 \).

  have h2 : 999999 % 6 = 3 := by norm_num

  -- know that \( 999,999 \equiv 3 \mod 6 \), we can write \( 999,999 = 6k + 3 \) for some integer \( k \). Then, \( 5^{999,999} = 5^{6k + 3} = (5^6)^k \cdot 5^3 \).

  -- Since \( 5^6 \equiv 1 \mod 7 \), \( (5^6)^k \equiv 1^k \equiv 1 \mod 7 \). Therefore, \( 5^{999,999} \equiv 5^3 \mod 7 \).

  have h3 : 5 ^ 3 % 7 = 6 := by norm_num

  -- The remainder of \( 5^3 \) when divided by 7 is 6. Therefore, the remainder of \( 5^{999,999} \) when divided by 7 is also 6.
