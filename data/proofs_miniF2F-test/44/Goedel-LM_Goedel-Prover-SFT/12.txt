  To determine the remainder when \(5^{999,999}\) is divided by 7, we can use properties of modular arithmetic. First, we note that \(5 \equiv 5 \pmod{7}\). We need to find \(5^{999,999} \mod 7\). Notice that \(5^3 = 125 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}\). Therefore, we can express \(5^{999,999}\) as \((5^3)^{333} \cdot 5^0 \equiv 6^{333} \cdot 1 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}\). Thus, the remainder when \(5^{999,999}\) is divided by 7 is 6.

  simp [Nat.pow_mod, show 5 % 7 = 5 by rfl, show 6 % 7 = 6 by rfl]
  -- Since 5^3 ≡ 6 (mod 7), we can simplify 5^999,999 to 6^333.
  -- The remainder of 6^333 when divided by 7 is 6.
