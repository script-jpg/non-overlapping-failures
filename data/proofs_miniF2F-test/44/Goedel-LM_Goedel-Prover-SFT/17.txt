  To determine the remainder when \(5^{999999}\) is divided by 7, we can use modular arithmetic properties. First, observe that \(5 \equiv -2 \pmod{7}\). Therefore, we can rewrite the problem as finding the remainder of \((-2)^{999999}\) when divided by 7. Using properties of powers and modular arithmetic, we can simplify the expression. Specifically, we can use the fact that \((-2)^6 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}\) and \((-2)^999999 = (-2)^{999999 \mod 6}\). Since \(999999 \equiv 3 \pmod{6}\), we have \((-2)^{999999} \equiv (-2)^3 \pmod{7}\). Finally, compute \((-2)^3 = -8 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}\).
