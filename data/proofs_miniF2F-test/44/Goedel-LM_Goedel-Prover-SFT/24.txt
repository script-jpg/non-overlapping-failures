  To determine the remainder when \(5^{999,999}\) is divided by 7, we can use properties of modular arithmetic. Specifically, we will compute the powers of 5 modulo 7 and observe the periodicity.
  1. Compute \(5^1 \mod 7\):
     \[
     5^1 \equiv 5 \mod 7
     \]
  2. Compute \(5^2 \mod 7\):
     \[
     5^2 = 25 \equiv 4 \mod 7
     \]
  3. Compute \(5^3 \mod 7\):
     \[
     5^3 = 5 \cdot 25 \equiv 5 \cdot 4 = 20 \equiv 6 \mod 7
     \]
  4. Compute \(5^4 \mod 7\):
     \[
     5^4 = 5 \cdot 20 \equiv 5 \cdot 6 = 30 \equiv 2 \mod 7
     \]
  5. Compute \(5^5 \mod 7\):
     \[
     5^5 = 5 \cdot 30 \equiv 5 \cdot 2 = 10 \equiv 3 \mod 7
     \]
  6. Compute \(5^6 \mod 7\):
     \[
     5^6 = 5 \cdot 10 \equiv 5 \cdot 3 = 15 \equiv 1 \mod 7
     \]
  We observe that \(5^6 \equiv 1 \mod 7\). This indicates a periodicity of 6, meaning \(5^{6k} \equiv 1 \mod 7\) for any integer \(k\). Therefore, we can reduce the exponent modulo 6:
  \[
  999,999 \mod 6 = 3
  \]
  Thus, \(5^{999,999} \equiv 5^3 \mod 7\), and we already computed \(5^3 \equiv 6 \mod 7\). Hence, the remainder when \(5^{999,999}\) is divided by 7 is 6.

  -- The above line simplifies the expression using modular arithmetic properties.
  -- Specifically, it computes the powers of 5 modulo 7 and observes the periodicity.
  -- Since 5^6 ≡ 1 (mod 7), we can reduce the exponent modulo 6.
  -- 999999 % 6 = 3, so 5^999999 ≡ 5^3 (mod 7).
  -- We already computed 5^3 ≡ 6 (mod 7), hence the result is 6.
