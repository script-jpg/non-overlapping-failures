  To determine the remainder when \(5^{999999}\) is divided by 7, we can use properties of modular arithmetic. First, observe that the powers of 5 modulo 7 cycle every 3 steps:
  \[
  \begin{aligned}
  5^1 &\equiv 5 \mod 7, \\
  5^2 &\equiv 25 \equiv 4 \mod 7, \\
  5^3 &\equiv 125 \equiv 6 \mod 7.
  \end{aligned}
  \]
  Since \(5^3 \equiv 6 \mod 7\), we can express \(5^{999999}\) in terms of \(5^3\):
  \[
  5^{999999} = (5^3)^{333333} \cdot 5^0 \equiv 6^{333333} \cdot 1 \equiv 6 \mod 7.
  \]
  Thus, the remainder when \(5^{999999}\) is divided by 7 is 6.
