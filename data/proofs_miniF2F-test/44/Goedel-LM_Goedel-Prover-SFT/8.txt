  To determine the remainder when \(5^{999,999}\) is divided by 7, we can use properties of modular arithmetic. First, we observe that \(5 \equiv -2 \pmod{7}\). Therefore, we can rewrite the problem as finding the remainder of \((-2)^{999,999}\) when divided by 7.
  Since 999,999 is an odd number, \((-2)^{999,999} \equiv -2^{999,999} \pmod{7}\). We need to compute \(2^{999,999} \mod 7\).
  Using Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that for any integer \(a\) and a prime \(p\), \(a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}\), we have:
  \[ 2^6 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
  Thus, \(2^{999,999} = 2^{6 \cdot 166666 + 3} \equiv (2^6)^{166666} \cdot 2^3 \equiv 1^{166666} \cdot 8 \equiv 8 \pmod{7} \equiv 1 \pmod{7}\).
  Since \((-2)^{999,999} \equiv -1 \pmod{7}\), we have:
  \[ -2^{999,999} \equiv -1 \pmod{7} \]
  Therefore, the remainder when \(5^{999,999}\) is divided by 7 is 6.
