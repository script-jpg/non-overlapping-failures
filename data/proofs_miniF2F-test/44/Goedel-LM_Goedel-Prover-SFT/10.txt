  To determine the remainder when \(5^{999,999}\) is divided by 7, we can use modular arithmetic properties. First, we find the pattern in the powers of 5 modulo 7. We observe that:
  \[
  \begin{aligned}
  5^1 &\equiv 5 \mod 7, \\
  5^2 &\equiv 25 \equiv 4 \mod 7, \\
  5^3 &\equiv 5 \cdot 4 \equiv 20 \equiv 6 \mod 7, \\
  5^4 &\equiv 5 \cdot 6 \equiv 30 \equiv 2 \mod 7, \\
  5^5 &\equiv 5 \cdot 2 \equiv 10 \equiv 3 \mod 7, \\
  5^6 &\equiv 5 \cdot 3 \equiv 15 \equiv 1 \mod 7.
  \end{aligned}
  \]
  From this, we see that \(5^6 \equiv 1 \mod 7\). This periodicity allows us to simplify \(5^{999,999}\) modulo 7. We can write 999,999 as \(6 \times 166,666 + 3\). Thus,
  \[
  5^{999,999} = 5^{6 \times 166,666 + 3} = (5^6)^{166,666} \times 5^3 \equiv 1^{166,666} \times 5^3 \equiv 5^3 \mod 7.
  \]
  From our earlier calculations, \(5^3 \equiv 6 \mod 7\). Therefore, the remainder when \(5^{999,999}\) is divided by 7 is 6.
