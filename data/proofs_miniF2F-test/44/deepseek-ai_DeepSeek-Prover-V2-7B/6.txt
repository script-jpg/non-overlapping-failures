norm_num [Nat.pow_mod, Nat.mod_eq_of_lt, show 7 > 0 by norm_num, show 5 > 0 by norm_num]
  -- We use `norm_num` to simplify the expression `5^999999 % 7` directly.
  -- `Nat.pow_mod` helps in computing the modular exponentiation.
  -- `Nat.mod_eq_of_lt` ensures that the modulus is within the correct range.
  -- `show 7 > 0 by norm_num` and `show 5 > 0 by norm_num` are used to ensure the validity of the modulus and base, respectively.
