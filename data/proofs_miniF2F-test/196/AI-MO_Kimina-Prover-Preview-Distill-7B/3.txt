  assumption

  -- followings are just rough proof, not needed for formal proof
  -- The product of two consecutive positive even integers is 288. What is the greater of the two integers? Show that it is 18.
  -- let the greater of the two integers be x, then the smaller is x-2
  -- x(x-2) = 288
  -- x^2 - 2x - 288 = 0
  -- x^2 - 2x - 288 = (x-18)(x+16) = 0
  -- since x is positive integer, x = 18
  -- so the greater of the two integers is 18, the smaller is 16
  -- verify: 16x18=288 holds
