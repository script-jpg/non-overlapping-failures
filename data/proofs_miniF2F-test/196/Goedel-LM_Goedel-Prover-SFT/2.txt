  Given two consecutive positive even integers \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( m = n + 2 \) and their product is 288, we need to show that the greater integer \( m \) is 18.
  1. Substitute \( m = n + 2 \) into the equation \( m \cdot n = 288 \).
  2. This results in \( (n + 2) \cdot n = 288 \).
  3. Expand and simplify the equation to \( n^2 + 2n = 288 \).
  4. Add 2 to both sides to isolate the quadratic term: \( n^2 + 2n + 2 = 290 \).
  5. Solve the quadratic equation \( n^2 + 2n + 2 = 290 \) using numerical methods or factoring.
  6. Factor the quadratic equation to \( (n + 18)(n - 16) = 288 \).
  7. Since \( n \) is a positive even integer, \( n = 18 \) is the solution.
  8. Verify that \( m = 18 + 2 = 20 \).
  9. Confirm that \( m = 18 \) satisfies the original conditions.

  -- Substitute m = n + 2 into the equation m * n = 288
  subst m
  -- Use symmetry of equality to show that n * (n + 2) = 288
