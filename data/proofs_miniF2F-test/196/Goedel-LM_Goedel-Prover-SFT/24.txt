  Given two consecutive positive even integers \( m \) and \( n \), we know that their product is 288. We are also given that \( m - n = 2 \). We need to show that the greater of these two integers, \( m \), is 18.
  1. Since \( m \) and \( n \) are even, we can express \( m \) and \( n \) as \( 2k \) for some integer \( k \).
  2. Using the given difference \( m - n = 2 \), we substitute \( m = 2k \) and \( n = 2k - 2 \).
  3. Substituting these into the product equation \( m \cdot n = 288 \), we get \( 2k \cdot (2k - 2) = 288 \).
  4. Simplifying this equation, we obtain \( 4k^2 - 4k = 288 \), which further simplifies to \( k^2 - k = 72 \).
  5. Solving the quadratic equation \( k^2 - k - 72 = 0 \), we find that \( k = 9 \) or \( k = -8 \). Since \( k \) must be a positive integer, we have \( k = 9 \).
  6. Therefore, \( m = 2k = 2 \cdot 9 = 18 \).
