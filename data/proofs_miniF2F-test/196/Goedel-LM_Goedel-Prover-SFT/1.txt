  Given two consecutive positive even integers \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( m \) is greater than \( n \), and their product is 288, we need to show that the greater integer \( m \) is 18.
  1. Since \( m \) and \( n \) are consecutive even integers, we have \( m - n = 2 \).
  2. The product of these integers is given by \( m \times n = 288 \).
  3. We need to solve the system of equations:
     \[
     m - n = 2
     \]
     \[
     m \times n = 288
     \]
  4. Substituting \( m = n + 2 \) into the product equation, we get:
     \[
     (n + 2) \times n = 288
     \]
  5. Expanding and simplifying the equation:
     \[
     n^2 + 2n = 288
     \]
  6. Rearranging the equation to form a standard quadratic equation:
     \[
     n^2 + 2n - 288 = 0
     \]
  7. Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -288 \):
     \[
     n = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-288)}}{2 \times 1}
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 1152}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{1156}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{-2 \pm 34}{2}
     \]
  8. This gives us two solutions for \( n \):
     \[
     n = \frac{32}{2} = 16 \quad \text{and} \quad n = \frac{-36}{2} = -18
     \]
  9. Since \( n \) must be a positive integer, we discard \( n = -18 \) and keep \( n = 16 \).
  10. Substituting \( n = 16 \) back into \( m = n + 2 \):
      \[
      m = 16 + 2 = 18
      \]
  Thus, the greater integer \( m \) is 18.
