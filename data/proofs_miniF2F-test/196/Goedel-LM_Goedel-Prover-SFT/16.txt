  Given two consecutive positive even integers \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( m - n = 2 \) and \( m \times n = 288 \), we need to show that the greater of the two integers, \( m \), is 18.
  1. Start by expressing \( m \) in terms of \( n \) using the equation \( m - n = 2 \). This gives \( m = n + 2 \).
  2. Substitute \( m = n + 2 \) into the equation \( m \times n = 288 \). This results in \( (n + 2) \times n = 288 \).
  3. Expand and simplify the equation: \( n^2 + 2n = 288 \).
  4. Solve the quadratic equation \( n^2 + 2n - 288 = 0 \) to find the value of \( n \).
  5. Use the quadratic formula \( n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \) where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -288 \).
  6. Calculate the discriminant: \( \Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 2^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-288) = 4 + 1152 = 1156 \).
  7. Find the roots: \( n = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{1156}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 34}{2} \).
  8. This gives two solutions: \( n = 16 \) and \( n = -18 \). Since \( n \) must be a positive integer, we select \( n = 16 \).
  9. Substitute \( n = 16 \) back into \( m = n + 2 \) to find \( m \): \( m = 16 + 2 = 18 \).
  Thus, the greater of the two consecutive even integers \( m \) is 18.
