  Given two consecutive positive even integers \( m \) and \( n \) such that their product is 288, we need to show that the greater of the two integers is 18. We start by using the property of even numbers and algebraic manipulation to find the values of \( m \) and \( n \).
  1. Since \( m \) and \( n \) are even, we can express \( m \) as \( 2k \) and \( n \) as \( 2(k-1) \) for some integer \( k \).
  2. The difference between \( m \) and \( n \) is given by \( m - n = 2 \).
  3. Substituting the expressions for \( m \) and \( n \) into the difference equation, we get \( 2k - 2(k-1) = 2 \).
  4. Simplifying this equation, we find \( 2k - 2k + 2 = 2 \), which simplifies to \( 2 = 2 \).
  5. This confirms that the equations are consistent.
  6. Substituting \( m = 2k \) and \( n = 2(k-1) \) into the product equation \( m \cdot n = 288 \), we get \( 2k \cdot 2(k-1) = 288 \).
  7. Simplifying this, we obtain \( 4k(k-1) = 288 \).
  8. Dividing both sides by 4, we get \( k(k-1) = 72 \).
  9. Solving this quadratic equation, we find \( k = 9 \) or \( k = -8 \). Since \( k \) must be a positive integer, we take \( k = 9 \).
  10. Substituting \( k = 9 \) back into the expressions for \( m \) and \( n \), we get \( m = 2 \cdot 9 = 18 \) and \( n = 2 \cdot (9 - 1) = 16 \).
  11. Therefore, the greater of the two integers is \( m = 18 \).
