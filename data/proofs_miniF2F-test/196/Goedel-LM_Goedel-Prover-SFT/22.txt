  Given two consecutive positive even integers \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( m = n + 2 \) and their product is 288, we need to show that the greater integer \( m \) is 18.
  1. Substitute \( m = n + 2 \) into the equation \( m \cdot n = 288 \).
  2. This results in the equation \( (n + 2) \cdot n = 288 \).
  3. Expand and simplify the equation to \( n^2 + 2n = 288 \).
  4. Solve the quadratic equation \( n^2 + 2n - 288 = 0 \) using numerical methods or factoring.
  5. Find that \( n = 14 \) is a solution.
  6. Substitute \( n = 14 \) back into \( m = n + 2 \) to get \( m = 16 \).
  7. Verify that \( m = 16 \) is indeed the correct solution by checking the conditions.
