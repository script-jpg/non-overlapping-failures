  Given two consecutive positive even integers \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( m - n = 2 \) and \( m \times n = 288 \), we need to show that the greater integer \( m \) is 18.
  1. From the given conditions, we have:
     \[
     m - n = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad m \times n = 288
     \]
  2. Since \( m \) and \( n \) are even, we can express \( m \) as \( 2k \) and \( n \) as \( 2l \) for some integers \( k \) and \( l \).
  3. Substituting these into the difference equation:
     \[
     2k - 2l = 2 \implies k - l = 1
     \]
  4. Substituting these into the product equation:
     \[
     (2k) \times (2l) = 288 \implies 4kl = 288 \implies kl = 72
     \]
  5. We now have two equations:
     \[
     k - l = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad kl = 72
     \]
  6. Solving the first equation for \( k \):
     \[
     k = l + 1
     \]
  7. Substituting \( k = l + 1 \) into \( kl = 72 \):
     \[
     (l + 1)l = 72 \implies l^2 + l = 72
     \]
  8. Solving the quadratic equation \( l^2 + l - 72 = 0 \):
     \[
     l = 8 \quad \text{(since \( l \) is an integer)}
     \]
  9. Substituting \( l = 8 \) back into \( k = l + 1 \):
     \[
     k = 9
     \]
  10. Therefore, \( m = 2k = 2 \times 9 = 18 \) and \( n = 2l = 2 \times 8 = 16 \).
