  Given two consecutive positive even integers \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( n = m - 2 \) and \( m \cdot n = 288 \), we need to show that the greater of these integers is 18.
  1. Substitute \( n = m - 2 \) into the equation \( m \cdot n = 288 \).
  2. Simplify the resulting equation to \( m \cdot (m - 2) = 288 \).
  3. Solve the quadratic equation \( m^2 - 2m - 288 = 0 \) to find the value of \( m \).
  4. Verify that the positive solution to the quadratic equation is 18.
