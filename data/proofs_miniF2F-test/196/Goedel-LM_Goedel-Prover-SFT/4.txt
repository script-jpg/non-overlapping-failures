  Given two consecutive positive even integers \( m \) and \( n \), we know that their product is 288 and their difference is 2. We need to show that the greater of these integers is 18.
  1. Since \( m \) and \( n \) are consecutive even integers, we can express \( m \) as \( n + 2 \).
  2. Substituting \( m = n + 2 \) into the product equation \( m \cdot n = 288 \), we get \( (n + 2) \cdot n = 288 \).
  3. Expanding and simplifying this equation, we obtain \( n^2 + 2n = 288 \).
  4. Rearranging the equation, we have \( n^2 + 2n - 288 = 0 \).
  5. Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -288 \), we find the roots.
  6. The discriminant \( \Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-288) = 4 + 1152 = 1156 \).
  7. Since the discriminant is positive, there are two real solutions. Calculating these solutions, we get \( n = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{1156}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 34}{2} \).
  8. This gives us two solutions: \( n = \frac{32}{2} = 16 \) and \( n = \frac{-36}{2} = -18 \).
  9. Since \( n \) must be a positive integer, we select \( n = 16 \).
  10. Substituting \( n = 16 \) back into \( m = n + 2 \), we find \( m = 16 + 2 = 18 \).
  Thus, the greater of the two integers is \( m = 18 \).
