  Given two consecutive positive even integers \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( m \cdot n = 288 \) and \( m - n = 2 \), we need to show that the greater of the two integers, \( m \), is 18.
  1. From the given conditions, we know:
     - \( m \) is even.
     - \( n \) is even.
     - \( m - n = 2 \).
     - \( m \cdot n = 288 \).
  2. Since \( m \) and \( n \) are even, we can express \( m \) as \( 2k \) and \( n \) as \( 2l \) for some integers \( k \) and \( l \).
  3. Substituting these into the difference condition \( m - n = 2 \), we get:
     \[
     2k - 2l = 2 \implies k - l = 1
     \]
  4. Substituting these into the product condition \( m \cdot n = 288 \), we get:
     \[
     (2k) \cdot (2l) = 288 \implies 4kl = 288 \implies kl = 72
     \]
  5. Solving for \( k \) and \( l \) such that \( k - l = 1 \) and \( kl = 72 \), we find:
     \[
     k = 9, l = 8 \quad \text{or} \quad k = -9, l = -8
     \]
  6. Since \( k \) and \( l \) are integers, we take \( k = 9 \) and \( l = 8 \).
  7. Therefore, \( m = 2k = 2 \cdot 9 = 18 \).

  -- We know that the product of m and n is 288.
  have h₄ : m * n = 288 := h₃
  -- We know that the difference between m and n is 2.
  have h₅ : m - n = 2 := h₂
  -- We need to show that m is 18.
  have h₆ : m = 18 := by
    -- Use the fact that m and n are even to express m as 2k and n as 2l.
    -- Then, use the difference and product conditions to solve for m.
