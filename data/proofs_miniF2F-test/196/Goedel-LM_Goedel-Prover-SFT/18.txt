  Given two consecutive positive even integers \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( m - n = 2 \) and \( m \times n = 288 \), we need to show that the greater of the two integers is 18.
  1. Express \( m \) in terms of \( n \): Since \( m \) is the next even number after \( n \), we have \( m = n + 2 \).
  2. Substitute \( m = n + 2 \) into the product equation \( m \times n = 288 \):
     \[
     (n + 2) \times n = 288
     \]
  3. Expand and simplify the equation:
     \[
     n^2 + 2n = 288
     \]
  4. Rearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic equation:
     \[
     n^2 + 2n - 288 = 0
     \]
  5. Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \):
     \[
     n = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 1152}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{1156}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 34}{2}
     \]
  6. This gives two solutions for \( n \):
     \[
     n = \frac{32}{2} = 16 \quad \text{and} \quad n = \frac{-36}{2} = -18
     \]
  7. Since \( n \) must be a positive integer, we select \( n = 16 \).
  8. Substitute \( n = 16 \) back into \( m = n + 2 \):
     \[
     m = 16 + 2 = 18
     \]
  Thus, the greater of the two integers is \( m = 18 \).
