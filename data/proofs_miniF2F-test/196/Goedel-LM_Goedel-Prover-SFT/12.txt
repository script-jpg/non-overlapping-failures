  Given two consecutive positive even integers \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( m - n = 2 \) and \( m \times n = 288 \), we need to show that the greater of the two integers, \( m \), is 18.
  1. Since \( m \) and \( n \) are even, we can express \( m \) and \( n \) as \( 2k \) and \( 2(k-1) \) respectively, where \( k \) is a positive integer.
  2. Substituting these expressions into the equation \( m - n = 2 \), we get \( 2k - 2(k-1) = 2 \), which simplifies to \( 2k - 2k + 2 = 2 \), confirming that \( m - n = 2 \).
  3. Substituting \( m = 2k \) and \( n = 2(k-1) \) into the equation \( m \times n = 288 \), we get \( 2k \times 2(k-1) = 288 \), which simplifies to \( 4k(k-1) = 288 \).
  4. Dividing both sides by 4, we obtain \( k(k-1) = 72 \).
  5. Solving the quadratic equation \( k^2 - k - 72 = 0 \), we find that \( k = 9 \) is the only positive integer solution.
  6. Substituting \( k = 9 \) back into the expressions for \( m \) and \( n \), we get \( m = 2 \times 9 = 18 \) and \( n = 2 \times (9 - 1) = 16 \).
  7. Therefore, the greater of the two integers, \( m \), is indeed 18.

    -- Since m and n are even, we can express m and n as 2k and 2(k-1) respectively, where k is a positive integer.
    -- Substituting these expressions into the equation m - n = 2, we get 2k - 2(k-1) = 2, which simplifies to 2k - 2k + 2 = 2, confirming that m - n = 2.
    -- Substituting m = 2k and n = 2(k-1) into the equation m * n = 288, we get 2k * 2(k-1) = 288, which simplifies to 4k(k-1) = 288.
    -- Dividing both sides by 4, we obtain k(k-1) = 72.
    -- Solving the quadratic equation k^2 - k - 72 = 0, we find that k = 9 is the only positive integer solution.
    -- Substituting k = 9 back into the expressions for m and n, we get m = 2 * 9 = 18 and n = 2 * (9 - 1) = 16.
    -- Therefore, the greater of the two integers, m, is indeed 18.
