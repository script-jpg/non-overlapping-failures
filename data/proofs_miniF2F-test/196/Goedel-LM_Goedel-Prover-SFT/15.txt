  Given two consecutive positive even integers \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( m > n \), \( m - n = 2 \), and \( m \cdot n = 288 \), we need to show that the greater integer \( m \) is 18.
  1. Since \( m \) and \( n \) are even, we can express \( m \) and \( n \) as \( 2k + 2 \) and \( 2k \) respectively for some integer \( k \).
  2. From \( m - n = 2 \), we substitute \( m = 2k + 2 \) and \( n = 2k \) to get \( (2k + 2) - 2k = 2 \), which simplifies to \( 2 = 2 \), confirming the difference is correct.
  3. From \( m \cdot n = 288 \), we substitute \( m = 2k + 2 \) and \( n = 2k \) to get \( (2k + 2) \cdot 2k = 288 \).
  4. Expanding and simplifying the equation \( (2k + 2) \cdot 2k = 288 \), we get \( 4k^2 + 4k = 288 \).
  5. Dividing the entire equation by 4, we obtain \( k^2 + k = 72 \).
  6. Solving the quadratic equation \( k^2 + k - 72 = 0 \), we find that \( k = 8 \) or \( k = -9 \). Since \( k \) must be a positive integer, we select \( k = 8 \).
  7. Substituting \( k = 8 \) back into \( m = 2k + 2 \), we get \( m = 2 \cdot 8 + 2 = 18 \).
  Thus, the greater integer \( m \) is indeed 18.

    -- Using the given conditions, we solve for m.
    -- We know m * n = 288 and m - n = 2.
    -- We can use these to find m.
