  Given two consecutive positive even integers \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( m = n + 2 \) and the product of these integers is 288, we need to show that the greater integer \( m \) is 18.
  1. Substitute \( m = n + 2 \) into the product equation \( m \cdot n = 288 \).
  2. This results in \( (n + 2) \cdot n = 288 \).
  3. Expand and simplify the equation to \( n^2 + 2n = 288 \).
  4. Solve the quadratic equation \( n^2 + 2n - 288 = 0 \) to find the value of \( n \).
  5. Use the quadratic formula \( n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \) where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -288 \).
  6. Calculate the discriminant: \( \Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-288) = 4 + 1152 = 1156 \).
  7. Since the discriminant is positive, there are two real solutions: \( n = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{1156}}{2} \).
  8. Simplify the solutions: \( n = \frac{-2 \pm 34}{2} \).
  9. This gives two solutions: \( n = \frac{32}{2} = 16 \) and \( n = \frac{-36}{2} = -18 \).
  10. Since \( n \) must be a positive integer, we select \( n = 16 \).
  11. Substitute \( n = 16 \) back into \( m = n + 2 \) to find \( m \): \( m = 16 + 2 = 18 \).
  Thus, the greater integer \( m \) is 18.
