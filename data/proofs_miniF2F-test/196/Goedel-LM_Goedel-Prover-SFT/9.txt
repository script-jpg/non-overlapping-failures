  Given two consecutive positive even integers \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( m - n = 2 \) and \( m \times n = 288 \), we need to show that the greater integer \( m \) is 18.
  1. Since \( m \) and \( n \) are consecutive even integers, we have \( m = n + 2 \).
  2. Substituting \( m = n + 2 \) into the equation \( m \times n = 288 \), we get \( (n + 2) \times n = 288 \).
  3. Expanding and simplifying this equation, we obtain \( n^2 + 2n = 288 \).
  4. Rearranging the equation, we have \( n^2 + 2n - 288 = 0 \).
  5. This is a quadratic equation in \( n \). Solving for \( n \) using the quadratic formula \( n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -288 \):
     \[
     n = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-288)}}{2 \times 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 1152}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{1156}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 34}{2}
     \]
  6. This gives us two solutions: \( n = \frac{32}{2} = 16 \) and \( n = \frac{-36}{2} = -18 \). Since \( n \) must be a positive integer, we have \( n = 16 \).
  7. Substituting \( n = 16 \) back into \( m = n + 2 \), we get \( m = 16 + 2 = 18 \).
  Thus, the greater integer \( m \) is 18.
