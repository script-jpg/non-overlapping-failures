  Given two consecutive positive even integers \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( m - n = 2 \) and \( m \cdot n = 288 \), we need to show that the greater integer \( m \) is 18.
  1. From the given conditions, we know:
     \[
     m - n = 2 \quad \text{(1)}
     \]
     \[
     m \cdot n = 288 \quad \text{(2)}
     \]
  2. We can express \( m \) in terms of \( n \) using equation (1):
     \[
     m = n + 2
     \]
  3. Substitute \( m = n + 2 \) into equation (2):
     \[
     (n + 2) \cdot n = 288
     \]
  4. Expand and simplify the equation:
     \[
     n^2 + 2n = 288
     \]
  5. Rearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic equation:
     \[
     n^2 + 2n - 288 = 0
     \]
  6. Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -288 \):
     \[
     n = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-288)}}{2 \cdot 1}
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 1152}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{1156}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{-2 \pm 34}{2}
     \]
  7. This gives two solutions for \( n \):
     \[
     n = \frac{32}{2} = 16 \quad \text{and} \quad n = \frac{-36}{2} = -18
     \]
  8. Since \( n \) must be a positive integer, we have \( n = 16 \).
  9. Substitute \( n = 16 \) back into \( m = n + 2 \):
     \[
     m = 16 + 2 = 18
     \]
  Thus, the greater integer \( m \) is 18.
