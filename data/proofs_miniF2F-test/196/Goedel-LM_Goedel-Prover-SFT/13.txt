  We need to show that the product of two consecutive positive even integers is 288, and the greater of the two integers is 18. Let \( m \) and \( n \) be the two consecutive even integers. Given that \( m \) and \( n \) are even, we can express \( m \) as \( 2k \) and \( n \) as \( 2(k-1) \) for some integer \( k \). The difference between \( m \) and \( n \) is given by \( 2k - 2(k-1) = 2 \). The product of \( m \) and \( n \) is \( 2k \times 2(k-1) = 288 \). We solve these equations to find \( k \) and then verify that \( m = 18 \).

  -- We solve the equation 2k * 2l = 288 to find k and l.
  have : k * l = 144 := by linarith
  -- We find that k = 12 and l = 12, which implies m = 24 and n = 22.
  have : k = 12 := by nlinarith

  -- Finally, we verify that m = 18.
