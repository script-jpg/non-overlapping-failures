  Given two consecutive positive even integers \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( m = n + 2 \) and their product is 288, we need to show that the greater integer \( m \) is 18. We start by expressing \( m \) in terms of \( n \) and then use the given product to solve for \( n \). Finally, we verify that \( m = 18 \).

  -- We start by expressing m in terms of n using the given difference.
  have hm : m = n + 2 := by
    -- Using the difference condition h₂, we rewrite m as n + 2.
    omega
  -- Substitute m = n + 2 into the product equation.

  -- Now we have (n + 2) * n = 288. Simplify and solve for n.
  have hn : n = 16 := by
    -- Expand and rearrange the equation to form a quadratic equation.
    nlinarith
  -- Substitute n = 16 back into the expression for m.
  rw [hn] at hm
  -- Now we have m = 16 + 2. Simplify to get the final result.
