  To prove that \(a^2 b(a-b) + b^2 c(b-c) + c^2 a(c-a) \geq 0\) for the sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) of a triangle, we can use the non-negativity of squares and some algebraic manipulations. Specifically, we can use the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative. We will consider various expressions involving \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) and show that their squares are non-negative, which will imply the desired inequality.
