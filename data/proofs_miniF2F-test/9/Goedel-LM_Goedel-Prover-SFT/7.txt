  To prove that for the lengths \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) of the sides of a triangle, the expression \(a^2 b(a-b) + b^2 c(b-c) + c^2 a(c-a)\) is non-negative, we can use the properties of the triangle inequalities and the non-negativity of squares. Specifically, we will show that the expression is non-negative by considering the non-negativity of the squares of the differences between the sides and using the given inequalities.
