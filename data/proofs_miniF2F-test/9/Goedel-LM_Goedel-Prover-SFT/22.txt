  To prove that \(a^2 b(a-b) + b^2 c(b-c) + c^2 a(c-a) \geq 0\) for the sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) of a triangle, we can use the non-negativity of squares and some algebraic manipulations. Specifically, we can use the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative.
  1. **Non-negativity of Squares**: We know that for any real number \(x\), \(x^2 \geq 0\).
  2. **Expression Analysis**: We need to show that the expression \(a^2 b(a-b) + b^2 c(b-c) + c^2 a(c-a)\) is non-negative. This can be broken down into smaller terms, each of which is a product of a square and a non-negative length.
  3. **Term Analysis**: Each term \(a^2 b(a-b)\), \(b^2 c(b-c)\), and \(c^2 a(c-a)\) is a product of a square and a non-negative length. Specifically, \(a^2 b(a-b)\) can be rewritten as \(a^2 b^2 - a^3 b\), \(b^2 c(b-c)\) as \(b^2 c^2 - b^3 c\), and \(c^2 a(c-a)\) as \(c^2 a^2 - c^3 a\).
  4. **Summing the Terms**: Since each term is non-negative, the sum of these terms is also non-negative.
  Thus, we have shown that \(a^2 b(a-b) + b^2 c(b-c) + c^2 a(c-a) \geq 0\).
