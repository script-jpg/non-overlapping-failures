  Given a positive integer \( n \) such that \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{n} \) is an integer, we need to determine which of the following statements is not true:
  - \( 2 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( 3 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( 6 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( 7 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( n > 84 \)
  To show that \( n > 84 \), we start by analyzing the given equation \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{n} = k \) for some integer \( k \). We need to find a common denominator for the fractions and then determine the smallest \( n \) that satisfies the equation.
