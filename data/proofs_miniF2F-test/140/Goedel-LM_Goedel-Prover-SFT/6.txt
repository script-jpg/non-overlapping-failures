  Given a positive integer \( n \) such that \(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{n}\) is an integer, we need to determine which of the following statements is not true:
  - \( 2 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( 3 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( 6 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( 7 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( n > 84 \)
  To show that \( n > 84 \), we start by analyzing the given condition that \(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{n}\) is an integer. This implies that the sum of these fractions is an integer, which can only happen if each term individually is also an integer.
  First, we calculate the sum of the fractions:
  \[
  \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{n} = \frac{21}{84} + \frac{28}{84} + \frac{12}{84} + \frac{14}{84} = \frac{75}{84} + \frac{14}{84} = \frac{89}{84}
  \]
  Since this sum is an integer, \(\frac{89}{84}\) must be an integer. This is only possible if \( n \) is such that the sum of these fractions equals an integer. By simplifying, we find that \( n \) must be 42 to satisfy this condition.
