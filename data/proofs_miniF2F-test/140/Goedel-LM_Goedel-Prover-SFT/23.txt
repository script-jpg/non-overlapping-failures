  Given a positive integer \( n \) such that \(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{n}\) is an integer, we need to determine which of the following statements is not true:
  - \(2\) divides \(n\)
  - \(3\) divides \(n\)
  - \(6\) divides \(n\)
  - \(7\) divides \(n\)
  - \(n > 84\)
  To show that \(n > 84\), we start by analyzing the given condition. The sum \(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{n}\) is an integer, implying that the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators must be a divisor of \(n\). The LCM of \(2, 3, 7, 1\) is \(42\). Therefore, \(n\) must be a multiple of \(42\). Since \(n\) is a positive integer, the smallest multiple of \(42\) greater than \(84\) is \(42\) itself. Hence, \(n > 84\) is false, and the statement that \(n > 84\) is not true.

  -- Since the LCM of 2, 3, 7, 1 is 42, n must be a multiple of 42.
  -- The smallest multiple of 42 greater than 84 is 42 itself.
  -- Therefore, n > 84 is false, and the statement that n > 84 is not true.
