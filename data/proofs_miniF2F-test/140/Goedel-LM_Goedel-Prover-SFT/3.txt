  Given a positive integer \( n \) such that \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{n} \) is an integer, we need to determine which of the following statements is not true:
  - \( 2 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( 3 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( 6 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( 7 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( n > 84 \)
  Show that it is \( n > 84 \).

  have h : n = 42 := by
    norm_num at h₁
    -- Simplify the given condition to find the value of n
    ring_nf at h₁
    -- Normalize the expression to simplify it further
    field_simp at h₁
    -- Simplify the fractions to their lowest terms
    norm_cast at h₁
    -- Ensure the expression is in the correct type (natural number)
    norm_num at h₁
    -- Simplify the numerical constants
    ring_nf at h₁
    -- Normalize the expression again to ensure it is in the simplest form
    omega
  -- Use the omega tactic to solve the inequality and find the exact value of n
  simp [h]
  -- Simplify the final expression to show that n = 42
