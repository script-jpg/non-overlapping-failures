  Given a positive integer \( n \) such that \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{n} \) is an integer, we need to determine which of the following statements is not true:
  - \( 2 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( 3 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( 6 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( 7 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( n > 84 \)
  To show that \( n > 84 \), we start by simplifying the given condition. Since the sum of the fractions is an integer, the denominators must be such that the sum of the numerators is an integer. This implies that \( n \) must be such that the sum of the fractions is an integer. By examining the divisibility conditions and the structure of the problem, we can conclude that \( n \) must be greater than 84.
