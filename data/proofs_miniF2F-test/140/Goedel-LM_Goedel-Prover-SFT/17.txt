  Given a positive integer \( n \) such that \(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{n}\) is an integer, we need to determine which of the following statements is not true:
  - \( 2 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( 3 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( 6 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( 7 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( n > 84 \)
  To show that \( n > 84 \), we start by analyzing the given condition. The sum \(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{n}\) being an integer implies that the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators must be a power of 2. This LCM can be calculated as \( 2 \times 3 \times 7 = 42 \). Therefore, \( n \) must be a multiple of 42. Since \( n \) is a positive integer, the smallest such \( n \) is 42, confirming that \( n > 84 \).
