  Given a positive integer \( n \) such that \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{n} \) is an integer, we need to determine which of the following statements is not true:
  - \( 2 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( 3 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( 6 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( 7 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( n > 84 \)
  First, we express the sum \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{n} \) in a common denominator form. The least common multiple of 2, 3, 7, and \( n \) is 42. Thus, we can rewrite the sum as:
  \[
  \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{n} = \frac{21}{42} + \frac{14}{42} + \frac{6}{42} + \frac{42}{42} = \frac{21 + 14 + 6 + 42}{42} = \frac{83}{42}
  \]
  Since \( \frac{83}{42} \) is an integer, \( n \) must be 42 to satisfy the condition. Therefore, statement \( \mathrm{(E)} \) is false, and we conclude that \( n > 84 \) is not true.
