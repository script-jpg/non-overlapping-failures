  Given a positive integer \( n \) such that \(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{n}\) is an integer, we need to determine which of the following statements is not true:
  - \( 2 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( 3 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( 6 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( 7 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( n > 84 \)
  To solve this, we start by simplifying the given expression. The expression \(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{n}\) is an integer, which implies that the denominators of these fractions must be a common multiple. The least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators is 42. Therefore, \( n \) must be 42 to satisfy the condition that the sum of these fractions is an integer.
