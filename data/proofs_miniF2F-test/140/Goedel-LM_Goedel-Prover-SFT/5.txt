  Given a positive integer \( n \) such that \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{n} \) is an integer, we need to determine which of the following statements is not true:
  - \( 2 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( 3 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( 6 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( 7 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( n > 84 \)
  To show that \( n > 84 \), we start by analyzing the given condition. The sum \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{n} \) being an integer implies that the denominators must be such that their sum is divisible by \( 1 \). This is only possible if \( n \) is a multiple of \( 42 \), as the least common multiple of \( 2, 3, 7, \) and \( n \) is \( 42 \). Therefore, \( n \) cannot be less than or equal to \( 84 \).
