  Given a positive integer \( n \) such that \(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{n}\) is an integer, we need to determine which of the following statements is not true:
  - \( 2 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( 3 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( 6 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( 7 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( n > 84 \)
  To show that \( n > 84 \), we start by simplifying the given condition. Since \(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{n}\) is an integer, the sum of these fractions must be an integer. This implies that the sum of the denominators must be a multiple of the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators. The LCM of 2, 3, 7, and \( n \) is 42. Therefore, \( n \) must be greater than 84 to satisfy the condition that the sum of these fractions is an integer.
