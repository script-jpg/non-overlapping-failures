  Given a positive integer \( n \) such that \(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{n}\) is an integer, we need to determine which of the following statements is not true:
  - \(2\) divides \(n\)
  - \(3\) divides \(n\)
  - \(6\) divides \(n\)
  - \(7\) divides \(n\)
  - \(n > 84\)
  To solve this, we start by simplifying the given condition \(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{n}\) is an integer. This implies that the denominators of the fractions must be such that the sum of these fractions results in an integer.
  First, we find the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators \(2, 3, 7, n\). The LCM of these numbers is \(42\). Therefore, the denominators must be a multiple of \(42\).
  Given that \(n\) is a positive integer and the denominators are multiples of \(42\), we can conclude that \(n\) must be at least \(42\) to satisfy the condition that the sum of the fractions is an integer.
  Thus, the statement that \(n > 84\) is the only statement that is not true among the given options.
