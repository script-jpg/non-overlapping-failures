  Given a positive integer \( n \) such that \(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{n}\) is an integer, we need to show that \( n > 84 \).
  1. First, we simplify the expression \(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{n}\) by finding a common denominator.
  2. The least common multiple of 2, 3, 7, and \( n \) is 42.
  3. For the expression to be an integer, the denominator must be 42.
  4. Therefore, \( n \) must be greater than 84.
