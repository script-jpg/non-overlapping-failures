  Given a positive integer \( n \) such that \(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{n}\) is an integer, we need to determine which of the following statements is not true:
  - \( 2 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( 3 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( 6 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( 7 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( n > 84 \)
  To solve this, we start by simplifying the given expression. The sum \(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{7}\) can be expressed as a single fraction. The least common multiple of the denominators \( 2, 3, 7, \) and \( n \) is 42. Therefore, the expression \(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{n}\) simplifies to \(\frac{21}{42} + \frac{14}{42} + \frac{6}{42} + \frac{42}{42} = \frac{77}{42} + \frac{42}{42} = \frac{119}{42}\).
  Given that this sum is an integer, \( \frac{119}{42} \) must be an integer. This implies that \( n \) must be such that the sum of these fractions results in an integer. By simplifying the fractions, we find that \( n \) must be 42 to satisfy this condition.
