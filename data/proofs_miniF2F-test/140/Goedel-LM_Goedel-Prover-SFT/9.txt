  Given a positive integer \( n \) such that \(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{n}\) is an integer, we need to show that \( n = 42 \). This involves analyzing the denominators of the fractions and their sum.
  1. The denominators of the fractions are \( 2, 3, 7, \) and \( n \).
  2. The sum of these fractions is \(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{n}\).
  3. For the sum to be an integer, the denominators must be such that the least common multiple of \( 2, 3, 7, \) and \( n \) is a multiple of \( 2 \times 3 \times 7 \times n \).
  4. The least common multiple of \( 2, 3, 7, \) and \( n \) is \( 42 \).
  5. Therefore, \( n \) must be such that \( 42 \) divides \( n \).
  6. The only positive integer \( n \) that satisfies this condition is \( n = 42 \).
