  Given a positive integer \( n \) such that \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{n} \) is an integer, we need to show that \( n > 84 \).
  First, we note that the denominators of the fractions are 2, 3, 7, and \( n \). The least common multiple of these denominators is 42. Therefore, \( n \) must be a multiple of 42.
  Since \( n \) is a positive integer, the smallest multiple of 42 greater than 0 is 42 itself. Hence, \( n \) must be greater than 84.

  -- Since the sum of these fractions is an integer, the least common multiple of their denominators must be a factor of n.
  -- The least common multiple of 2, 3, 7, and n is 42.
  -- Therefore, n must be a multiple of 42.
  -- Since n is a positive integer, the smallest multiple of 42 greater than 0 is 42 itself.
  -- Hence, n must be greater than 84.

  -- If n is not greater than 84, then n ≤ 84.
  -- However, since n must be a multiple of 42 and greater than 0, the smallest possible value for n is 42.
  -- Therefore, n cannot be less than or equal to 84.
  -- This leads to a contradiction.
