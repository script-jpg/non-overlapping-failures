  Given a positive integer \( n \) such that \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{n} \) is an integer, we need to determine which of the following statements is not true:
  - \( 2 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( 3 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( 6 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( 7 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( n > 84 \)
  To show that \( n > 84 \), we start by analyzing the given condition. Since \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{n} \) is an integer, the sum of these fractions must be an integer. This implies that the least common multiple (LCM) of the denominators must be a multiple of \( n \).
  First, we calculate the LCM of the denominators:
  \[ \text{LCM}(2, 3, 7, n) = 42 \]
  Since \( 42 \) must be divisible by \( n \), it follows that \( n \) must be a divisor of \( 42 \). The divisors of \( 42 \) are \( 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42 \). Among these, the only divisors that are greater than \( 84 \) are \( 42 \) itself. Therefore, \( n \) must be \( 42 \).
  Thus, the statement that \( n > 84 \) is false, and the correct answer is \( \text{E} \).
