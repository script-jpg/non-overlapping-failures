  Given a positive integer \( n \) such that \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{n} \) is an integer, we need to determine if any of the following statements is true:
  - \( 2 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( 3 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( 6 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( 7 \) divides \( n \)
  - \( n > 84 \)
  We will show that \( n = 42 \) satisfies the given condition and thus \( n > 84 \) is false.

  -- Since the sum of the fractions equals an integer, we can conclude that n must be such that the sum is an integer.
  -- By checking the divisibility conditions and the sum, we find that n = 42 satisfies the given condition.
