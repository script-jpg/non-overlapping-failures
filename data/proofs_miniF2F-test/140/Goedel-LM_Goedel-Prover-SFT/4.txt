  Given a positive integer \( n \) such that \(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{n}\) is an integer, we need to determine which of the following statements is not true:
  - \(\mathrm{(A)}\ 2 \text{ divides } n\)
  - \(\mathrm{(B)}\ 3 \text{ divides } n\)
  - \(\mathrm{(C)}\ 6 \text{ divides } n\)
  - \(\mathrm{(D)}\ 7 \text{ divides } n\)
  - \(\mathrm{(E)}\ n > 84\)
  First, we simplify the given equation \(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{n} = k\) for some integer \( k \). By finding a common denominator, we get:
  \[
  \frac{21n + 14n + 6n + 12}{42n} = k \implies \frac{41n + 12}{42n} = k \implies 41n + 12 = 42nk \implies 41n + 12 = 42nk
  \]
  Since \( 42n \) is a multiple of 42, we can equate the coefficients of \( n \) and the constant terms. This implies:
  \[
  41n + 12 = 42nk \implies 41n + 12 = 42nk
  \]
  Given that \( n \) is a positive integer, we solve for \( n \) by isolating it in the equation. We find that \( n \) must be such that the equation holds true. By solving the equation, we find that \( n = 42 \) satisfies the equation.
