-- We do not need to consider the case when $n$ is odd first.  Instead, we consider the [lcm](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/LCM) $l$ of $2$, $3$, $7$ and $n$.  Clearly, $l$ is a divisor of $42$.  If $l$ is not equal to $42$, then $l$ is one of $1$, $2$, $3$, $6$, $7$, $14$, or $21$. The problem statement is asking us to show that $l$ must be $42$.  So, let's assume that $l$ is one of those numbers.

  -- Notice that $\frac 12 + \frac 13 + \frac 17 + \frac 1n = \frac{41}{42} + \frac 1n$.  This sum is equal to $\frac{l}{42} + \frac 1n = \frac{ln+42}{42n}$.  This fraction is in reduced terms because the denominator is a divisor of $42$.  This means that the fraction is equal to one in reduced terms.  Hence, $ln+42 = 42n$ and $l = 42(n-1)$.  This equation shows that $l$ is divisible by $42$.  However, we already know that $l$ is one of $1$, $2$, $3$, $6$, $7$, $14$, or $21$. This is a contradiction.  Hence, $l$ must be $42$.

  -- Now, let's consider the prime factorization of $l$.  Since $l$ is divisible by $2$, $3$ and $7$, it must have them in its prime factorization.  Since $l$ is not divisible by any of the other numbers besides those listed, it cannot have any other prime factors.  Thus, $l$ is equal to $2^a3^b7^c$ for $a,b,c$ nonnegative integers.  Since $l$ is divisible by $42 = 2^13^17^1$, we have $a \geq 1$, $b \geq 1$, and $c \geq 1$.  If $a \geq 2$, then $l$ is divisible by $2^2 = 4$, but $4$ does not divide $\frac{41}{42} + \frac 1n$, so $a = 1$.  If $b \geq 2$, then $l$ is divisible by $3^2 = 9$, but $9$ does not divide $\frac{41}{42} + \frac 1n$, so $b = 1$.  If $c \geq 2$, then $l$ is divisible by $7^2 = 49$, but $49$ does not divide $\frac{41}{42} + \frac 1n$, so $c = 1$.  Hence, $l = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 7 = \boxed{42}$.
