  -- Now, let's think about how to approach this. We have a fraction equal to an integer,
  -- and we need to determine the properties of the denominator.
  -- The key insight is that if a fraction is an integer, then its denominator must divide the numerator.
  have h₄ : 42 * n / 42 = 1 := by

  -- This means that 42 * n / 42 = 1, which implies n = 42.
