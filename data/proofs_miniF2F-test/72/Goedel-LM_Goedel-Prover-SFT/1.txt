  To show that the smallest integer greater than 10 that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube is 64, we proceed as follows:
  1. Assume \( n \) is such an integer.
  2. Given \( 10 \leq n \), \( n \) is at least 10.
  3. There exists a natural number \( x \) such that \( x^2 = n \), meaning \( n \) is a perfect square.
  4. There exists a natural number \( t \) such that \( t^3 = n \), meaning \( n \) is a perfect cube.
  5. We need to show that \( 64 \leq n \).
  Given the constraints, we can use the fact that the smallest perfect square greater than 10 that is also a perfect cube is 64. This is because \( 64 = 8^2 \) and \( 64 = 4^3 \).

  -- Extract the values of x and t such that x^2 = n and t^3 = n respectively.
  rcases h₁ with ⟨x, hx⟩
  rcases h₂ with ⟨t, ht⟩
  -- We know that x and t must be such that their squares and cubes are equal to n respectively.
  have h₃ : x ≥ 8 := by
    -- Since x^2 = n and n is at least 10, we can infer that x must be at least 8 to satisfy x^2 = 64.

    have : x * x < 64 := by nlinarith
    nlinarith
  have h₄ : t ≥ 4 := by
    -- Similarly, since t^3 = n and n is at least 10, we can infer that t must be at least 4 to satisfy t^3 = 64.
    apply Nat.le_of_not_lt
    intro h
    have : t * t * t < 64 := by nlinarith
    nlinarith
  -- Using the inequalities derived from the previous steps, we can conclude that n ≥ 64.
