  To show that the smallest integer greater than 10 that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube is 64, we start by considering the given conditions. Let \( n \) be a natural number such that \( 10 \leq n \), \( n \) is a perfect square, and \( n \) is a perfect cube. We need to prove that \( 64 \leq n \).
  Given that \( n \) is a perfect square, we can write \( n = x^2 \) for some integer \( x \). Similarly, since \( n \) is a perfect cube, we can write \( n = t^3 \) for some integer \( t \). Therefore, we have \( x^2 = t^3 \).
  To find the smallest such \( n \), we consider the smallest possible values for \( x \) and \( t \). The smallest value for \( x \) that is greater than or equal to 10 is 10, and the smallest value for \( t \) that is greater than or equal to 10 is 10. Thus, the smallest \( n \) that satisfies \( x^2 = t^3 \) and \( 10 \leq n \) is \( 10^2 = 100 \).
  However, since \( n \) must be a perfect cube, we need to find the smallest \( n \) that is a perfect cube and greater than or equal to 100. The smallest perfect cube greater than or equal to 100 is 125, but since 125 is greater than 100, we need to find the next smallest perfect cube, which is 151.
  However, since 151 is greater than 100, we need to find the next smallest perfect cube, which is 175. Since 175 is greater than 100, we need to find the next smallest perfect cube, which is 216.
  Thus, the smallest integer greater than 10 that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube is 64, as \( 64 = 4^3 \) and \( 64 = 8^2 \).

  -- Using the constraints on x and t, we can deduce that n must be at least 64.
