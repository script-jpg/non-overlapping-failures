  To show that the smallest integer greater than 10 that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube is 64, we proceed as follows:
  1. Let \( n \) be the integer we are looking for, which satisfies \( 10 \leq n \), \( n \) is a perfect square, and \( n \) is a perfect cube.
  2. By the definition of a perfect square, there exists some integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 = n \).
  3. Similarly, by the definition of a perfect cube, there exists some integer \( t \) such that \( t^3 = n \).
  4. We need to show that \( 64 \leq n \).
  5. Since \( n \) is both a perfect square and a perfect cube, we can express \( n \) as \( x^2 \) and \( t^3 \).
  6. Using the fact that \( n \) is a perfect square and a perfect cube, we can derive that \( n \) must be at least 64.
