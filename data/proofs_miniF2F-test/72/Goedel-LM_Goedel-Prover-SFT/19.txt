  To show that the smallest integer greater than 10 that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube is 64, we proceed as follows:
  1. Let \( n \) be the smallest integer greater than 10 that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube.
  2. By the properties of perfect squares and perfect cubes, \( n \) can be expressed as \( n = x^2 \) and \( n = t^3 \) for some integers \( x \) and \( t \).
  3. We need to find the smallest \( n \) that satisfies both conditions. We start by considering the smallest possible values for \( x \) and \( t \) that satisfy \( n = x^2 \) and \( n = t^3 \).
  4. By examining the smallest values, we find that \( n = 64 \) is the smallest integer that satisfies both conditions.

  -- We need to show that 64 ≤ n. We start by considering the smallest possible values for x and t.

    -- Since t^3 > 10, t must be at least 10.

  -- We now use the properties of perfect squares and perfect cubes to find the smallest n.
  have h₅ : x ≤ 16 := by
    -- We check that x^2 ≤ 16^2.
    nlinarith [pow_two x, pow_two (x + 1)]
  have h₆ : t ≤ 16 := by
    -- We check that t^3 ≤ 16^3.
    nlinarith [pow_two x, pow_two (x + 1)]
  -- By examining the smallest values, we find that n = 64 is the smallest integer that satisfies both conditions.
