  To show that the smallest integer greater than 10 that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube is 64, we start by considering the given conditions. Let \( n \) be a natural number such that \( 10 \leq n \), \( n \) is a perfect square, and \( n \) is a perfect cube. We need to prove that \( 64 \leq n \).
  Given that \( n \) is a perfect square, there exists an integer \( x \) such that \( n = x^2 \). Similarly, since \( n \) is a perfect cube, there exists an integer \( t \) such that \( n = t^3 \). We can then express \( t^3 \) as \( (t-1)^3 + 1 \), which simplifies to \( t^3 = t^2 - t + 1 \).
  To find the smallest \( n \) that satisfies both conditions, we consider the smallest possible values for \( t \) and \( x \). We know that \( t \geq 4 \) because if \( t < 4 \), \( t^3 \) would be less than \( 64 \), which contradicts the requirement that \( n \) is at least \( 64 \).
  Thus, \( t \geq 4 \) and \( x \geq 4 \) (since \( x^2 = n \) and \( t^3 = n \)). We can then calculate the smallest \( n \) as follows:
  - If \( t = 4 \), then \( n = 4^3 = 64 \).
  - If \( t = 5 \), then \( n = 5^3 = 125 \), which is greater than 64.
  Therefore, the smallest \( n \) that is a perfect square and a perfect cube is indeed \( 64 \).
