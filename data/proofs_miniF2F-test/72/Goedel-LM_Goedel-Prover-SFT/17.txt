  To show that the smallest integer greater than 10 that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube is 64, we start by noting that the smallest integer greater than 10 that satisfies these conditions must be a multiple of both 4 and 9. The least common multiple of 4 and 9 is 36, and the next multiple of 36 that is greater than 10 is 64. Therefore, 64 is the smallest integer greater than 10 that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube.
