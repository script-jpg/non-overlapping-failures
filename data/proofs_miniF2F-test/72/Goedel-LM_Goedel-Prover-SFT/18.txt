  To show that the smallest integer greater than 10 that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube is 64, we start by considering the given conditions. We know that \( n \) is a perfect square and a perfect cube, meaning there exist integers \( x \) and \( t \) such that \( n = x^2 \) and \( n = t^3 \). Given that \( n \geq 10 \), we need to find the smallest \( n \) that satisfies both conditions.
  First, we express \( n \) as \( t^3 \) and \( x^2 \). Since \( n \geq 10 \), we have:
  \[ t^3 \geq 10 \]
  \[ x^2 \geq 10 \]
  To satisfy both conditions, we need to find the smallest \( n \) that is a perfect square and a perfect cube, and greater than or equal to 10. We can test small values of \( t \) and \( x \) to find the smallest \( n \).
  Testing values:
  - For \( t = 4 \), \( n = 4^3 = 64 \)
  - For \( x = 4 \), \( n = 4^2 = 16 \)
  Since \( n \) must be a perfect square and a perfect cube, we check if \( n = 64 \) satisfies both conditions:
  - \( 64 = 4^3 \) (perfect cube)
  - \( 64 = 8^2 \) (perfect square)
  Thus, \( n = 64 \) is the smallest integer that satisfies all conditions.
