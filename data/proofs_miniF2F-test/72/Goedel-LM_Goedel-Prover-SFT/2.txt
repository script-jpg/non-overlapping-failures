  To show that the smallest integer greater than 10 that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube is 64, we proceed as follows:
  1. Let \( n \) be the smallest integer greater than 10 that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube.
  2. We know that \( n \) is a perfect square, so there exists an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 = n \).
  3. We also know that \( n \) is a perfect cube, so there exists an integer \( t \) such that \( t^3 = n \).
  4. We need to show that \( 64 \leq n \).
  5. By the properties of perfect squares and perfect cubes, \( n \) must be at least 64.
