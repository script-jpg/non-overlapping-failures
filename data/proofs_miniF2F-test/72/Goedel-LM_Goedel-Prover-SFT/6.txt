  To show that the smallest integer greater than 10 that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube is 64, we proceed as follows:
  1. Let \( n \) be a natural number such that \( 10 \leq n \).
  2. Assume there exists an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 = n \).
  3. Assume there exists an integer \( t \) such that \( t^3 = n \).
  4. Since \( x^2 = n \) and \( t^3 = n \), we can infer that \( x^2 = t^3 \).
  5. To satisfy \( x^2 = t^3 \) and \( 10 \leq n \), we need to find the smallest \( n \) that can be expressed as both a perfect square and a perfect cube.
  6. The smallest integer greater than 10 that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube is 64, as \( 64 = 8^2 \) and \( 64 = 4^3 \).
