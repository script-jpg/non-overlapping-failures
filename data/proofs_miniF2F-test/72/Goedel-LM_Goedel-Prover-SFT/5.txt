  To show that the smallest integer greater than 10 that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube is 64, we proceed as follows:
  1. Assume \( n \) is a smallest integer greater than 10 that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube.
  2. By the properties of perfect squares and perfect cubes, \( n \) must satisfy both \( n = x^2 \) for some integer \( x \) and \( n = t^3 \) for some integer \( t \).
  3. Since \( n > 10 \), we can infer that \( x \) and \( t \) must be sufficiently large to satisfy these conditions.
  4. We need to find the smallest \( n \) that satisfies both conditions and is greater than 10.
  5. By calculating the smallest perfect squares and cubes exceeding 10, we find that the smallest integer \( n \) that satisfies both conditions is 64.
