  To show that the smallest integer greater than 10 that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube is 64, we proceed as follows:
  1. Assume \( n \) is an integer such that \( 10 \leq n \).
  2. Given that \( n \) is a perfect square, there exists an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 = n \).
  3. Similarly, since \( n \) is a perfect cube, there exists an integer \( t \) such that \( t^3 = n \).
  4. We need to show that \( 64 \leq n \).
  5. By the properties of perfect squares and perfect cubes, we know that \( n \) must be a common multiple of the smallest perfect square (16) and the smallest perfect cube (8).
  6. Therefore, \( n \) must be a multiple of the least common multiple (LCM) of 16 and 8, which is 8.
  7. Since \( n \) is a perfect square and a perfect cube, it must be a power of 8.
  8. The smallest such \( n \) that satisfies these conditions is \( 8^3 = 512 \).
  9. However, since \( n \) must be greater than 10, the smallest valid \( n \) is \( 8^2 = 64 \).
  10. Thus, \( 64 \leq n \).
