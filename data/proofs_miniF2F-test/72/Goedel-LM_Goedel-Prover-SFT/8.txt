  To show that the smallest integer greater than 10 that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube is 64, we proceed as follows:
  1. Assume \( n \) is a natural number greater than 10 that is a perfect square and a perfect cube.
  2. By the properties of perfect squares and perfect cubes, \( n \) can be expressed as \( x^2 \) and \( t^3 \) for some integers \( x \) and \( t \).
  3. We need to find the smallest such \( n \) that satisfies both conditions.
  4. Given the constraints, we can start by checking the smallest possible values for \( x \) and \( t \) that satisfy \( x^2 = n \) and \( t^3 = n \).
  5. The smallest \( x \) and \( t \) that satisfy these conditions are \( x = 4 \) and \( t = 4 \), since \( 4^2 = 16 \) and \( 4^3 = 64 \).
  6. Therefore, the smallest integer \( n \) that is a perfect square and a perfect cube is \( 64 \).
