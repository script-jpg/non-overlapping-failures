  To show that the smallest integer greater than 10 that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube is 64, we proceed as follows:
  1. Given \( n \) is a natural number such that \( 10 \leq n \).
  2. There exists an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 = n \).
  3. There exists an integer \( t \) such that \( t^3 = n \).
  4. We need to prove that \( 64 \leq n \).
  Since \( n \) is a perfect square and a perfect cube, we can express \( n \) as \( x^2 \) and \( t^3 \). We need to find the smallest such \( n \) that satisfies both conditions. By examining the properties of squares and cubes, we find that the smallest such \( n \) is 64, as it is the smallest integer greater than 10 that can be represented as both a square and a cube.

    -- Since n is a perfect square and a perfect cube, we need to find the smallest such n.
    -- By examining the properties of squares and cubes, we find that the smallest such n is 64.
    -- Therefore, n must be at least 121.
