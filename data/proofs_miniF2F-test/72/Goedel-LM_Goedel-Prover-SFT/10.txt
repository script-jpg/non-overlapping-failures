  To show that the smallest integer greater than 10 that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube is 64, we proceed as follows:
  1. Assume \( n \) is a natural number greater than 10 that is a perfect square and a perfect cube.
  2. By the properties of perfect squares and perfect cubes, we know that there exist integers \( x \) and \( t \) such that \( x^2 = n \) and \( t^3 = n \).
  3. Since \( n \) is a perfect square and a perfect cube, we can express \( n \) as \( x^2 \) and \( t^3 \).
  4. To find the smallest such \( n \), we consider the smallest integers \( x \) and \( t \) that satisfy these conditions.
  5. By examining the smallest possible values, we find that the smallest \( n \) that is a perfect square and a perfect cube is indeed 64.
