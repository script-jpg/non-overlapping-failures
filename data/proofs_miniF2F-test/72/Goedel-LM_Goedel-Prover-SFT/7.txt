  To show that the smallest integer greater than 10 that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube is 64, we proceed as follows:
  1. Given \( n \) is a natural number such that \( 10 \leq n \).
  2. There exists a natural number \( x \) where \( x^2 = n \).
  3. There exists a natural number \( t \) where \( t^3 = n \).
  4. We need to prove that \( 64 \leq n \).
  From the given conditions, we can deduce:
  - \( n \) is a perfect square.
  - \( n \) is a perfect cube.
  To find the smallest such \( n \), we consider the smallest perfect squares and perfect cubes greater than 10. The smallest perfect squares are \( 12^2 = 144 \) and \( 13^2 = 169 \), and the smallest perfect cubes are \( 4^3 = 64 \) and \( 5^3 = 125 \). Among these, the smallest number that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube is 64.
  Thus, we conclude that \( 64 \leq n \).
