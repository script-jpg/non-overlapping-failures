  To show that the smallest integer greater than 10 that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube is 64, we need to prove that for any integer \( n \) satisfying the given conditions, \( n \) must be at least 64.
  1. **Perfect Square and Perfect Cube**: Given \( n \) is a perfect square and a perfect cube, we can express \( n \) as \( x^2 \) and \( t^3 \) for some integers \( x \) and \( t \).
  2. **Least Common Multiple**: Since \( n \) is both a perfect square and a perfect cube, it must be a multiple of the least common multiple (LCM) of 4 and 9, which is 36.
  3. **Verification**: We verify that 64 is indeed the smallest integer greater than 10 that satisfies the conditions.

    -- Since n is a perfect cube and greater than 10, the smallest possible value for n is 27 (which is 3^3).

    have : t < 6 := by nlinarith [pow_two x, pow_two (x - 1)]
    interval_cases t <;> nlinarith [pow_two x, pow_two (x - 1)]
  -- Combining the above inequalities, we find that n must be at least 64.
