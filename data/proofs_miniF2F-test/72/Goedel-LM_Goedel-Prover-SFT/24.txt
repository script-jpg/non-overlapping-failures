  To show that the smallest integer greater than 10 that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube is 64, we proceed as follows:
  1. Assume \( n \) is a natural number such that \( 10 \leq n \).
  2. Given that \( n \) is a perfect square, there exists an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 = n \).
  3. Similarly, given that \( n \) is a perfect cube, there exists an integer \( t \) such that \( t^3 = n \).
  4. We need to show that \( 64 \leq n \).
  To prove this, we use the properties of perfect squares and perfect cubes:
  - Since \( n \) is a perfect square, \( n \) can be written as \( x^2 \) for some integer \( x \).
  - Since \( n \) is a perfect cube, \( n \) can be written as \( t^3 \) for some integer \( t \).
  Given the constraints \( 10 \leq n \), we can test the smallest possible values for \( x \) and \( t \) to find the smallest \( n \) that satisfies both conditions.

  -- We need to show that 64 ≤ n. We will use the properties of perfect squares and perfect cubes.
  have : 64 ≤ x ^ 2 := by
    -- Since n is a perfect square and n ≥ 10, we need to find the smallest x such that x^2 ≥ 10.
    have : 10 ≤ t ^ 3 := by
      -- Similarly, since n is a perfect cube and n ≥ 10, we need to find the smallest t such that t^3 ≥ 10.

    -- We know that t^3 ≥ 10, so we can test the smallest possible values for t.

    -- If t < 10, then t^3 < 1000, which contradicts the condition t^3 ≥ 10.
    have : t < 10 := by linarith
    -- Solving the inequality t < 10, we get t ≤ 9.
    have : t ≤ 9 := by linarith
    -- We now check the values of t and verify that t^3 ≥ 10.

  -- Finally, we conclude that 64 ≤ n.
