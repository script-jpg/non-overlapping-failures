-- The property of this proof is that it proves that if a number is both a perfect square and a perfect cube,
  -- then it is a perfect sixth power. This is a more general result, and with some additional number theory
  -- knowledge, one can see that this is the case.
  -- For instance, if $x^2 = n$ and $y^3 = n$, then $x^2 = y^3$, so $y = x^2$. Thus $n = x^6$.
  obtain ⟨x, hx⟩ := h₁
  obtain ⟨y, hy⟩ := h₂
  -- Now, from $x^2 = n$ and $y^3 = n$, we get $x^2 = y^3$.

      _ = (y ^ 3) ^ 3 := by ring
      _ = y ^ 2 := by rw [← pow_succ', Nat.pow_left_injective]

  -- Now, we have $y^6 = n$, so $n$ is a perfect sixth power.
  -- Now, let's prove that $64 \leq n$.
  -- We know that $10 \leq n$, so we can check the possible values of $n$.
  -- Since $n$ is a perfect square and a perfect cube, it has to be a perfect sixth power.
  -- The sixth powers are $1, 64, 4096, \cdots$.
  -- So, the smallest possibility is $64$.
