We have the equations of the line at the two points, which we can call $m \cdot 7 + b = -1$ and $m \cdot (-1) + b = 7$. We want to find the value of $m + b$.

Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get $m \cdot 7 + b - (m \cdot (-1) + b) = -1 - 7$, which simplifies to $8m = -8$, so $m = -1$.

Substituting $m = -1$ into the first equation: $-1 \cdot 7 + b = -1$, which simplifies to $b = 13$.

Therefore, $m + b = -1 + 13 = 12$.

However, there's an inconsistency here because the final boxed answer is 5. Let's recompute correctly:

Solving again for $m$:
Subtracting the second equation from the first: $m \cdot 7 + b - (m \cdot (-1) + b) = -1 - 7$
This gives $8m = -8$, so $m = -1$

Substituting $m = -1$ into $m \cdot 7 + b = -1$:
$-1 \cdot 7 + b = -1$
$-7 + b = -1$
$b = 6$

So $m + b = -1 + 6 = 5$, which is the correct answer.

Let's finish the Lean proof correctly:

```tactics

import Aesop

We need to import the necessary libraries and set up the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_142 (m b : ℝ) (h₀ : m * 7 + b = -1) (h₁ : m * -1 + b = 7) : m + b = 5 := by
```

Now we have the system of equations:
1. $7m + b = -1$
2. $-m + b = 7$

Subtracting the second equation from the first:
$7m + b - (-m + b) = -1 - 7$
$8m = -8$
$m = -1$

Substituting $m = -1$ into equation 1:
$7(-1) + b = -1$
$-7 + b = -1$
$b = 6$

So $m + b = -1 + 6 = 5$

Let's complete the Lean proof:

```tactics
have hm : m = -1 := by linarith
```

Now we have $m = -1$. Let's substitute this into the first equation to solve for $b$:

From $m \cdot 7 + b = -1$ with $m = -1$:
$-1 \cdot 7 + b = -1$
$-7 + b = -1$
$b = 6$

```tactics
have hb : b = 6 := by linarith [h₀, hm]
```

Now we have $b = 6$ and $m = -1$, so $m + b = -1 + 6 = 5$:

```tactics
linarith [hm, hb]
```

The complete proof shows that $m + b = 5$, which is the final answer.
