The solution starts by determining the slope $m$ of the line passing through the two given points $B(7,-1)$ and $C(-1,7)$. The formula for the slope $m$ between two points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ is $m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$. Substituting the given points, we have $m = \frac{7 - (-1)}{-1 - 7} = \frac{8}{-8} = -1$.

However, upon re-evaluation, the correct calculation should be $m = \frac{7 - (-1)}{-1 - 7} = \frac{8}{-8} = -1$. The slope is actually $-1$, not $-2$ as initially stated.

Now, using the point-slope form of the line equation $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$ with point $B(7,-1)$, we have $y + 1 = -1(x - 7)$. Simplifying, we get $y = -x + 7 - 1$, or $y = -x + 6$. Thus $m = -1$ and $b = 6$.

Therefore $m + b = -1 + 6 = 5$.

The Lean proof should be corrected as follows:

The theorem statement is correct. We have a line passing through points $B(7,-1)$ and $C(-1,7)$ with equation $y = mx + b$, and we need to prove that $m + b = 5$.

Let's start by determining the slope $m$ using the formula for slope between two points: $m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{7 - (-1)}{-1 - 7} = \frac{8}{-8} = -1$.

Now, using point $B(7,-1)$ in the equation $y = mx + b$:
$-1 = -1 \cdot 7 + b \Rightarrow -1 = -7 + b \Rightarrow b = 6$

So $m + b = -1 + 6 = 5$.

The Lean proof should reflect this:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_142 (m b : ℝ) (h₀ : m * 7 + b = -1) (h₁ : m * -1 + b = 7) : m + b = 5 := by
```

We have two equations:
1. $7m + b = -1$ (from point $B(7,-1)$)
2. $-m + b = 7$ (from point $C(-1,7)$)

Subtracting the second equation from the first:
$7m + b - (-m + b) = -1 - 7$
$8m = -8$
$m = -1$

Substituting $m = -1$ into $-m + b = 7$:
$-(-1) + b = 7$
$1 + b = 7$
$b = 6$

So $m + b = -1 + 6 = 5$.

Let's complete the Lean proof:

```tactics
have hm : m = -1 := by
  linarith
```

We've determined that $m = -1$. Now we need to find $b$ using one of the original equations. Using $m * -1 + b = 7$:

```tactics
have hb : b = 6 := by
  rw [hm] at h₁
  linarith
```

Now that we have $m = -1$ and $b = 6$, we can compute $m + b$:

```tactics
rw [hm, hb]
norm_num
```

The final answer is indeed $5$.
