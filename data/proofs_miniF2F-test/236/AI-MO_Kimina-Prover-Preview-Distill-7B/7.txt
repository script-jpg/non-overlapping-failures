-- Solve for $m$ by subtracting the two equations.
  have hm : m = -2 := by
    linarith

  -- Solve for $b$ using the value of $m$.
  have hb : b = 13 := by
    rw [hm] at h₀
    linarith

  -- Show that $m+b=5$.
  rw [hm, hb]
  linarith
```

This completes the formal proof. The key steps were:
1. Subtracting the two equations to solve for $m$
2. Using the value of $m$ to solve for $b$
3. Showing that $m+b=5$

The final answer is indeed $\boxed{5}$.
