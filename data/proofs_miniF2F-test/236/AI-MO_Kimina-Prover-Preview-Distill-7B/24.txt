/- Solve the system of equations to find $m$ and $b$.

  From $7m + b = -1$ and $-m + b = 7$, we subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate $b$:

  $7m + b - (-m + b) = -1 - 7$

  $8m = -8$

  $m = -1$

  Substituting $m = -1$ into $7m + b = -1$:

  $7(-1) + b = -1$

  $-7 + b = -1$

  $b = 6$

  Therefore, $m + b = -1 + 6 = 5$. -/
