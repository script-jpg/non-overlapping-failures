The final answer is 11, but the boxed answer is 5. There must be an error in my calculations. Let me recalculate.

The slope $m$ is calculated as $\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{7 - (-1)}{-1 - 7} = \frac{8}{-8} = -1$.

Substituting point $B(7,-1)$ into $y = mx + b$:
$-1 = -1 \cdot 7 + b \Rightarrow -1 = -7 + b \Rightarrow b = 6$

Therefore $m + b = -1 + 6 = 5$, which is the boxed answer.

Let me correct the Lean code:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

Now I'll define the theorem with the given conditions:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_142 (m b : ℝ) (h₀ : m * 7 + b = -1) (h₁ : m * -1 + b = 7) : m + b = 5 := by
```

I need to solve this system of equations to find $m + b$. Let's calculate $m$ first by subtracting the second equation from the first:

```tactics
have hm : m = -1 := by
  linarith
```

Now that we have $m = -1$, let's substitute it back into the first equation to solve for $b$:

```tactics
have hb : b = 6 := by
  rw [hm] at h₀
  linarith
```

With $m = -1$ and $b = 6$, we find that $m + b = -1 + 6 = 5$:

```tactics
calc
  m + b = -1 + 6 := by rw [hm, hb]
  _ = 5 := by norm_num
```

The Lean proof is now complete. The key insight was correctly calculating the slope $m$ as $-1$ by subtracting the second equation from the first. This led to finding $b = 6$, and therefore $m + b = 5$.
