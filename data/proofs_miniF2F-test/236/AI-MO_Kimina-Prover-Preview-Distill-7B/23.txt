# Solving the Line Equation Problem in Lean 4

I'll work through finding $m + b$ for the line passing through points $B(7, -1)$ and $C(-1, 7)$.

First, let's think about how to find the equation of the line. Given two points, we can compute the slope $m$ using the formula:
\[ m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \]

For our points $B(7, -1)$ and $C(-1, 7)$:
\[ m = \frac{7 - (-1)}{-1 - 7} = \frac{7 + 1}{-1 - 7} = \frac{8}{-8} = -1 \]

Wait, let me compute that again carefully:
\[ m = \frac{7 - (-1)}{-1 - 7} = \frac{8}{-8} = -1 \]

Yes, that's correct. The slope $m$ is $-1$.

Now, using point-slope form $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$ with point $B(7, -1)$:
\[ y + 1 = -1(x - 7) \]
\[ y + 1 = -x + 7 \]
\[ y = -x + 7 - 1 \]
\[ y = -x + 6 \]

So $m = -1$ and $b = 6$. Then $m + b = -1 + 6 = 5$.

Wait, let's verify using the other point $C(-1, 7)$:
\[ y = -(-1) + 6 = 1 + 6 = 7 \]
Correct, so that's consistent.

Therefore, $m + b = -1 + 6 = 5$ is indeed the answer.

Now, let's formalize this in Lean 4:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

```

We're importing the necessary libraries and setting up the environment. The `maxHeartbeats 0` allows for more computation time if needed, though for a simple algebra problem like this, it's unlikely to need.

Now, let's define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_142 (m b : ℝ) (h₀ : m * 7 + b = -1) (h₁ : m * -1 + b = 7) : m + b = 5 := by
```

We have two equations from the line passing through the given points:
- From $B(7, -1)$: $7m + b = -1$
- From $C(-1, 7)$: $-m + b = 7$

To find $m$ and $b$, we can solve these equations simultaneously. Subtracting the second equation from the first:
\[ (7m + b) - (-m + b) = -1 - 7 \]
\[ 7m + b + m - b = -8 \]
\[ 8m = -8 \]
\[ m = -1 \]

Now substituting $m = -1$ into the first equation:
\[ 7(-1) + b = -1 \]
\[ -7 + b = -1 \]
\[ b = 6 \]

So $m + b = -1 + 6 = 5$.

Let's complete the Lean proof:

```tactics
have : m = -1 := by linarith
have : b = 6 := by linarith
linarith
```

In the Lean code, we directly computed $m = -1$ by subtracting the two equations, then substituted back to find $b = 6$, and finally computed $m + b = -1 + 6 = 5$ using linear arithmetic.

The Lean solution is elegant and concise because Lean's `linarith` tactic is powerful for solving linear arithmetic goals. It can automatically handle the algebraic manipulations we did manually above.

Therefore, the answer is indeed $\boxed{5}$.
