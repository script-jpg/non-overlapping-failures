The problem is to find the value of $m + b$ for the line passing through the points $B(7, -1)$ and $C(-1, 7)$, where $y = mx + b$ is the equation of the line.

First, we need to find the slope $m$ of the line. The formula for the slope $m$ given two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is:
\[ m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \]

Substituting the given points $B(7, -1)$ and $C(-1, 7)$:
\[ m = \frac{7 - (-1)}{-1 - 7} = \frac{7 + 1}{-1 - 7} = \frac{8}{-8} = -1 \]

Now that we have $m = -1$, we can use one of the points to find $b$ (the y-intercept). Using point $B(7, -1)$:
\[ -1 = (-1) \cdot 7 + b \]
\[ -1 = -7 + b \]
\[ b = -1 + 7 = 6 \]

So $m = -1$ and $b = 6$. Therefore:
\[ m + b = -1 + 6 = 5 \]

To verify, we can check if this line equation satisfies both points:
- For $B(7, -1)$: $y = -1 \cdot 7 + 6 = -7 + 6 = -1$ ✓
- For $C(-1, 7)$: $y = -1 \cdot (-1) + 6 = 1 + 6 = 7$ ✓

The Lean proof is elegant and concise. It takes as hypotheses the equations of the line at the two given points, then uses linear arithmetic to solve for $m + b$ directly.

The theorem is stating that given the line passes through $B(7, -1)$ and $C(-1, 7)$, we have $m + b = 5$. The Lean proof directly uses the linarith tactic to solve the system of equations given by the two points.

The Lean approach is more abstract than the manual calculation, but it's doing the same thing: solving the system of equations to find $m + b$. The Lean proof is more direct because it's working with the equations directly without explicitly solving for $m$ and $b$ separately.

In conclusion, we've shown that $m + b = 5$ for the line passing through the given points, both through manual computation and formal Lean proof.
