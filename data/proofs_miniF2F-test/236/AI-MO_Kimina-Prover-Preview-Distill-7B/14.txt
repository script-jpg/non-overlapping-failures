```

The final answer is $ \boxed{5} $

The informal solution provided is incorrect. Let's recompute the equation of the line passing through points $B(7,-1)$ and $C(-1,7)$.

First, we calculate the slope $m$:
\[ m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{7 - (-1)}{-1 - 7} = \frac{8}{-8} = -1 \]

Now, using the point-slope form $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$ with point $B(7,-1)$:
\[ y + 1 = -1(x - 7) \]
\[ y + 1 = -x + 7 \]
\[ y = -x + 7 - 1 \]
\[ y = -x + 6 \]

So $m = -1$ and $b = 6$. Therefore $m + b = -1 + 6 = 5$.

The Lean proof should reflect this:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

We have the theorem statement with the conditions that the line passes through points $B(7,-1)$ and $C(-1,7)$:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_142 (m b : ℝ) (h₀ : m * 7 + b = -1) (h₁ : m * -1 + b = 7) : m + b = 5 := by
```

Now we need to solve the system of equations to find $m$ and $b$:

Subtracting the two equations:
\[ m \cdot 7 + b - (m \cdot (-1) + b) = -1 - 7 \]
\[ 7m + b + m - b = -8 \]
\[ 8m = -8 \]
\[ m = -1 \]

Substituting $m = -1$ in the first equation:
\[ -1 \cdot 7 + b = -1 \]
\[ -7 + b = -1 \]
\[ b = 6 \]

So $m + b = -1 + 6 = 5$.

Let's complete the Lean proof:

```tactics
have hm : m = -1 := by
  linarith
```

Now, substituting $m = -1$ in the first equation to find $b$:

```tactics
have hb : b = 6 := by
  rw [hm] at h₀
  linarith
```

Finally, computing $m + b$:

```tactics
rw [hm, hb]
norm_num
```

So the Lean proof is correct, and the boxed answer is indeed 5.
