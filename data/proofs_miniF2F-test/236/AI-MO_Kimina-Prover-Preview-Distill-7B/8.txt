This Lean proof will solve the system of equations to find the values of $m$ and $b$ for the line passing through the points $B(7,-1)$ and $C(-1,7)$. 

First, let's understand the problem: We have a line passing through two points, and we need to find the sum $m + b$ where $y = mx + b$ is the equation of the line.

The Lean code starts by importing the necessary libraries and setting up the theorem:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

Now, let's define the theorem statement. We're given a line with slope $m$ and y-intercept $b$ passing through points $B(7,-1)$ and $C(-1,7)$. This gives us two equations:
1. At point B: $m \cdot 7 + b = -1$
2. At point C: $m \cdot (-1) + b = 7$

We need to prove that $m + b = 5$.

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_142 (m b : ℝ) (h₀ : m * 7 + b = -1) (h₁ : m * -1 + b = 7) : m + b = 5 := by
```

The theorem states that if $m$ and $b$ satisfy both equations (representing the line passing through both points), then $m + b = 5$.

Let's solve this algebraically to verify our approach:
- From the two equations:
  1. $7m + b = -1$
  2. $-m + b = 7$

- Subtracting the second from the first: $7m + b - (-m + b) = -1 - 7$
  $7m + b + m - b = -8$
  $8m = -8$
  $m = -1$

- Substituting $m = -1$ in the first equation: $7(-1) + b = -1$
  $-7 + b = -1$
  $b = 6$

- Therefore $m + b = -1 + 6 = 5$

Now, let's complete the Lean proof:

```tactics
have h₂ : m = -1 := by
  linarith
```

The Lean tactic `linarith` is powerful for solving linear arithmetic problems. Here, it's analyzing the constraints from both equations to deduce that $m = -1$. This matches our algebraic solution.

Now, we substitute $m = -1$ into one of the original equations to find $b$:

```tactics
have h₃ : b = 6 := by
  linarith [h₀, h₂]
```

Again, `linarith` is working with the first equation (h₀) and the newly deduced value of $m$ (h₂) to solve for $b = 6$. This is consistent with our algebraic solution.

Finally, we can compute $m + b$:

```tactics
linarith [h₂, h₃]
```

The `linarith` tactic is using the facts $m = -1$ and $b = 6$ to conclude that $m + b = 5$, which is exactly what we wanted to prove.

Therefore, the final answer is indeed 5.
