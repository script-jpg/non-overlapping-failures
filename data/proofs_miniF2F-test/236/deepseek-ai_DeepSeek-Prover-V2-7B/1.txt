  To find the equation of the line through the points \( B(7, -1) \) and \( C(-1, 7) \), we first determine the slope \( m \):
  
  \[ m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{7 - (-1)}{-1 - 7} = \frac{8}{-8} = -1 \]
  
  Next, we use the point-slope form of the line to find the y-intercept \( b \):
  
  \[ y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \]
  \[ y - (-1) = -1(x - 7) \]
  \[ y + 1 = -x + 7 \]
  \[ y = -x + 6 \]
  
  Thus, the slope-intercept form of the line is \( y = -x + 6 \). The sum \( m + b \) is then:
  
  \[ m + b = -1 + 6 = 5 \]
