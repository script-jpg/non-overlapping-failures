  Given a line \(\ell\) passing through the points \(B(7, -1)\) and \(C(-1, 7)\), we need to find the equation of this line in the form \(y = mx + b\) and then compute \(m + b\). We are given the conditions:
  1. \(m \cdot 7 + b = -1\)
  2. \(m \cdot (-1) + b = 7\)
  First, we solve for \(m\) by subtracting the second equation from the first:
  \[
  (m \cdot 7 + b) - (m \cdot (-1) + b) = -1 - 7
  \]
  Simplifying this, we get:
  \[
  m \cdot 7 + b + m \cdot 1 + b = -8
  \]
  \[
  m \cdot 8 + 2b = -8
  \]
  \[
  m \cdot 8 + 2b = -8
  \]
  \[
  m \cdot 8 = -8 - 2b
  \]
  \[
  m = -\frac{8 + 2b}{8}
  \]
  Next, we substitute \(m\) back into one of the original equations to solve for \(b\). Using the first equation:
  \[
  m \cdot 7 + b = -1
  \]
  \[
  \left(-\frac{8 + 2b}{8}\right) \cdot 7 + b = -1
  \]
  \[
  -\frac{56 + 14b}{8} + b = -1
  \]
  \[
  -7 - \frac{14b}{8} + b = -1
  \]
  \[
  -7 - \frac{7b}{4} + b = -1
  \]
  \[
  -7 - \frac{7b}{4} + \frac{4b}{4} = -1
  \]
  \[
  -7 - \frac{3b}{4} = -1
  \]
  \[
  -7 + 1 = \frac{3b}{4}
  \]
  \[
  -6 = \frac{3b}{4}
  \]
  \[
  b = -8
  \]
  Now, substituting \(b = -8\) back into the expression for \(m\):
  \[
  m = -\frac{8 + 2(-8)}{8}
  \]
  \[
  m = -\frac{8 - 16}{8}
  \]
  \[
  m = -\frac{-8}{8}
  \]
  \[
  m = 1
  \]
  Finally, we compute \(m + b\):
  \[
  m + b = 1 + (-8)
  \]
  \[
  m + b = -7
  \]
  However, this result does not match the expected \(m + b = 5\). Let's re-evaluate the steps to ensure correctness.
