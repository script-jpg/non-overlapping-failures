  Given a line \(\ell\) that passes through the points \(B(7, -1)\) and \(C(-1, 7)\), we need to compute the equation of this line in the form \(y = mx + b\) and then determine \(m + b\).
  1. From the points \(B(7, -1)\) and \(C(-1, 7)\), we derive the equations:
     \[
     m \cdot 7 + b = -1 \quad \text{(1)}
     \]
     \[
     m \cdot -1 + b = 7 \quad \text{(2)}
     \]
  2. We solve these equations simultaneously to find \(m\) and \(b\).
  3. Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1):
     \[
     (m \cdot 7 + b) - (m \cdot -1 + b) = -1 - 7
     \]
     \[
     7m + b + m + b = -8
     \]
     \[
     8m + 2b = -8
     \]
     \[
     4m + b = -4
     \]
  4. Solving for \(b\):
     \[
     b = -4 - 4m
     \]
  5. Substituting \(b = -4 - 4m\) back into equation (1):
     \[
     m \cdot 7 + (-4 - 4m) = -1
     \]
     \[
     7m - 4 - 4m = -1
     \]
     \[
     3m - 4 = -1
     \]
     \[
     3m = 3
     \]
     \[
     m = 1
     \]
  6. Substituting \(m = 1\) back into \(b = -4 - 4m\):
     \[
     b = -4 - 4 \cdot 1
     \]
     \[
     b = -8
     \]
  7. Finally, we calculate \(m + b\):
     \[
     m + b = 1 + (-8) = -7
     \]
