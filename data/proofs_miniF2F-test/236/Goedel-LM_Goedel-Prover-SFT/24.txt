  Given a line \(\ell\) that passes through the points \(B(7, -1)\) and \(C(-1, 7)\), we need to find the equation of this line in the form \(y = mx + b\) and compute \(m + b\). We are given the equations:
  1. \(7m + b = -1\)
  2. \(-m + b = 7\)
  To find \(m\) and \(b\), we solve these equations simultaneously. First, solve the second equation for \(b\):
  \[ b = 7 + m \]
  Substitute \(b = 7 + m\) into the first equation:
  \[ 7m + (7 + m) = -1 \]
  \[ 7m + 7 + m = -1 \]
  \[ 8m + 7 = -1 \]
  \[ 8m = -8 \]
  \[ m = -1 \]
  Substitute \(m = -1\) back into \(b = 7 + m\):
  \[ b = 7 + (-1) \]
  \[ b = 6 \]
  Thus, the values are \(m = -1\) and \(b = 6\). Finally, compute \(m + b\):
  \[ m + b = -1 + 6 = 5 \]
