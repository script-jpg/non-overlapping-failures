  Given a line \(\ell\) that passes through the points \(B(7, -1)\) and \(C(-1, 7)\), we need to compute \(m + b\) where \(m\) is the slope and \(b\) is the y-intercept of the line. The equation of the line can be written in the form \(y = mx + b\). We are given the equations:
  1. \(7m + b = -1\)
  2. \(-m + b = 7\)
  To find \(m + b\), we solve these equations simultaneously. First, we isolate \(b\) from the first equation:
  \[ b = -1 - 7m \]
  Next, substitute \(b\) into the second equation:
  \[ -m + (-1 - 7m) = 7 \]
  Simplify and solve for \(m\):
  \[ -m - 1 - 7m = 7 \]
  \[ -8m - 1 = 7 \]
  \[ -8m = 8 \]
  \[ m = -1 \]
  Now substitute \(m = -1\) back into the expression for \(b\):
  \[ b = -1 - 7(-1) \]
  \[ b = -1 + 7 \]
  \[ b = 6 \]
  Finally, compute \(m + b\):
  \[ m + b = -1 + 6 = 5 \]
  Thus, the value of \(m + b\) is \(5\).
