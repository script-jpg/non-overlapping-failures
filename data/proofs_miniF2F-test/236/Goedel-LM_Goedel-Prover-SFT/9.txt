  To solve the problem, we start by using the given points \( B(7, -1) \) and \( C(-1, 7) \) to determine the equation of the line passing through these points. The equation of the line can be written in the form \( y = mx + b \), where \( m \) is the slope and \( b \) is the y-intercept.
  Given the points, we can set up the following system of equations:
  1. \( 7m + b = -1 \)
  2. \( -m + b = 7 \)
  First, we solve for \( m \) by isolating it in the second equation:
  \[ -m + b = 7 \]
  \[ b = m + 7 \]
  Next, substitute \( b = m + 7 \) into the first equation:
  \[ 7m + (m + 7) = -1 \]
  \[ 7m + m + 7 = -1 \]
  \[ 8m + 7 = -1 \]
  \[ 8m = -8 \]
  \[ m = -1 \]
  Now, substitute \( m = -1 \) back into the equation \( b = m + 7 \):
  \[ b = -1 + 7 \]
  \[ b = 6 \]
  Finally, we calculate \( m + b \):
  \[ m + b = -1 + 6 \]
  \[ m + b = 5 \]
