  To solve the problem, we start by noting the points \( B(7, -1) \) and \( C(-1, 7) \). The equation of the line passing through these points can be written in the form \( y = mx + b \). We need to compute \( m + b \) and show that it equals 5.
  Given the points, we can set up the following equations:
  1. \( -1 = 7m + b \)
  2. \( 7 = -m + b \)
  We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of \( m \) and \( b \).
  First, solve for \( m \) using the first equation:
  \[ -1 = 7m + b \]
  Next, solve for \( m \) using the second equation:
  \[ 7 = -m + b \]
  Now, we have two equations:
  1. \( -1 = 7m + b \)
  2. \( 7 = -m + b \)
  Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( b \):
  \[ (7 = -m + b) - (-1 = 7m + b) \]
  \[ 7 + 1 = -m - 7m \]
  \[ 8 = -8m \]
  \[ m = -1 \]
  Substitute \( m = -1 \) back into the first equation to find \( b \):
  \[ -1 = 7(-1) + b \]
  \[ -1 = -7 + b \]
  \[ b = 6 \]
  Finally, compute \( m + b \):
  \[ m + b = -1 + 6 = 5 \]
  Thus, the value of \( m + b \) is indeed 5.
