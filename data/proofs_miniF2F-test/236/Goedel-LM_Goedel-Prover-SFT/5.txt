  Given the points \( B(7, -1) \) and \( C(-1, 7) \), we need to find the equation of the line passing through these points in the form \( y = mx + b \) and then compute \( m + b \).
  1. Substitute the points \( B(7, -1) \) and \( C(-1, 7) \) into the line equation \( y = mx + b \):
     - For point \( B \): \( -1 = 7m + b \)
     - For point \( C \): \( 7 = -m + b \)
  2. We now have the system of linear equations:
     \[
     \begin{cases}
     -1 = 7m + b \\
     7 = -m + b
     \end{cases}
     \]
  3. Add the two equations to eliminate \( b \):
     \[
     (-1) + 7 = (7m + b) + (-m + b) \implies 6 = 6m + 2b \implies 3 = 3m + b
     \]
  4. Solve for \( b \) in terms of \( m \):
     \[
     b = 3 - 3m
     \]
  5. Substitute \( b = 3 - 3m \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( m \):
     \[
     -1 = 7m + (3 - 3m) \implies -1 = 7m + 3 - 3m \implies -1 = 4m + 3 \implies 4m = -4 \implies m = -1
     \]
  6. Substitute \( m = -1 \) back into \( b = 3 - 3m \):
     \[
     b = 3 - 3(-1) \implies b = 3 + 3 \implies b = 6
     \]
  7. Finally, compute \( m + b \):
     \[
     m + b = -1 + 6 = 5
     \]
