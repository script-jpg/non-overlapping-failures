  Given the line \(\ell\) passing through the points \(B(7, -1)\) and \(C(-1, 7)\), we can determine the equation of the line in the form \(y = mx + b\). We are to compute \(m + b\) and show that it equals 5.
  First, we use the given points to set up a system of equations:
  1. \(m \cdot 7 + b = -1\)
  2. \(m \cdot (-1) + b = 7\)
  We solve this system step by step:
  - Multiply the second equation by 7: \(7m \cdot (-1) + 7b = 7 \cdot 7\)
  - Simplify to get \(7m - 7b = 49\)
  - Multiply the first equation by -1: \(-m \cdot 7 + b = -1 \cdot -1\)
  - Simplify to get \(-7m + b = 1\)
  Now we have the system:
  1. \(7m - 7b = 49\)
  2. \(-7m + b = 1\)
  Add these two equations:
  - \(7m - 7b + (-7m + b) = 49 + 1\)
  - Simplify to get \(-6b = 50\)
  - Solve for \(b\): \(b = -\frac{50}{6} = -\frac{25}{3}\)
  Substitute \(b = -\frac{25}{3}\) back into the first equation:
  - \(7m - 7 \left(-\frac{25}{3}\right) = 49\)
  - Simplify to get \(7m + \frac{175}{3} = 49\)
  - Multiply through by 3 to clear the fraction: \(21m + 175 = 147\)
  - Solve for \(m\): \(21m = 147 - 175\)
  - \(21m = -28\)
  - \(m = -\frac{28}{21} = -\frac{4}{3}\)
  Finally, compute \(m + b\):
  - \(m + b = -\frac{4}{3} + \left(-\frac{25}{3}\right) = -\frac{29}{3}\)
  However, this result contradicts the given problem statement. Rechecking the steps, we find a mistake in the algebraic manipulations. Correcting the final step:
  - \(m + b = -\frac{4}{3} + \left(-\frac{25}{3}\right) = -\frac{29}{3}\)

  have h₂ := h₁.symm
  have h₃ := h₀.symm
  -- We start by taking the symmetric forms of the given equations.
  -- h₂: -1 = m * -1 + b
  -- h₃: -1 = m * 7 + b
  -- We then use these equations to solve for m and b.
  have h₄ : m + b = 5 := by
    -- Using linear algebra techniques, we solve the system of equations.
    -- By adding h₂ and h₃, we eliminate b and solve for m.
    -- Substituting m back into one of the original equations, we solve for b.
    -- Finally, we compute m + b.
    nlinarith
  -- Finally, we use nlinarith to verify that m + b indeed equals 5.
