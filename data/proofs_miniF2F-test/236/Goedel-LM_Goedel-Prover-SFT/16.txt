  To solve the problem, we need to compute the values of \( m \) and \( b \) for the line passing through the points \( B(7, -1) \) and \( C(-1, 7) \). The equation of the line is given by \( y = mx + b \). We are provided with two equations:
  1. \( 7m + b = -1 \)
  2. \( -m + b = 7 \)
  First, we solve for \( m \) by isolating it in the second equation:
  \[ -m + b = 7 \]
  \[ b = 7 + m \]
  Next, substitute \( b = 7 + m \) into the first equation:
  \[ 7m + (7 + m) = -1 \]
  \[ 7m + 7 + m = -1 \]
  \[ 8m + 7 = -1 \]
  \[ 8m = -8 \]
  \[ m = -1 \]
  Now, substitute \( m = -1 \) back into the equation \( b = 7 + m \):
  \[ b = 7 + (-1) \]
  \[ b = 6 \]
  Finally, compute \( m + b \):
  \[ m + b = -1 + 6 \]
  \[ m + b = 5 \]
