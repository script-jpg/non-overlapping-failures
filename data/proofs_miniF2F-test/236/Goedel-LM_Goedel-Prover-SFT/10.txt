  Given the points \( B(7, -1) \) and \( C(-1, 7) \), we need to find the equation of the line passing through these points in the form \( y = mx + b \). We are given the equations \( m \cdot 7 + b = -1 \) and \( m \cdot -1 + b = 7 \). We need to show that \( m + b = 5 \).
  First, we solve the system of linear equations:
  1. \( 7m + b = -1 \)
  2. \( -m + b = 7 \)
  By adding these two equations, we eliminate \( b \):
  \[ (7m + b) + (-m + b) = -1 + 7 \]
  \[ 6m + 2b = 6 \]
  \[ 3m + b = 3 \]
  Next, we substitute \( b = 3 - 3m \) into the first equation:
  \[ 7m + (3 - 3m) = -1 \]
  \[ 7m + 3 - 3m = -1 \]
  \[ 4m + 3 = -1 \]
  \[ 4m = -4 \]
  \[ m = -1 \]
  Substituting \( m = -1 \) back into \( b = 3 - 3m \):
  \[ b = 3 - 3(-1) \]
  \[ b = 3 + 3 \]
  \[ b = 6 \]
  Finally, we calculate \( m + b \):
  \[ m + b = -1 + 6 = 5 \]
