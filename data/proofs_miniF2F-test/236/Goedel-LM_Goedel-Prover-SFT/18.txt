  Given the line \(\ell\) passing through the points \(B(7, -1)\) and \(C(-1, 7)\), we can express the equation of the line in the form \(y = mx + b\). We need to compute \(m + b\) and show that it equals 5.
  First, we use the given points to form two equations:
  1. \(7m + b = -1\)
  2. \(-m + b = 7\)
  We solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of \(m\) and \(b\).
  From the second equation, we can express \(b\) in terms of \(m\):
  \[ b = m + 7 \]
  Substitute \(b = m + 7\) into the first equation:
  \[ 7m + (m + 7) = -1 \]
  \[ 8m + 7 = -1 \]
  \[ 8m = -8 \]
  \[ m = -1 \]
  Now substitute \(m = -1\) back into \(b = m + 7\):
  \[ b = -1 + 7 \]
  \[ b = 6 \]
  Finally, we compute \(m + b\):
  \[ m + b = -1 + 6 = 5 \]
  Thus, the sum \(m + b\) is indeed 5.
