  Given a line \(\ell\) that passes through the points \(B(7, -1)\) and \(C(-1, 7)\), we need to compute the equation of this line in the form \(y = mx + b\). We are given the equations \(m \cdot 7 + b = -1\) and \(m \cdot -1 + b = 7\). We need to show that \(m + b = 5\).
  First, we solve for \(m\) using the two given equations. By subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:
  \[
  (m \cdot 7 + b) - (m \cdot -1 + b) = -1 - 7
  \]
  Simplifying this, we obtain:
  \[
  8m = -8 \implies m = -1
  \]
  Next, we substitute \(m = -1\) back into one of the original equations to solve for \(b\). Using \(m \cdot 7 + b = -1\), we get:
  \[
  -7 + b = -1 \implies b = 6
  \]
  Finally, we compute \(m + b\):
  \[
  m + b = -1 + 6 = 5
  \]
  Thus, the sum \(m + b\) is indeed 5.
