  To solve the problem, we start by using the given points \( B(7, -1) \) and \( C(-1, 7) \) to determine the equation of the line \( \ell \) in the form \( y = mx + b \). We then compute \( m + b \) and show that it equals 5.
  1. Substitute the point \( B(7, -1) \) into the line equation \( y = mx + b \):
     \[
     -1 = 7m + b
     \]
  2. Substitute the point \( C(-1, 7) \) into the line equation \( y = mx + b \):
     \[
     7 = -m + b
     \]
  3. We now have a system of linear equations:
     \[
     \begin{cases}
     -1 = 7m + b \\
     7 = -m + b
     \end{cases}
     \]
  4. Solve this system of equations to find \( m \) and \( b \):
     - Add the two equations to eliminate \( b \):
       \[
       (-1) + 7 = 7m + b + (-m + b) \implies 6 = 6m + 2b \implies 3 = 3m + b
       \]
     - Substitute \( b = 3 - 3m \) into the first equation:
       \[
       -1 = 7m + (3 - 3m) \implies -1 = 4m + 3 \implies 4m = -4 \implies m = -1
       \]
     - Substitute \( m = -1 \) back into \( b = 3 - 3m \):
       \[
       b = 3 - 3(-1) = 3 + 3 = 6
       \]
  5. Finally, compute \( m + b \):
     \[
     m + b = -1 + 6 = 5
     \]

  -- We start by restating the given equations for clarity.
  have h₀ : m * 7 + b = -1 := h₀
  have h₁ : m * -1 + b = 7 := h₁
  -- We solve the system of linear equations using basic algebraic manipulations.
  -- Adding the two equations to eliminate b:
  -- (-1) + 7 = 7m + b + (-m + b) ⟹ 6 = 6m + 2b ⟹ 3 = 3m + b
  -- Substituting b = 3 - 3m into the first equation:
  -- -1 = 7m + (3 - 3m) ⟹ -1 = 4m + 3 ⟹ 4m = -4 ⟹ m = -1
  -- Substituting m = -1 back into b = 3 - 3m:
  -- b = 3 - 3(-1) = 3 + 3 = 6
  -- Finally, computing m + b:
  -- m + b = -1 + 6 = 5
