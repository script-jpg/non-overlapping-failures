  To solve the problem, we start by determining the slope \( m \) and the y-intercept \( b \) of the line passing through the points \( B(7, -1) \) and \( C(-1, 7) \). The equation of the line is given by \( y = mx + b \). We are provided with the following equations:
  1. \( m \cdot 7 + b = -1 \)
  2. \( m \cdot (-1) + b = 7 \)
  First, we solve for \( m \) by isolating \( m \) in both equations. Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:
  \[ (m \cdot 7 + b) - (m \cdot (-1) + b) = -1 - 7 \]
  \[ 7m - m + b + b = -8 \]
  \[ 6m + 2b = -8 \]
  \[ 3m + b = -4 \]
  Next, we solve for \( b \) by isolating \( b \):
  \[ b = -4 - 3m \]
  Substituting \( b = -4 - 3m \) back into one of the original equations:
  \[ m \cdot 7 + (-4 - 3m) = -1 \]
  \[ 7m - 4 - 3m = -1 \]
  \[ 4m - 4 = -1 \]
  \[ 4m = 3 \]
  \[ m = \frac{3}{4} \]
  Now, substituting \( m = \frac{3}{4} \) back into \( b = -4 - 3m \):
  \[ b = -4 - 3 \cdot \frac{3}{4} \]
  \[ b = -4 - \frac{9}{4} \]
  \[ b = -\frac{16}{4} - \frac{9}{4} \]
  \[ b = -\frac{25}{4} \]
  Finally, we compute \( m + b \):
  \[ m + b = \frac{3}{4} + \left(-\frac{25}{4}\right) = \frac{3 - 25}{4} = -\frac{22}{4} = -\frac{11}{2} \]
  However, this result does not match the expected value of 5. Let's re-evaluate the steps to ensure correctness.
