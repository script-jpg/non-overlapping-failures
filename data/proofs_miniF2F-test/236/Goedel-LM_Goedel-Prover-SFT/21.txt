  Given a line \(\ell\) that passes through the points \(B(7, -1)\) and \(C(-1, 7)\), we need to compute the equation of this line in the form \(y = mx + b\) and then determine \(m + b\).
  1. From the given points, we have the equations:
     \[
     m \cdot 7 + b = -1 \quad \text{(1)}
     \]
     \[
     m \cdot (-1) + b = 7 \quad \text{(2)}
     \]
  2. We solve these equations simultaneously to find \(m\) and \(b\).
  3. Subtract equation (2) from equation (1):
     \[
     (m \cdot 7 + b) - (m \cdot (-1) + b) = -1 - 7
     \]
     \[
     8m = -8
     \]
     \[
     m = -1
     \]
  4. Substitute \(m = -1\) back into equation (1):
     \[
     -1 \cdot 7 + b = -1
     \]
     \[
     -7 + b = -1
     \]
     \[
     b = 6
     \]
  5. Finally, compute \(m + b\):
     \[
     m + b = -1 + 6 = 5
     \]

  -- We start by solving the system of equations given by h₀ and h₁.
  have h : m = -1 := by
    -- Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate b.
    linarith
  have h' : b = 6 := by
    -- Substitute m = -1 into the first equation to solve for b.
    linarith
  -- Substitute the values of m and b into the expression m + b.
  rw [h, h']
  -- Verify that the result is 5.
