  Given a line \(\ell\) that passes through the points \(B(7, -1)\) and \(C(-1, 7)\), we need to find the equation of the line in the form \(y = mx + b\) and compute \(m + b\).
  1. From the given points, we have the equations:
     \[
     m \cdot 7 + b = -1 \quad \text{(1)}
     \]
     \[
     m \cdot (-1) + b = 7 \quad \text{(2)}
     \]
  2. Subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate \(b\):
     \[
     (m \cdot 7 + b) - (m \cdot (-1) + b) = -1 - 7
     \]
     \[
     8m = -8
     \]
     \[
     m = -1
     \]
  3. Substitute \(m = -1\) back into equation (1) to find \(b\):
     \[
     -1 \cdot 7 + b = -1
     \]
     \[
     -7 + b = -1
     \]
     \[
     b = 6
     \]
  4. Finally, compute \(m + b\):
     \[
     m + b = -1 + 6 = 5
     \]

  -- Subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate b and solve for m
  have h₂ : 8 * m = -8 := by
    linarith [h₀, h₁]
  -- Solve for m
  have h₃ : m = -1 := by
    linarith [h₂]
  -- Substitute m = -1 back into the first equation to solve for b
  have h₄ : b = 6 := by
    linarith [h₀, h₃]
  -- Compute the final value of m + b
  linarith [h₃, h₄]
