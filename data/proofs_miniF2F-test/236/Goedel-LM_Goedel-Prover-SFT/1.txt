  Given a line \(\ell\) that passes through the points \(B(7, -1)\) and \(C(-1, 7)\), we need to compute \(m + b\) where \(y = mx + b\) is the equation of this line. We are provided with the equations:
  1. \(7m + b = -1\)
  2. \(-m + b = 7\)
  To find \(m + b\), we can solve these equations simultaneously. First, we add the two equations:
  \[
  (7m + b) + (-m + b) = -1 + 7
  \]
  This simplifies to:
  \[
  6m + 2b = 6
  \]
  Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
  \[
  3m + b = 3
  \]
  Next, we solve for \(m\) and \(b\). From the first equation \(7m + b = -1\), we can express \(b\) as:
  \[
  b = -1 - 7m
  \]
  Substitute \(b\) into the second equation \(-m + b = 7\):
  \[
  -m + (-1 - 7m) = 7
  \]
  Simplify and solve for \(m\):
  \[
  -m - 1 - 7m = 7 \implies -8m - 1 = 7 \implies -8m = 8 \implies m = -1
  \]
  Now substitute \(m = -1\) back into \(b = -1 - 7m\):
  \[
  b = -1 - 7(-1) = -1 + 7 = 6
  \]
  Finally, compute \(m + b\):
  \[
  m + b = -1 + 6 = 5
  \]
