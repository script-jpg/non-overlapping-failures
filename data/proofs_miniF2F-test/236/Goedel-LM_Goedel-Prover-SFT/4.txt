  Given the points \( B(7, -1) \) and \( C(-1, 7) \), we need to find the line \(\ell\) passing through these points. The equation of this line can be written as \( y = mx + b \). We are to compute \( m + b \) and show that it equals 5.
  First, we use the given points to form a system of linear equations:
  1. \( 7m + b = -1 \)
  2. \( -m + b = 7 \)
  Next, we solve this system to find the values of \( m \) and \( b \).
  From the second equation, we can express \( b \) in terms of \( m \):
  \[ b = 7 + m \]
  Substitute \( b = 7 + m \) into the first equation:
  \[ 7m + (7 + m) = -1 \]
  \[ 7m + 7 + m = -1 \]
  \[ 8m + 7 = -1 \]
  \[ 8m = -8 \]
  \[ m = -1 \]
  Now substitute \( m = -1 \) back into the expression for \( b \):
  \[ b = 7 + (-1) \]
  \[ b = 6 \]
  Finally, we compute \( m + b \):
  \[ m + b = -1 + 6 = 5 \]
  Thus, the sum \( m + b \) is indeed 5.
