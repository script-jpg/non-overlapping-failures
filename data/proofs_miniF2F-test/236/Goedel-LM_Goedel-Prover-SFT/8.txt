  Given the points \( B(7, -1) \) and \( C(-1, 7) \), we need to find the equation of the line \( \ell \) passing through these points. The equation of the line can be written in the form \( y = mx + b \). We are given the equations:
  \[ m \cdot 7 + b = -1 \]
  \[ m \cdot -1 + b = 7 \]
  We need to show that \( m + b = 5 \).
  First, we simplify the given equations:
  \[ 7m + b = -1 \]
  \[ -m + b = 7 \]
  Next, we solve for \( m \) and \( b \) by adding and subtracting these equations. Adding the two equations:
  \[ (7m + b) + (-m + b) = -1 + 7 \]
  \[ 6m + 2b = 6 \]
  \[ 3m + b = 3 \]
  Subtracting the second equation from the first:
  \[ (7m + b) - (-m + b) = -1 - 7 \]
  \[ 8m = -8 \]
  \[ m = -1 \]
  Substituting \( m = -1 \) back into the equation \( 3m + b = 3 \):
  \[ 3(-1) + b = 3 \]
  \[ -3 + b = 3 \]
  \[ b = 6 \]
  Finally, we calculate \( m + b \):
  \[ m + b = -1 + 6 = 5 \]
