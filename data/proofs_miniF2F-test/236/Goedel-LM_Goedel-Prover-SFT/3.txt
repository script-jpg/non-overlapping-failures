  To solve the problem, we start by using the given points \( B(7, -1) \) and \( C(-1, 7) \) to find the equation of the line \( \ell \). The equation of a line can be written in the form \( y = mx + b \). Given the points, we can set up the following system of equations:
  \[
  \begin{cases}
  -1 = 7m + b \\
  7 = -m + b
  \end{cases}
  \]
  We solve this system step by step. First, we add the two equations to eliminate \( b \):
  \[
  (-1) + 7 = (7m + b) + (-m + b) \implies 6 = 6m + 2b \implies 3 = 3m + b
  \]
  Next, we solve for \( m \) and \( b \) by isolating \( b \):
  \[
  3 = 3m + b \implies b = 3 - 3m
  \]
  Substitute \( b = 3 - 3m \) back into the first equation:
  \[
  -1 = 7m + (3 - 3m) \implies -1 = 7m + 3 - 3m \implies -1 = 4m + 3 \implies 4m = -4 \implies m = -1
  \]
  Now substitute \( m = -1 \) back into the equation \( b = 3 - 3m \):
  \[
  b = 3 - 3(-1) \implies b = 3 + 3 \implies b = 6
  \]
  Finally, we compute \( m + b \):
  \[
  m + b = -1 + 6 = 5
  \]
  Thus, the value of \( m + b \) is \( 5 \).
