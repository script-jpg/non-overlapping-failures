  Given the line \(\ell\) passes through the points \(B(7, -1)\) and \(C(-1, 7)\), we need to find the equation of the line in the form \(y = mx + b\) and compute \(m + b\). We are provided with the equations \(m \cdot 7 + b = -1\) and \(m \cdot -1 + b = 7\). We will solve these equations to find \(m\) and \(b\) and then verify that \(m + b = 5\).
  First, we solve for \(m\) using the two given equations. We can use the method of elimination or substitution to find \(m\). Here, we will use elimination:
  \[
  \begin{cases}
  m \cdot 7 + b = -1 \\
  m \cdot -1 + b = 7
  \end{cases}
  \]
  Subtract the second equation from the first:
  \[
  (m \cdot 7 + b) - (m \cdot -1 + b) = -1 - 7
  \]
  Simplify the left-hand side:
  \[
  m \cdot 7 + b - m \cdot -1 - b = 8m
  \]
  Thus, we have:
  \[
  8m = -8
  \]
  Dividing both sides by 8:
  \[
  m = -1
  \]
  Next, substitute \(m = -1\) back into one of the original equations to solve for \(b\):
  \[
  -1 \cdot 7 + b = -1
  \]
  Simplify:
  \[
  -7 + b = -1
  \]
  Adding 7 to both sides:
  \[
  b = 6
  \]
  Finally, we have \(m = -1\) and \(b = 6\), so:
  \[
  m + b = -1 + 6 = 5
  \]
