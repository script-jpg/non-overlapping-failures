  Given a line \(\ell\) passing through the points \(B(7, -1)\) and \(C(-1, 7)\), we need to find the equation of this line in the form \(y = mx + b\) and compute \(m + b\). We are given the equations:
  1. \(7m + b = -1\)
  2. \(-m + b = 7\)
  To solve for \(m\) and \(b\), we can use these equations. First, we solve for \(m\) by isolating it in the second equation:
  \[
  -m + b = 7 \implies b = m + 7
  \]
  Next, substitute \(b = m + 7\) into the first equation:
  \[
  7m + (m + 7) = -1 \implies 7m + m + 7 = -1 \implies 8m + 7 = -1 \implies 8m = -8 \implies m = -1
  \]
  Now, substitute \(m = -1\) back into \(b = m + 7\):
  \[
  b = -1 + 7 = 6
  \]
  Finally, compute \(m + b\):
  \[
  m + b = -1 + 6 = 5
  \]
  Thus, the value of \(m + b\) is \(5\).
