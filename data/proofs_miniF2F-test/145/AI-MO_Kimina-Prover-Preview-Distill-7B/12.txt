This proof works because:
1. We start with the expression $\log_3 27$, which is defined as $\frac{\log 27}{\log 3}$ by change of base formula.
2. We recognize that $27 = 3^3$, so we rewrite $27$ as $3^3$ in the expression.
3. Using the logarithm power rule $\log(a^b) = b \cdot \log(a)$, we get $\log(3^3) = 3 \cdot \log(3)$.
4. Substituting back, we have $\frac{\log(3^3)}{\log(3)} = \frac{3 \cdot \log(3)}{\log(3)}$.
5. The $\log(3)$ terms cancel out, leaving us with $3$.
6. The final answer is indeed $3$.

The Lean 4 proof follows this mathematical reasoning exactly, using appropriate lemmas to formalize each step.
