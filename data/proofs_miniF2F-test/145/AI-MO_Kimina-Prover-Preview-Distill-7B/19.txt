This theorem statement is asking us to prove that $\log_3(27) = 3$. The expression $\log_3(27)$ can be rewritten using the change of base formula as $\frac{\log(27)}{\log(3)}$, where $\log$ represents the natural logarithm. 

To prove this, we start by recognizing that $27 = 3^3$. So we can rewrite $\log(27)$ as $\log(3^3)$. Using the logarithm power rule $\log(a^b) = b \cdot \log(a)$, we get $\log(3^3) = 3 \cdot \log(3)$.

So $\frac{\log(27)}{\log(3)} = \frac{3 \cdot \log(3)}{\log(3)} = 3$, which is what we need to prove.

In the Lean 4 proof:
1. We first rewrite $27$ as $3^3$ using the `show (27 : ℝ) = 3 ^ 3 by norm_num` part.
2. Then we apply the logarithm power rule using `Real.log_pow`.
3. After that, we apply the logarithm power rule again for the inner expression.
4. Finally, we use `norm_num` to simplify all numerical expressions and complete the proof.

Therefore, $\log_3(27) = 3$ is proven.
