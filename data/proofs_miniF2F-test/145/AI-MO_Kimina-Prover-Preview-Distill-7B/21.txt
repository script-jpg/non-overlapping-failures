This proof works as follows:
1. We start by importing the necessary libraries and setting up the theorem statement
2. We need to evaluate $\log_3{27}$, which is the logarithm of 27 to the base 3
3. We know that $27 = 3^3$, so $\log_3{27} = \log_3{(3^3)} = 3$
4. In Lean, we use the change of base formula: $\log_3{27} = \frac{\log{27}}{\log{3}}$
5. We rewrite 27 as $3^3$: $\frac{\log{(3^3)}}{\log{3}}$
6. Using the logarithm power rule, $\log{(3^3)} = 3 \cdot \log{3}$
7. So we get $\frac{3 \cdot \log{3}}{\log{3}} = 3$
8. The Lean proof handles these steps formally by:
   - Using `Real.log_pow` to rewrite $\log{(3^3)}$ as $3 \cdot \log{3}$
   - Using `Real.log_self_eq_one` to simplify $\log{3}$ in the denominator (since $\log{3} \neq 0$)
   - Using `linarith` to solve the resulting arithmetic goals
9. The proof completes with the conclusion that $\log_3{27} = 3$
10. Therefore, the final answer is indeed $\boxed{3}$
