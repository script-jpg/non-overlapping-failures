The proof of the theorem `mathd_algebra_484` shows that $\log_3 27 = 3$. Let's break down the steps:

1. We start by noting that $27 = 3^3$. This is a fundamental property of the number 27.
2. Using the change of base formula for logarithms, $\log_3 27 = \frac{\log 27}{\log 3}$.
3. Since $27 = 3^3$, we have $\log 27 = \log (3^3) = 3 \log 3$ (using the logarithm power rule).
4. Substituting this back, $\frac{\log 27}{\log 3} = \frac{3 \log 3}{\log 3} = 3$.
5. The condition $\log 3 \neq 0$ is satisfied because 3 is not equal to 1, and the logarithm of 1 is zero.

Therefore, $\log_3 27 = 3$.
