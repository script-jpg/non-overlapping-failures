This proof is evaluating $\log_3 27$ and showing that it equals 3. Let's break down the steps:

1. First, we recognize that $27 = 3^3$. This is a key insight because it allows us to use the logarithm power rule.
2. Using the change of base formula, $\log_3 27 = \frac{\log 27}{\log 3}$.
3. Since $27 = 3^3$, we have $\log 27 = \log (3^3) = 3 \log 3$ by the logarithm power rule.
4. Substituting this into our expression: $\frac{\log 27}{\log 3} = \frac{3 \log 3}{\log 3} = 3$.
5. The final answer is indeed 3.

The Lean proof formalizes these steps:

- `rw [show (27 : ℝ) = 3 ^ 3 by norm_num]` rewrites 27 as $3^3$.
- `rw [Real.log_pow]` applies the logarithm power rule to $\log (3^3)$, giving $3 \log 3$.
- `rw [Real.log_base_self_eq_one]` simplifies $\log 3 / \log 3$ to 1, using the fact that $\log_3 3 = 1$.
- `all_goals linarith` handles the remaining arithmetic goals, confirming that the expression equals 3.

Therefore, $\log_3 27 = 3$.
