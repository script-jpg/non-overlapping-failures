  To evaluate \(\log_3 27\), we start by expressing 27 as a power of 3. We know that \(27 = 3^3\). Using the definition of the logarithm, we have:
  \[
  \log_3 27 = \log_3 (3^3)
  \]
  Using the property of logarithms that \(\log_b (b^k) = k\), we get:
  \[
  \log_3 (3^3) = 3
  \]
  Thus, \(\log_3 27 = 3\).
