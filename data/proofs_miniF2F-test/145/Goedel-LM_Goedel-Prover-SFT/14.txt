  To evaluate \(\log_3 27\) and show that it is 3, we start by using the change of base formula for logarithms. The change of base formula states that \(\log_b a = \frac{\log_k a}{\log_k b}\) for any positive \(a\), \(b\), and \(k\). Here, we choose \(k = 3\).
  First, we express \(\log_3 27\) using the change of base formula:
  \[
  \log_3 27 = \frac{\log_3 27}{\log_3 3}
  \]
  Next, we simplify the numerator and the denominator separately. Since \(\log_3 27\) is the logarithm of 27 with base 3, we know that:
  \[
  \log_3 27 = \log_3 (3^3) = 3 \log_3 3
  \]
  Since \(\log_3 3 = 1\), we substitute this value in:
  \[
  \log_3 27 = 3 \cdot 1 = 3
  \]
  Now, we simplify the denominator:
  \[
  \log_3 3 = 1
  \]
  Thus, the expression simplifies to:
  \[
  \log_3 27 = \frac{3}{1} = 3
  \]
