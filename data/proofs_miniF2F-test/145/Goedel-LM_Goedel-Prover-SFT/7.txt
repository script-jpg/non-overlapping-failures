  To evaluate \(\log_3 27\) and show that it is 3, we start by expressing \(27\) as a power of \(3\). We know that \(27 = 3^3\). Using the definition of the logarithm, \(\log_b a = \frac{\log_k a}{\log_k b}\) for any positive bases \(b\), \(a\), and \(k\), we can rewrite \(\log_3 27\) as \(\frac{\log_3 27}{\log_3 3}\). Since \(\log_3 3 = 1\), this simplifies to \(\frac{\log_3 27}{1} = \log_3 27\). Given that \(27 = 3^3\), we have \(\log_3 27 = 3\).
