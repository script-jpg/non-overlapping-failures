  To evaluate \(\log_3 27\) and show that it is 3, we start by using the definition of the logarithm. The logarithm \(\log_b a\) is the exponent \(x\) such that \(b^x = a\). In this case, we need to find \(x\) such that \(3^x = 27\). 
  First, we express 27 as a power of 3:
  \[ 27 = 3^3 \]
  This is because \(3^3 = 27\). Therefore, we have:
  \[ \log_3 27 = \log_3 (3^3) \]
  Using the property of logarithms that \(\log_b (b^x) = x\), we get:
  \[ \log_3 (3^3) = 3 \]
  Thus, \(\log_3 27 = 3\).
