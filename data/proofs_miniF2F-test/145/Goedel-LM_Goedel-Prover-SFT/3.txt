  To evaluate \(\log_3 27\) and show that it is 3, we start by using the definition of the logarithm. The logarithm \(\log_b a\) is the exponent \(x\) such that \(b^x = a\). In this case, we need to find \(x\) such that \(3^x = 27\). 
  First, we recognize that \(27\) can be expressed as a power of \(3\):
  \[ 27 = 3^3 \]
  Thus, the equation \(3^x = 27\) becomes:
  \[ 3^x = 3^3 \]
  By the uniqueness of the exponent, we have:
  \[ x = 3 \]
  Therefore, \(\log_3 27 = 3\).
