  To evaluate \(\log_3 27\) and show that it is 3, we start by using the definition of the base-3 logarithm. We know that \(\log_3 27\) is the exponent \(x\) such that \(3^x = 27\). We can solve for \(x\) by noting that \(27 = 3^3\). Therefore, \(\log_3 27 = 3\).

  -- We know that 27 can be expressed as 3^3.
  have h₀ : (27 : ℝ) = 3 ^ 3 := by norm_num
  -- Using the property of logarithms, we can rewrite the logarithm of 27 to base 3.
