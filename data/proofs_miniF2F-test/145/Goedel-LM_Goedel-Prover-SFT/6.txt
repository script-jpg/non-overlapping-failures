  To evaluate \(\log_3 27\), we start by expressing 27 as a power of 3. We know that \(27 = 3^3\). Using the change of base formula for logarithms, \(\log_b a = \frac{\log_k a}{\log_k b}\) for any positive bases \(b\), \(a\), and \(k\), we can rewrite \(\log_3 27\) as \(\frac{\log_3 27}{\log_3 3}\). Since \(\log_3 3 = 1\), this simplifies to \(\frac{\log_3 27}{1} = \log_3 27\). Given that \(27 = 3^3\), we have \(\log_3 27 = \log_3 (3^3) = 3\).
