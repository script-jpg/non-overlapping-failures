  To evaluate \(\log_3 27\) and show that it is 3, we start by using the definition of the logarithm. The expression \(\log_3 27\) can be rewritten using the change of base formula for logarithms. Specifically, we use the fact that \(\log_b a = \frac{\log_k a}{\log_k b}\) for any positive bases \(b\), \(a\), and \(k\). Here, we choose \(k = 3\).
  First, we express \(\log_3 27\) using the change of base formula:
  \[
  \log_3 27 = \frac{\log_3 27}{\log_3 3}
  \]
  Since \(\log_3 3 = 1\) (because \(3^1 = 3\)), this simplifies to:
  \[
  \log_3 27 = \frac{\log_3 27}{1} = \log_3 27
  \]
  Next, we recognize that \(27\) can be expressed as \(3^3\). Therefore, we have:
  \[
  \log_3 27 = \log_3 (3^3)
  \]
  Using the property of logarithms that \(\log_b (b^x) = x\), we get:
  \[
  \log_3 (3^3) = 3
  \]
  Thus, we have shown that \(\log_3 27 = 3\).
