  To evaluate \(\log_3 27\) and show that it is 3, we start by using the definition of the logarithm. The logarithm \(\log_b a\) can be expressed as the exponent \(x\) such that \(b^x = a\). In this case, we need to find \(x\) such that \(3^x = 27\). 
  First, we recognize that \(27\) can be expressed as a power of \(3\):
  \[ 27 = 3^3 \]
  Thus, we have:
  \[ 3^3 = 27 \]
  This implies:
  \[ \log_3 27 = 3 \]
