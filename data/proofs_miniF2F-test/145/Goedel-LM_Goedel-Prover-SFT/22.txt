  To evaluate \(\log_3 27\), we start by expressing 27 as a power of 3. We know that \(27 = 3^3\). Using the property of logarithms that \(\log_b (b^x) = x\), we can directly conclude that \(\log_3 27 = 3\).

  rw [show (27 : ℝ) = 3 ^ 3 by norm_num]
  -- Using the property of logarithms, log_b (b^x) = x, we simplify the expression.
  simp [Real.log_rpow]
  -- The simplification step confirms that log_3 27 = 3.
