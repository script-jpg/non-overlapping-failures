  To evaluate \(\log_3 27\) and show that it equals 3, we start by using the definition of the logarithm. The logarithm \(\log_b a\) is defined as \(\frac{\log a}{\log b}\). Here, we have \(\log_3 27\). By the definition of the logarithm, this is \(\frac{\log 27}{\log 3}\).
  Next, we use the fact that \(27\) can be expressed as \(3^3\). Therefore, \(\log 27 = \log (3^3) = 3 \log 3\). Substituting this into our expression for \(\log_3 27\), we get:
  \[
  \log_3 27 = \frac{\log (3^3)}{\log 3} = \frac{3 \log 3}{\log 3} = 3
  \]
  Thus, \(\log_3 27 = 3\).
