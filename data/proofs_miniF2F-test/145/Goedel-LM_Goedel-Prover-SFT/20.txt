  To evaluate \(\log_3 27\) and show that it is 3, we start by using the definition of the base-3 logarithm. The base-3 logarithm \(\log_3 27\) can be rewritten using the change of base formula:
  \[
  \log_3 27 = \frac{\log 27}{\log 3}
  \]
  Next, we simplify the numerator and the denominator separately. Since \(27 = 3^3\), we have:
  \[
  \log 27 = \log (3^3) = 3 \log 3
  \]
  Thus, the expression becomes:
  \[
  \log_3 27 = \frac{3 \log 3}{\log 3} = 3
  \]
  Therefore, \(\log_3 27 = 3\).
