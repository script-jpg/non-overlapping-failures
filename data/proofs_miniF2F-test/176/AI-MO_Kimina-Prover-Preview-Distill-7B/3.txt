-- We substitute $a = 8$ into the expression $\left(16\sqrt[3]{a^2}\right)^{\frac 13}$.
  rw [h₀]

  -- Simplify the expression step by step.
  -- First, calculate $8^2 = 64$.
  -- Then, $\sqrt[3]{64} = 4$ because $4^3 = 64$.
  -- Next, $16 \times 4 = 64$.
  -- Finally, $\sqrt[3]{64} = 4$ again because $4^3 = 64$.
  norm_num

  -- Alternatively, we can use the `rw [show (16 * (8 : ℝ) ^ 2 ^ ((1 : ℝ) / 3)) ^ ((1 : ℝ) / 3) = (4 ^ (3 : ℝ)) ^ ((1 : ℝ) / 3) by norm_num]` tactic to simplify the expression by recognizing that all operations result in powers of 4.
  -- Then use `rw [← Real.rpow_mul]` to simplify further.
  -- Finally, use `norm_num` to get the result.
  -- The condition $0 \leq 4$ is trivially true and can be provided automatically by Lean.
  -- The condition $0 \leq 3$ is also trivially true and can be provided automatically by Lean.
  -- The condition $0 \leq \frac{1}{3}$ is trivially true and can be provided automatically by Lean.
