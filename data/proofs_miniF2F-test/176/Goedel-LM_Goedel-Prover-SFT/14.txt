  Given \( a = 8 \), we need to find the value of \( \left(16\sqrt[3]{a^2}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}} \).
  1. Substitute \( a = 8 \) into the expression.
  2. Calculate \( a^2 \), which is \( 8^2 = 64 \).
  3. Take the cube root of \( 64 \), which is \( \sqrt[3]{64} = 4 \).
  4. Multiply 16 by 4, resulting in 64.
  5. Take the cube root of 64, which is \( \sqrt[3]{64} = 4 \).
  Thus, the value of \( \left(16\sqrt[3]{a^2}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}} \) is 4.
