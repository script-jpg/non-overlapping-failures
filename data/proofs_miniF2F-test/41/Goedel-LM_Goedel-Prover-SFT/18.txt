  To determine how many integers between 15 and 85 are divisible by 20, we start by identifying the range of numbers we are considering. The numbers in this range are from 15 to 85. We need to find the numbers within this range that are divisible by 20.
  To find these numbers, we can use the property of divisibility by 20. A number is divisible by 20 if it is divisible by both 4 and 5. We can check the divisibility of each number in the range from 15 to 85 by 4 and 5.
