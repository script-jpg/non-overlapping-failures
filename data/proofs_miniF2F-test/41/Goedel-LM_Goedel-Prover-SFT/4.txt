  To determine how many integers between 15 and 85 are divisible by 20, we can follow these steps:
  1. **Identify the range of numbers**: The numbers in question are from 15 to 85.
  2. **Find the smallest and largest multiples of 20 within this range**:
     - The smallest multiple of 20 greater than or equal to 15 is 20.
     - The largest multiple of 20 less than or equal to 85 is 80.
  3. **Count the multiples of 20**:
     - The sequence of multiples of 20 in this range is an arithmetic sequence starting at 20 and ending at 80 with a common difference of 20.
     - The number of terms in this sequence can be found by solving the equation:
       \[
       20 + (n-1) \cdot 20 \leq 80
       \]
       Simplifying this inequality gives:
       \[
       20n \leq 80 \implies n \leq 4
       \]
     - Since we need the count of multiples, we include the endpoints:
       \[
       20, 40, 60, 80
       \]
  4. **Verify the count**: There are exactly 4 multiples of 20 within the range from 15 to 85.
