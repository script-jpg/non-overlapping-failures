  To determine how many integers between 15 and 85 are divisible by 20, we start by identifying the range of interest, which is from 15 to 85. We then filter this range to include only those integers that are divisible by 20. The integers that satisfy this condition are 20, 40, 60, and 80. Counting these integers, we find there are exactly 4 of them.

  -- Simplify the expression to count the number of integers in the range 15 to 85 that are divisible by 20.
  simp only [Finset.card, Finset.filter_eq, Finset.Icc, Finset.mem_Icc]
  -- The integers that are divisible by 20 within the range 15 to 85 are 20, 40, 60, and 80.
  -- We need to verify that the cardinality of this filtered set is 4.
