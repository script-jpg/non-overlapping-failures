  To determine how many integers between 15 and 85 are divisible by 20, we need to find the range of integers that satisfy this condition. The smallest integer greater than or equal to 15 that is divisible by 20 is 20, and the largest integer less than or equal to 85 that is divisible by 20 is 80. We then count the integers from 20 to 80 that are divisible by 20. This can be done by identifying the sequence of such integers and counting them.
