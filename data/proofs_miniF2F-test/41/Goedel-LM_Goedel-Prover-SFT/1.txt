  To determine how many integers between 15 and 85 are divisible by 20, we need to find the number of integers \( x \) in this range that satisfy \( 20 \mid x \). This can be achieved by filtering the integers from 15 to 85 based on the divisibility condition and then counting the number of such integers.

  -- We need to show that the number of integers between 15 and 85 that are divisible by 20 is 4.
  -- First, we filter the integers from 15 to 85 by the condition 20 ∣ x.
  -- Then, we count the number of such integers.
  apply Eq.symm
  -- We use the symmetry of equality to match the desired form.
