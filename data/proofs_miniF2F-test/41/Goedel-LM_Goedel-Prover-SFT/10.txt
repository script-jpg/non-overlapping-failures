  To determine how many integers between 15 and 85 are divisible by 20, we start by identifying the range of integers that satisfy the condition. The integers between 15 and 85 can be represented as \( x \) in the equation \( 15 \leq x \leq 85 \). We need to find the values of \( x \) that are divisible by 20.
  The integers divisible by 20 within this range can be found by solving the inequality \( 15 \leq x \leq 85 \) for \( x \) such that \( x \) is divisible by 20. This can be done by checking the multiples of 20 within the given range.
  The multiples of 20 within the range \( 15 \leq x \leq 85 \) are:
  - \( 20 \times 1 = 20 \)
  - \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \)
  - \( 20 \times 3 = 60 \)
  - \( 20 \times 4 = 80 \)
  Thus, there are 4 integers divisible by 20 within the range from 15 to 85.
