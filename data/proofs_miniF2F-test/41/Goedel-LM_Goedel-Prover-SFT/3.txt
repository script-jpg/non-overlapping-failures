  To determine how many integers between 15 and 85 are divisible by 20, we need to find the number of integers in the range that are multiples of 20. We start by identifying the smallest and largest such integers.
  1. The smallest integer greater than or equal to 15 that is a multiple of 20 is 20.
  2. The largest integer less than or equal to 85 that is a multiple of 20 is 80.
  Next, we count the number of multiples of 20 between 20 and 80. This can be done by finding the difference between the largest and smallest multiples of 20 within the specified range and then dividing by 20.
