  To determine how many integers between 15 and 85 are divisible by 20, we can follow these steps:
  1. **Identify the range of interest**: We are interested in the integers from 15 to 85.
  2. **Determine the multiples of 20 within the range**: We need to find the integers \( x \) such that \( 20 \mid x \) and \( 15 \leq x \leq 85 \).
  3. **Identify the smallest and largest multiples of 20 within the range**:
     - The smallest multiple of 20 greater than or equal to 15 is 20.
     - The largest multiple of 20 less than or equal to 85 is 80.
  4. **Count the multiples**:
     - The multiples of 20 between 20 and 80 are \( 20, 40, 60, 80 \).
     - There are 4 such multiples.
  Thus, the number of integers between 15 and 85 that are divisible by 20 is 4.
