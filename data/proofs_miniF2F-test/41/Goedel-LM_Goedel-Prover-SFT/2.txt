  To determine how many integers between 15 and 85 are divisible by 20, we need to find the numbers that satisfy the condition \(20 \mid x\) within the specified range. We can express this as a filtered subset of the set of integers from 15 to 85, where each element \(x\) is checked for divisibility by 20. The cardinality of this filtered set is then computed to be 4.

  -- We use a decision procedure to verify the cardinality of the filtered set.

  -- The `decide` tactic will automatically check the cardinality and confirm it is 4.

  -- The `decide` tactic will handle the verification of the cardinality.
