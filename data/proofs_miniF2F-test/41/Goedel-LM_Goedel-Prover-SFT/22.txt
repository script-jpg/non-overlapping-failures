  To determine how many integers between 15 and 85 are divisible by 20, we need to find the number of integers that satisfy the condition \( 15 \leq x \leq 85 \) and \( 20 \mid x \). This can be achieved by counting the numbers in the specified range that are divisible by 20.
  The sequence of numbers divisible by 20 within the range 15 to 85 can be represented as \( 20k \) where \( k \) is an integer. We need to find the values of \( k \) such that \( 15 \leq 20k \leq 85 \).
  First, solve for the lower bound:
  \[ 15 \leq 20k \]
  \[ \frac{15}{20} \leq k \]
  \[ 0.75 \leq k \]
  Since \( k \) must be an integer, the smallest possible value for \( k \) is 1.
  Next, solve for the upper bound:
  \[ 20k \leq 85 \]
  \[ k \leq \frac{85}{20} \]
  \[ k \leq 4.25 \]
  Since \( k \) must be an integer, the largest possible value for \( k \) is 4.
  Thus, the integers \( k \) that satisfy \( 1 \leq k \leq 4 \) are \( k = 1, 2, 3, 4 \). Therefore, there are 4 integers between 15 and 85 that are divisible by 20.

  -- We need to count the number of integers in the range [15, 85] that are divisible by 20.
  -- These integers can be represented as 20k where k is an integer.
  -- We need to find the values of k such that 15 ≤ 20k ≤ 85.
  -- Solving the inequalities:
  -- 15 ≤ 20k ≤ 85
  -- 0.75 ≤ k ≤ 4.25
  -- Since k must be an integer, the possible values for k are 1, 2, 3, and 4.
  -- Therefore, there are 4 such integers.
