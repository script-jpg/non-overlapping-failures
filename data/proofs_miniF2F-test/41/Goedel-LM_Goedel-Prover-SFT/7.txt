  To determine how many integers between 15 and 85 are divisible by 20, we can follow these steps:
  1. **Identify the range and divisibility condition**: We are interested in the integers \( x \) such that \( 15 \leq x \leq 85 \) and \( x \mod 20 = 0 \).
  2. **Find the smallest and largest multiples of 20 within the range**:
     - The smallest multiple of 20 greater than or equal to 15 is \( 20 \times 1 = 20 \).
     - The largest multiple of 20 less than or equal to 85 is \( 20 \times 4 = 80 \).
  3. **Count the multiples of 20**:
     - The sequence of multiples of 20 in the range is \( 20, 40, 60, 80 \).
     - There are exactly 4 terms in this sequence.
  Thus, there are 4 integers between 15 and 85 that are divisible by 20.
