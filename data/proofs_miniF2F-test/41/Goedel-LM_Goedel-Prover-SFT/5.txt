  To determine how many integers between 15 and 85 are divisible by 20, we need to count the integers that satisfy the condition \(20 \mid x\). This can be achieved by finding the smallest and largest multiples of 20 within the given range and counting the numbers between these bounds.
  1. **Identify the smallest multiple of 20 greater than or equal to 15:**
     - The smallest multiple of 20 greater than or equal to 15 is 20.
  2. **Identify the largest multiple of 20 less than or equal to 85:**
     - The largest multiple of 20 less than or equal to 85 is 80.
  3. **Count the multiples of 20 between 20 and 80:**
     - The sequence of multiples of 20 between 20 and 80 is \(20, 40, 60, 80\).
     - There are exactly 4 terms in this sequence.
  Thus, the number of integers between 15 and 85 that are divisible by 20 is 4.
