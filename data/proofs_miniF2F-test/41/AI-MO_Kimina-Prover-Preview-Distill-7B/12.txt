-- We need to find the number of integers between 15 and 85 (inclusive) that are divisible by 20.

  -- First, let's identify the integers in the range [15, 85] that are divisible by 20.
  -- The smallest number in the range divisible by 20 is 20 itself, and the largest is 80.
  -- The numbers are: 20, 40, 60, 80.

  -- We can represent this as a finite set and use Lean's computational engine to determine the cardinality.

    -- We need to prove that the set of numbers divisible by 20 in the range [15, 85] equals {20, 40, 60, 80}.

    -- We'll prove that an integer x is in the filtered set if and only if it is in {20, 40, 60, 80}.
