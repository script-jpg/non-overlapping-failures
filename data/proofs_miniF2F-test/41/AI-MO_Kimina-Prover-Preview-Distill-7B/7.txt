-- Answer: 4.

  -- We find the integers between 15 and 85 that are divisible by 20.
  -- These integers are 20, 40, 60, and 80.
  -- There are 4 such integers.

  -- Write the Lean 4 proof as follows:
  rw [Finset.card_filter]
  calc
    -- Use `#i` to represent the set of integers between 15 and 85 that are divisible by 20.
    _ = #i.filter (fun x => 20 ∣ x).card := by rfl
    -- Use `#B` as a shorthand for `Finset.Icc 15 85`.
    _ = #B.filter (fun x => 20 ∣ x).card := by rfl
    -- Write out the elements of `#B` that satisfy the predicate `20 ∣ x`.
    _ = {80, 60, 40, 20}.card := by rfl
    -- There are 4 elements in the set `{80, 60, 40, 20}`.
    _ = 4 := by simp
