-- We need to find the number of integers between 15 and 85 (inclusive) that are divisible by 20.

  -- The integers divisible by 20 between 15 and 85 are 20, 40, 60, and 80. So there are 4 such integers.

  simp [Finset.card_filter]
  rfl
```

The Lean proof is remarkably concise because Lean's library provides powerful tools for working with finite sets and arithmetic.

1. `Finset.filter` is used to select elements from the closed interval [15, 85] that are divisible by 20.
2. The divisibility relation `∣` is the standard notation in Lean for "divides".
3. `Finset.Icc 15 85` creates the closed interval from 15 to 85.
4. Lean's computational engine can determine that exactly four numbers in this range are divisible by 20: 20, 40, 60, and 80.
5. The `simp` tactic is expanding the definition of the filtered set and computing its cardinality.
6. The `rfl` (reflexivity) tactic is proving that the computed cardinality equals 4, which is the expected result.

Therefore, the answer is 4, as Lean's computational capabilities have verified.
