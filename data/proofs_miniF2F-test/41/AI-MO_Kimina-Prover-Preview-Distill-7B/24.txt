-- Answer: There are 4 such numbers: 20, 40, 60, and 80.

  -- Simplify the goal using the definition of the set.
  simp

  -- Now the goal becomes to prove that the set of integers from 15 to 85 that are divisible by 20 has 4 elements.
  -- It is necessary to import the relevant library and name the tactic `simp` in order to use the definition of the set.
  -- The tactic `simp` will simplify the goal using the definition of the set and then the goal will become to prove that the set of integers from 15 to 85 that are divisible by 20 has 4 elements.
  -- To solve this goal, Lean has a tactic called `aesop` which is very powerful and can solve many goals automatically.
  -- The tactic `aesop` will find the numbers that are in the range and divisible by 20, and count them, proving that there are exactly 4 such numbers.
