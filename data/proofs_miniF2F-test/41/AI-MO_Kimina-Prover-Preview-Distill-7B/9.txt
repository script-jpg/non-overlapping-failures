-- We need to find the number of integers between 15 and 85 (inclusive) that are divisible by 20.

  -- The integers between 15 and 85 that are divisible by 20 are 20, 40, 60, and 80. There are 4 such numbers.

  -- To solve this problem formally in Lean 4, we can:

  -- 1. Create a finite set of integers from 15 to 85 using `Finset.Icc`.
  -- 2. Filter this set to keep only the numbers divisible by 20.
  -- 3. Count the elements in the filtered set.

  -- Let's start by importing the necessary libraries and setting up the theorem statement:

  import Mathlib
  import Aesop

  set_option maxHeartbeats 0

  open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat

  -- Now we'll define the theorem:

  theorem mathd_numbertheory_12 :
      Finset.card (Finset.filter (fun x => 20 ∣ x) (Finset.Icc 15 85)) = 4 := by

    -- We need to compute the cardinality of the set of integers between 15 and 85 (inclusive) that are divisible by 20.

    -- The numbers divisible by 20 in this range are 20, 40, 60, and 80. There are 4 such numbers.

    -- Lean has powerful tools for working with finite sets and number theory properties. We can compute this directly:

    native_decide

  -- The `native_decide` tactic is powerful for computational problems like this one. It can evaluate the expression directly.

  -- To elaborate on why the answer is 4: 

  -- - The smallest multiple of 20 greater than or equal to 15 is 20 itself (20 = 20 × 1).
  -- - The next multiple is 40 (20 × 2).
  -- - Then 60 (20 × 3).
  -- - Then 80 (20 × 4).
  -- - The next multiple, 100, is greater than 85 and thus outside our range.

  -- So the numbers 20, 40, 60, and 80 are the integers between 15 and 85 that are divisible by 20, and there are 4 of them.

  -- This gives us the final answer of 4.
