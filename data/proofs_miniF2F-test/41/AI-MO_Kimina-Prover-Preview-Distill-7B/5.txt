-- We need to find the count of integers between 15 and 85 (inclusive) that are divisible by 20.

  -- The integers between 15 and 85 that are divisible by 20 are 20, 40, 60, and 80.
  -- Thus, there are 4 such integers.

  -- We will use `Finset.filter` to find the numbers divisible by 20 in the range, then count them.

  -- The numbers divisible by 20 in the range [15, 85] are 20, 40, 60, 80
  -- So the filtered set is {20, 40, 60, 80}
