-- Answer: 4.

  -- We find the number of integers between 15 and 85 that are divisible by 20.
  have : (Finset.filter (fun x => 20 ∣ x) (Finset.Icc 15 85)) = {20, 40, 60, 80} := by
    -- We prove this by showing both inclusions.
    ext x
    constructor

    -- Firstly, we show that if x is in the set on the left, then x is in the set on the right.
    · intro hx
      -- We know that x is in the range [15, 85] and divisible by 20.
      have ⟨hx1, hx2⟩ := hx
      have hx3 : x ≠ 0 := by
        linarith

      -- We do casework on the value of x.
      interval_cases x
      -- None of the cases are possible, as x must be divisible by 20.
      all_goals
        contradiction

    -- Now, we show that if x is in the set on the right, then x is in the set on the left.
    · intro hx
      -- We know that x is one of {20, 40, 60, 80}.
      simp at hx
      obtain hx | hx | hx | hx := hx
      all_goals
        -- For each case, we show that x is in the range [15, 85] and divisible by 20.
        simp [hx]
  
  -- We substitute the set we found into the original expression.
  rw [this]
  -- We simplify to get the final result.
  simp
