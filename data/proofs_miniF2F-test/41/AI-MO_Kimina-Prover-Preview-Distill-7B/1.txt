-- We need to find the number of integers between 15 and 85 (inclusive) that are divisible by 20.

  -- The integers between 15 and 85 that are divisible by 20 are 20, 40, 60, and 80. So there are 4 such integers.

  -- We can prove this by showing that the set of integers between 15 and 85 that are divisible by 20 is {20, 40, 60, 80} and then counting the elements in this set.

  -- First, let's identify the integers between 15 and 85 that are divisible by 20:
  -- - 20 is divisible by 20 and is greater than 15
  -- - 40 is divisible by 20 and is greater than 15
  -- - 60 is divisible by 20 and is greater than 15
  -- - 80 is divisible by 20 and is greater than 15
  -- - 100 is divisible by 20 but is not less than or equal to 85

  -- So the set is {20, 40, 60, 80}.

  -- Now, let's write the Lean proof:

  have : (Finset.filter (fun x => 20 ∣ x) (Finset.Icc 15 85)) = {20, 40, 60, 80} := by
    -- We need to prove that the set of integers between 15 and 85 that are divisible by 20 is exactly {20, 40, 60, 80}
    ext x
    -- We will prove that x is in the left set if and only if x is in the right set
    simp [Finset.mem_filter, Finset.mem_Icc, Finset.mem_insert, Finset.mem_singleton]
    -- We need to show that x is in the range [15, 85] and divisible by 20 if and only if x is one of 20, 40, 60, or 80
    constructor
    · -- Assume x is in the left set
      rintro ⟨⟨hx1, hx2⟩, hx3⟩
      -- We have 15 ≤ x ≤ 85 and 20 ∣ x
      -- We need to prove that x is one of 20, 40, 60, or 80
      omega
    · -- Assume x is in the right set
      rintro (rfl | rfl | rfl | rfl)
      all_goals
        -- We need to prove that each of these numbers is in the left set
        constructor
        · norm_num
        · norm_num
  -- Now that we have established the equality of the two sets, we can compute the cardinality
  rw [this]
  -- The cardinality of the set {20, 40, 60, 80} is 4
