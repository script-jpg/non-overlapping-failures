-- Answer: 4.

  -- We find the integers between 15 and 85 that are divisible by 20.
  -- 20 × 1 = 20 (not between 15 and 85)
  -- 20 × 2 = 40 (between 15 and 85)
  -- 20 × 3 = 60 (between 15 and 85)
  -- 20 × 4 = 80 (between 15 and 85)
  -- 20 × 5 = 100 (not between 15 and 85)
  -- Thus, there are 4 integers between 15 and 85 that are divisible by 20.

  have : (Finset.filter (fun x => 20 ∣ x) (Finset.Icc 15 85)) = {40, 60, 80} := by
