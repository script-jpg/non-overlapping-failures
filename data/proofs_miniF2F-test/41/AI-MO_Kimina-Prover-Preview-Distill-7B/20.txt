-- We need to find the number of integers between 15 and 85 (inclusive) that are divisible by 20.

  -- The integers between 15 and 85 that are divisible by 20 are: 20, 40, 60, 80. So there are 4 such integers.

The Lean proof is remarkably concise because Lean's computational engine can directly evaluate this finite problem. The `native_decide` tactic is powerful enough to compute the exact set of integers between 15 and 85 that are divisible by 20, and then count them, confirming that there are exactly 4 such integers: 20, 40, 60, and 80.

In a more complex number theory problem, we might need to prove something about divisibility for all integers, not just a finite set. For those cases, we would use more elaborate proof techniques involving properties of divisibility and arithmetic. However, for this specific, finite problem, Lean's computational capability is sufficient to provide a direct and elegant proof.
