  To show that the product of all positive odd integers less than 10000 is given by \(\dfrac{10000!}{(2^{5000} \cdot 5000!)}\), we start by expressing the product of all odd integers up to 10000. This product can be written as:
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^{5000} (2k - 1)
  \]
  This product includes each odd integer from 1 to 9999, and we can use the formula for the product of the first \(n\) odd numbers, which is known to be:
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^{n} (2k - 1) = \frac{(2n)!}{2^n \cdot n!}
  \]
  For \(n = 5000\), we have:
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^{5000} (2k - 1) = \frac{(2 \cdot 5000)!}{2^{5000} \cdot 5000!}
  \]
  Thus, the product of all positive odd integers less than 10000 is:
  \[
  \frac{10000!}{2^{5000} \cdot 5000!}
  \]

  -- Use the fact that the product of all odd integers less than 10000 can be expressed in terms of factorials.
  -- The product of the first 5000 odd numbers is given by (2 * 5000)! / (2^5000 * 5000!).
  -- This can be simplified to 10000! / (2^5000 * 5000!).

  -- Apply the formula for the product of the first n odd numbers.
  -- The product of the first 5000 odd numbers is (2 * 5000)! / (2^5000 * 5000!).
  -- This matches the given form.
