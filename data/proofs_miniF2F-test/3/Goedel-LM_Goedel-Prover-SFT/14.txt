  To show that the product of all positive odd integers less than 10000 is equal to \(\dfrac{10000!}{2^{5000} \cdot 5000!}\), we start by considering the set of odd integers in the range from 1 to 9999. The product of these odd integers can be expressed in terms of factorials and powers of 2. Specifically, we can use the fact that the product of the first \(n\) odd integers is given by \(n!\) divided by the product of the first \(n\) even integers. Here, we need to account for the fact that the product of the first 5000 odd integers is \(\dfrac{10000!}{2^{5000} \cdot 5000!}\).
