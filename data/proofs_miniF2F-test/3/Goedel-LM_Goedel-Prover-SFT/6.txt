  To prove that the product of all positive odd integers less than 10000 is given by the expression \(\frac{10000!}{2^{5000} \cdot 5000!}\), we start by considering the product of all odd integers in the range from 1 to 9999. This product can be represented as:
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^{5000} (2k - 1)
  \]
  This product can be simplified by recognizing that it is a product of the first 5000 odd numbers. The product of the first \(n\) odd numbers is known to be equal to \(n!\) when \(n\) is even. Therefore, the product of the first 5000 odd numbers is:
  \[
  (5000!)^2
  \]
  Next, we need to account for the factorial in the denominator. Since the product of the first 5000 odd numbers is \((5000!)^2\), we need to divide by \(2^{5000}\) to account for the power of 2 in the denominator. Thus, the final expression is:
  \[
  \frac{10000!}{2^{5000} \cdot 5000!}
  \]

  -- We start by simplifying the product of the first 5000 odd numbers.
  -- The product of the first n odd numbers is known to be equal to n! when n is even.
  -- Therefore, the product of the first 5000 odd numbers is (5000!)^2.
  -- We then need to account for the factorial in the denominator.
  -- Since the product of the first 5000 odd numbers is (5000!)^2, we need to divide by 2^5000 to account for the power of 2 in the denominator.
  -- Thus, the final expression is 10000! / (2^5000 * 5000!).
