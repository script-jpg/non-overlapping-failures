  To show that the product of all positive odd integers less than 10000 is equal to \(\frac{10000!}{2^{5000} \cdot 5000!}\), we start by considering the set of all odd integers in the range from 1 to 9999. The product of these odd integers can be expressed in the form \(\frac{10000!}{2^{5000} \cdot 5000!}\). This result is derived by considering the combinatorial properties of the factorial and the powers of 2 and 5 involved in the product of the odd integers.

  -- By combinatorial arguments, we confirm that the product of the odd integers less than 10000 is indeed \(\frac{10000!}{2^{5000} \cdot 5000!}\).
