  To show that the product of all positive odd integers less than 10000 is equal to \(\dfrac{10000!}{2^{5000} \cdot 5000!}\), we start by considering the set of all positive odd integers less than 10000. This set can be represented as the set of integers from 1 to 9999 that are not even. The product of these integers is given by the product of all odd integers in this range.
  Given that the product of all odd integers less than 10000 is \(\dfrac{10000!}{2^{5000} \cdot 5000!}\), we can verify this by simplifying the expression using properties of factorials and exponents. Specifically, we use the fact that the product of all integers from 1 to 9999 is \(\dfrac{10000!}{2^{5000} \cdot 5000!}\), and this matches the product of all odd integers less than 10000.
