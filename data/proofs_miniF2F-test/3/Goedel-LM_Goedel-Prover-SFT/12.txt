  To show that the product of all positive odd integers less than 10000 is \(\dfrac{10000!}{2^{5000} \cdot 5000!}\), we start by considering the set of odd integers from 1 to 9999. The product of these integers can be expressed in terms of factorials and powers of 2. Specifically, the product of all odd integers less than 10000 is given by:
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^{5000} (2k - 1)
  \]
  This product can be rewritten using the factorial of 10000 and the factorial of 5000. The key insight is that the product of the first 5000 odd integers is equal to the product of the first 5000 integers divided by the product of the first 5000 even integers. Since the product of the first 5000 even integers is \(2^{5000}\), we have:
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^{5000} (2k - 1) = \frac{10000!}{2^{5000} \cdot 5000!}
  \]
  This completes the proof.

  -- We use the fact that the product of the first 5000 odd integers is equal to the product of the first 5000 integers divided by the product of the first 5000 even integers.
  -- The product of the first 5000 even integers is \(2^{5000}\), so we have:
