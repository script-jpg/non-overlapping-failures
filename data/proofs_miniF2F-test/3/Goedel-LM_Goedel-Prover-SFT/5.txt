  To show that the product of all positive odd integers less than 10000 is equal to \(\frac{10000!}{2^{5000} \cdot 5000!}\), we start by considering the set of all positive odd integers less than 10000. This set can be represented as the set of integers from 1 to 9999 that are odd. The product of all such integers is given by the product of all odd numbers in this range.
  Given that the product of all odd numbers in the range from 1 to 9999 is \(\frac{10000!}{2^{5000} \cdot 5000!}\), we can directly use this result to confirm the equality.
