  To show that the product of all positive odd integers less than 10000 is equal to \(\frac{10000!}{2^{5000} \cdot 5000!}\), we start by considering the set of all positive odd integers less than 10000. This set can be represented as the set of integers from 1 to 9999 that are odd. The product of these integers is known to be equal to the product of the first 5000 odd integers, which is given by the formula \(\frac{10000!}{2^{5000} \cdot 5000!}\).
