  To show that the product of all positive odd integers less than 10000 is equal to \(\frac{10000!}{2^{5000} \cdot 5000!}\), we start by considering the set of all odd integers less than 10000. This set can be represented as the set of all integers from 0 to 9999 that are not even. The product of these integers is given by the product over the set of odd integers. We then simplify this product using the properties of factorials and powers of 2.
