  To show that the product of all positive odd integers less than 10000 is \(\dfrac{10000!}{2^{5000} \cdot 5000!}\), we start by considering the set of all positive odd integers less than 10000. This set can be represented as \(\{2k + 1 \mid k \in \mathbb{N}, k < 5000\}\). The product of these integers is given by the product of the sequence \(\{2k + 1\}\) for \(k\) ranging from 0 to 4999.
  The product of the first 5000 odd integers is known to be \(\dfrac{10000!}{2^{5000}}\). However, we need to account for the fact that the product of the first 5000 odd integers is actually \(\dfrac{10000!}{2^{5000} \cdot 5000!}\). This is because the product of the first 5000 odd integers includes the factorial of 10000 divided by the product of the first 5000 even integers, which simplifies to \(\dfrac{10000!}{2^{5000} \cdot 5000!}\).
