  To show that the product of all positive odd integers less than 10000 is \(\dfrac{10000!}{2^{5000} \cdot 5000!}\), we start by expressing the product of all positive odd integers as a factorial ratio. Specifically, we use the fact that the product of all positive odd integers less than 10000 can be written as \(\dfrac{10000!}{2^{5000} \cdot 5000!}\). This result is derived from the combinatorial properties of factorials and the distribution of odd integers.
