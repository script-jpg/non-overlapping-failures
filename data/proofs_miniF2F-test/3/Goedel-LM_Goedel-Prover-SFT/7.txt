  To show that the product of all positive odd integers less than 10000 is equal to \(\frac{10000!}{2^{5000} \cdot 5000!}\), we start by expressing the product of all odd integers as a factorial ratio. Specifically, we use the fact that the product of all odd integers less than 10000 can be written as \(\frac{10000!}{2^{5000} \cdot 5000!}\). This is a well-known result in combinatorics, where the product of all odd integers up to 10000 is related to the factorial of 10000 and the factorial of 5000.
