  To prove that the product of all positive odd integers less than 10000 is equal to \(\frac{10000!}{2^{5000} \cdot 5000!}\), we start by expressing the product of all odd integers up to 10000. This product can be written as:
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^{5000} (2k - 1)
  \]
  where \(2k - 1\) represents the \(k\)-th odd integer. The product of these odd integers is known to be equal to the product of all integers up to 10000 divided by the product of all even integers up to 10000. Specifically, the product of all integers up to 10000 is \(10000!\), and the product of all even integers up to 10000 is \(2^{5000} \cdot 5000!\). Therefore, the product of all odd integers up to 10000 is:
  \[
  \frac{10000!}{2^{5000} \cdot 5000!}
