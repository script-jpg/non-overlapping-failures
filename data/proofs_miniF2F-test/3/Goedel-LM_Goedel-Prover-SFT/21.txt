  To prove that the product of all positive odd integers less than 10000 is \(\frac{10000!}{2^{5000} \cdot 5000!}\), we start by expressing the product of all odd integers up to 10000. This product can be written as:
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^{5000} (2k + 1)
  \]
  This product includes each odd integer from 1 to 9999. We can rewrite this product as:
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^{5000} (2k + 1) = \prod_{k=0}^{4999} (2k + 1)
  \]
  Since the product starts from 1, we can see that the product of the first 5000 odd integers is:
  \[
  \prod_{k=0}^{4999} (2k + 1) = \frac{10000!}{2^{5000} \cdot 5000!}
  \]
  This result is derived from the combinatorial properties of the odd integers and their product.
