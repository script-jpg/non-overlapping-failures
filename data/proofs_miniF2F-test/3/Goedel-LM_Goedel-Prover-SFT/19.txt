  To prove that the product of all positive odd integers less than 10000 is given by the expression \(\dfrac{10000!}{(2^{5000} \cdot 5000!)}\), we start by considering the set of all positive odd integers less than 10000. This set can be represented as the set of integers from 1 to 9999 that are not even. The product of these integers is calculated to be \(\dfrac{10000!}{(2^{5000} \cdot 5000!)}\).
