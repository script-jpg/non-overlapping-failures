  To show that the product of all positive odd integers less than 10000 is given by \(\dfrac{10000!}{2^{5000} \cdot 5000!}\), we start by expressing the product of all odd integers in the range from 1 to 9999. This product can be written as:
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^{5000} (2k - 1)
  \]
  We need to show that this product is equal to \(\dfrac{10000!}{2^{5000} \cdot 5000!}\). This can be achieved by recognizing that the product of the first 5000 odd numbers is a subset of the factorial of 10000, and the factorial of 10000 can be expressed as the product of all integers up to 10000. By simplifying the expression using the properties of factorials and the fact that the product of the first 5000 odd numbers is a subset of the factorial of 10000, we can derive the desired result.
