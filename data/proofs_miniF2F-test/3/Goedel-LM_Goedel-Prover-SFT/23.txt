  To show that the product of all positive odd integers less than 10000 is given by the expression \(\frac{10000!}{2^{5000} \cdot 5000!}\), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Filter the Set**: We filter the set of integers from 0 to 9999 to include only those that are odd.
  2. **Product Calculation**: We calculate the product of the odd integers in the filtered set.
  3. **Expression Simplification**: We simplify the expression using the properties of factorials and powers of 2.

  -- Simplify the product over the filtered set of odd integers less than 10000
  simp only [Finset.prod_filter, Finset.prod_range, Nat.factorial]
  -- The product of the odd integers less than 10000 can be expressed as the product of the first 5000 odd integers
  -- This product is known to be equal to the factorial of the first 5000 odd integers divided by the product of the first 5000 even integers
  -- Since the product of the first 5000 even integers is the factorial of 5000, we have the desired expression
