  To determine the product of all positive odd integers less than 10000, we start by expressing the product of the first 5000 odd integers. The \(n\)-th odd integer is given by \(2n - 1\). Therefore, the product of the first 5000 odd integers is:
  \[
  \prod_{n=1}^{5000} (2n - 1)
  \]
  We can rewrite this product as:
  \[
  \prod_{n=1}^{5000} (2n - 1) = \prod_{n=1}^{5000} (2n - 1) \cdot 2^{5000} \cdot 5000!
  \]
  This is because the product of the first 5000 odd integers can be expressed as:
  \[
  \prod_{n=1}^{5000} (2n - 1) = 1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot \ldots \cdot 9999
  \]
  and the factor \(2^{5000} \cdot 5000!\) accounts for the arrangement of the odd integers in a specific order.
  Thus, the product of all positive odd integers less than 10000 is:
  \[
  \frac{10000!}{2^{5000} \cdot 5000!}
  \]
