  To prove that the product of all positive odd integers less than 10000 is given by the expression \(\dfrac{10000!}{2^{5000} \cdot 5000!}\), we start by considering the set of all positive odd integers less than 10000. This set can be represented as the set of integers from 1 to 9999 that are odd. The product of these integers can be expressed using factorial and power of 2.
  First, we note that the product of all integers from 1 to 9999 can be written as \(9999!\). Since the integers are odd, we need to exclude the even numbers, which are multiples of 2. The number of even numbers less than 10000 is 5000, as there are 5000 multiples of 2 up to 10000. Therefore, the product of the odd numbers is \(9999!\) divided by \(2^{5000}\).
  Next, we need to account for the fact that the product includes the number 10000, which is not an odd number. Thus, we divide by \(2^{5000}\) again to correct for the even number 10000.
  Finally, we need to show that the product of all positive odd integers less than 10000 is \(\dfrac{10000!}{2^{5000} \cdot 5000!}\).
