  To show that the product of all positive odd integers less than 10000 is equal to \(\dfrac{10000!}{2^{5000} \cdot 5000!}\), we start by considering the set of all positive odd integers less than 10000. This set can be represented as a filtered subset of the range from 0 to 9999, where each element is odd. The product of these elements is then computed and shown to be equal to the given expression.
