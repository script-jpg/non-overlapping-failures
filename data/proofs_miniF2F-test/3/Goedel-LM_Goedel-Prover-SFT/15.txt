  To show that the product of all positive odd integers less than 10000 is equal to \(\dfrac{10000!}{2^{5000} \cdot 5000!}\), we start by considering the set of all positive odd integers less than 10000. This set can be represented as the set of integers \(x\) such that \(x \equiv 1 \pmod{2}\).
  The product of all such integers less than 10000 is given by the product of all \(x\) in the range from 1 to 9999 that satisfy \(x \equiv 1 \pmod{2}\). This can be simplified by recognizing that every second number in the range is odd, and thus the product of all odd numbers less than 10000 is a specific value.
  The number of odd integers less than 10000 is 5000, as there are 5000 odd numbers in the range from 1 to 9999. The product of these numbers can be expressed as:
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^{5000} (2k - 1)
  \]
  This product can be simplified by noting that the product of the first \(n\) odd numbers is known to be \(n!\). Therefore, the product of the first 5000 odd numbers is \(5000!\).
  To account for the fact that the product is taken over the range from 1 to 9999, we need to divide this product by the number of ways to choose 5000 numbers out of 9999, which is \(2^{5000}\). Thus, the product of all positive odd integers less than 10000 is:
  \[
  \dfrac{5000!}{2^{5000}}
  \]
  Finally, we need to account for the fact that the product is taken over the range from 1 to 9999, and the correct form is:
  \[
  \dfrac{10000!}{2^{5000} \cdot 5000!}
  \]
