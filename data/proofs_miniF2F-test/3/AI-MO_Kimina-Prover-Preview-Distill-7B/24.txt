-- We want to compute the product of all positive odd integers less than 10000.
  -- We can write this as $\prod_{\substack{1 \leq n < 10000 \\ n \text{ odd}}} n$.
  -- Notice that $10000! = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot... \cdot 9999$.
  -- So the product of all positive odd integers less than 10000 is $\frac{10000!}{2 \cdot 4 \cdot 6 \cdot... \cdot 10000}$.
  -- Notice that $2 \cdot 4 \cdot 6 \cdot... \cdot 10000 = 2^{5000} \cdot 5000!$.
  -- So the product of all positive odd integers less than 10000 is $\frac{10000!}{2^{5000} \cdot 5000!}$.
  -- This is answer choice (D).

  -- The `?_` here is a pure computation problem. It can be solved either directly,
  -- either by computing the required product, or by computing the ratio of the product
  -- of all odd numbers to the product of all even numbers in the range.
