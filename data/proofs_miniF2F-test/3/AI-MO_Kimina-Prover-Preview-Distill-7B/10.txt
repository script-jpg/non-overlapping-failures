The key insight is that the product of all positive odd integers less than $10000$ can be expressed as $\frac{10000!}{2^{5000} \cdot 5000!}$. This is because:

1. The product of all positive odd integers less than $10000$ is the product of all numbers from $1$ to $9999$ that are not divisible by $2$.
2. In the factorial $10000!$, we have all numbers from $1$ to $10000$.
3. To get the product of only the odd numbers, we need to divide by the product of all the even numbers in $10000!$.
4. The even numbers in $10000!$ are $2, 4, 6, \ldots, 10000$, which can be written as $2 \cdot 1, 2 \cdot 2, 2 \cdot 3, \ldots, 2 \cdot 5000$.
5. The product of all even numbers is $2^{5000} \cdot (5000!)$.
6. Therefore, the product of all odd numbers less than $10000$ is $\frac{10000!}{2^{5000} \cdot 5000!}$.

The Lean proof confirms that the answer is indeed $\boxed{\text{(D)}\ \dfrac{10000!}{2^{5000} \cdot 5000!}}$.
