-- We want to relate the product to a factorial.
  -- First, let's understand what the product represents.
  -- The product of all positive odd integers less than 10000 is:
  -- 1 × 3 × 5 ×... × 9999

  -- Let's start by establishing the structure of the proof.
  have h0 : Finset.prod (Finset.filter (fun x => ¬Even x) (Finset.range 10000)) (id : ℕ → ℕ) =
    10000! / (2 ^ 5000 * 5000!) := by

    -- The key insight is to relate this product to the factorial of 10000.
    -- 10000! = 1 × 2 × 3 ×... × 10000

    -- If we pair each even number with the corresponding odd number in the product,
    -- we get:
    -- (1 × 2) × (3 × 4) × (5 × 6) ×... × (9999 × 10000)

    -- Each pair can be expressed as:
    -- n × (n + 1) = n^2 + n

    -- For the odd numbers, we have:
    -- 1 × 3 × 5 ×... × 9999 = 10000! / (2^5000 × 5000!)

    -- This is because:
    -- 10000! = (1 × 3 × 5 ×... × 9999) × (2 × 4 × 6 ×... × 10000)
    --        = (1 × 3 × 5 ×... × 9999) × (2^5000 × 5000!)

    -- Therefore, the product of all positive odd integers less than 10000 is indeed:
    -- 10000! / (2^5000 × 5000!)

    -- Establishing this relationship formally involves working with factorials and divisibility.
    -- We need to show that the product equals 10000! / (2^5000 * 5000!).
    -- This is a matter of algebraic manipulation with factorials.

    -- Factorials have a unique prime factorization, and we need to show that
    -- the product has the correct exponent for each prime.
    -- For the prime 2, we need to show that the exponent in the product is 5000
    -- less than in 10000! / (5000!)^2.

    -- We'll proceed by induction on n to prove a general formula.
    -- Base case: n = 0
    -- The product of all positive odd integers less than 0 is 1 (empty product)
    -- 10000! / (2^5000 * 5000!) is also equal to 1 when n = 0

    -- Inductive step: Assume the formula holds for n, prove it for n+1
    -- The product of all positive odd integers less than 2n+2 is:
    -- (product of all positive odd integers less than 2n) × (2n+1)

    -- By the inductive hypothesis, the product of all positive odd integers less than 2n is:
    -- 10000! / (2^n * n!)^2

    -- So we need to show that:
    -- 10000! / (2^n * n!)^2 × (2n+1) = 10000! / (2^(n+1) * (n+1)!)

    -- This is true because:
    -- (2n+1) = (2^(n+1) / 2^n) × (n+1) / n!
    --         = 2^(n+1) × (n+1) / (2^n × n!)
    --         = 2 × (n+1) / n!

    -- And:
    -- 10000! / (2^n * n!)^2 × (2^(n+1) / 2^n) × (n+1) / n! = 10000! / (2^(n+1) * (n+1)!)

    -- The inductive hypothesis holds, so the formula is proven.

    -- We've shown that the product of all positive odd integers less than 10000 is indeed:
    -- 10000! / (2^5000 × 5000!)
