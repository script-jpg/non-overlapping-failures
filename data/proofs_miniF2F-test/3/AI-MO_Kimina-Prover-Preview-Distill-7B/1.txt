  -- We will compute the product ∏_{k=1}^{4999} (2k+1) in a different way.
  -- First, we note that ∏_{k=1}^{4999} (2k+1) = (1·3·5·...·9999)
  -- We can pair each term (2k+1) with (10000-2k-1) = 9999-2k
  -- Thus, the product can be grouped as (1·9999)·(3·9997)·(5·9995)·...·(4999·5001)
  -- Each pair (2k+1)·(9999-2k) = 9999-4k²
  -- The product then becomes ∏_{k=0}^{4999} (9999-4k²)

    -- We compute the sum ∑_{k=0}^{4999} (2k+1) = 10000!
    -- We know that ∑_{k=0}^{n-1} (2k+1) = n²
    -- Thus, ∑_{k=0}^{4999} (2k+1) = 5000² = 25000000
    -- But we need to compute 10000! / (2^5000 * 5000!)
    -- Let's think about how to compute this...
    -- We know that 10000! = 1·2·3·4·...·10000
    -- And 2^5000·5000! = 2^5000·1·2·3·4·...·5000
    -- So 10000! / (2^5000·5000!) = (1·2·3·4·...·10000) / (2^5000·1·2·3·4·...·5000)
    -- We can cancel the 1·2·3·4·...·5000 in the numerator and denominator
    -- So we have (5001·5002·...·10000) / 2^5000
    -- This is exactly the value of our product
    -- We need to compute this in Lean...
