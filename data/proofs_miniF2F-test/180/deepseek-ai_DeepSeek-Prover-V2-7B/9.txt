    Given the equations:
    1. \( a + 6d = 30 \)
    2. \( a + 10d = 60 \)
    
    We can solve for \( a \) and \( d \) step by step.
    
    First, subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2 to eliminate \( a \):
    \[ (a + 10d) - (a + 6d) = 60 - 30 \]
    \[ 4d = 30 \]
    \[ d = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]
    
    Next, substitute \( d = 7.5 \) back into Equation 1 to find \( a \):
    \[ a + 6 \times 7.5 = 30 \]
    \[ a + 45 = 30 \]
    \[ a = 30 - 45 \]
    \[ a = -15 \]
    
    Finally, calculate the 21st term \( a + 20d \):
    \[ a + 20d = -15 + 20 \times 7.5 \]
    \[ = -15 + 150 \]
    \[ = 135 \]
