have h₂ : a + 20 * d = 135 := by
    -- We need to find the 21st term, which is a + 20d.
    -- Using the given terms, we can set up the following equations:
    -- a + 6d = 30 (1)
    -- a + 10d = 60 (2)
    -- Subtract (1) from (2) to find 4d:
    -- a + 10d - (a + 6d) = 60 - 30
    -- 4d = 30
    -- d = 7.5
    -- Substitute d = 7.5 into (1) to find a:
    -- a + 6 * 7.5 = 30
    -- a + 45 = 30
    -- a = -15
    -- Now, calculate the 21st term:
    -- a + 20d = -15 + 20 * 7.5 = -15 + 150 = 135
