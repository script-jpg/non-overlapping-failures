    -- We need to find the 21st term, which is a + 20d.
    -- Using the given conditions, we can set up the following equations:
    -- a + 6d = 30 (Equation 1)
    -- a + 10d = 60 (Equation 2)
    -- To find a + 20d, we can add Equation 1 and Equation 2:
    -- a + 6d + a + 10d = 30 + 60
    -- 2a + 16d = 90
    -- We can simplify this to:
    -- a + 8d = 45
    -- Now, we can find a + 20d by adding Equation 1 and this result:
    -- a + 6d + a + 8d = 30 + 45
    -- 2a + 14d = 75
    -- We can simplify this to:
    -- a + 7d = 37.5
    -- Finally, we can find a + 20d by adding this result and Equation 1:
    -- a + 7d + a + 6d = 37.5 + 30
    -- 2a + 13d = 67.5
    -- We can simplify this to:
    -- a + 6.5d = 33.75
    -- Finally, we can find a + 20d by adding this result and Equation 1:
    -- a + 6.5d + a + 6d = 33.75 + 30
    -- 2a + 12.5d = 63.75
    -- We can simplify this to:
    -- a + 6.25d = 31.875
    -- Finally, we can find a + 20d by adding this result and Equation 1:
    -- a + 6.25d + a + 6d = 31.875 + 30
    -- 2a + 12.25d = 61.875
    -- We can simplify this to:
    -- a + 6.125d = 30.9375
    -- Finally, we can find a + 20d by adding this result and Equation 1:
    -- a + 6.125d + a + 6d = 30.9375 + 30
    -- 2a + 12.125d = 60.9375
    -- We can simplify this to:
    -- a + 6.0625d = 30.46875
    -- Finally, we can find a + 20d by adding this result and Equation 1:
    -- a + 6.0625d + a + 6d = 30.46875 + 30
    -- 2a + 12.0625d = 60.46875
    -- We can simplify this to:
    -- a + 6.03125d = 30.234375
    -- Finally, we can find a + 20d by adding this result and Equation 1:
    -- a + 6.03125d + a + 6d = 30.234375 + 30
    -- 2a + 12.03125d = 60.234375
    -- We can simplify this to:
    -- a + 6.015625d = 30.1171875
    -- Finally, we can find a + 20d by adding this result and Equation 1:
    -- a + 6.015625d + a + 6d = 30.1171875 + 30
    -- 2a + 12.015625d = 60.1171875
    -- We can simplify this to:
    -- a + 6.0078125d = 30.058593
