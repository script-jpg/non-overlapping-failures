  Given an arithmetic sequence where the 7th term is 30 and the 11th term is 60, we need to determine the 21st term of this sequence. We are given the equations:
  \[ a + 6d = 30 \]
  \[ a + 10d = 60 \]
  To find the 21st term, we need to express \( a + 20d \) in terms of the given equations. We can use the fact that the difference between the 11th and 7th terms is \( 4d \), and the difference between the 11th and 21st terms is \( 10d \).
  First, solve the system of equations to find the common difference \( d \) and the first term \( a \). Subtract the first equation from the second:
  \[ (a + 10d) - (a + 6d) = 60 - 30 \]
  \[ 4d = 30 \]
  \[ d = \frac{30}{4} = \frac{15}{2} \]
  Substitute \( d = \frac{15}{2} \) back into the first equation to find \( a \):
  \[ a + 6 \left( \frac{15}{2} \right) = 30 \]
  \[ a + 45 = 30 \]
  \[ a = 30 - 45 \]
  \[ a = -15 \]
  Now, substitute \( a = -15 \) and \( d = \frac{15}{2} \) into the expression for the 21st term:
  \[ a + 20d = -15 + 20 \left( \frac{15}{2} \right) \]
  \[ a + 20d = -15 + 150 \]
  \[ a + 20d = 135 \]
  Thus, the 21st term of the sequence is \( 135 \).
