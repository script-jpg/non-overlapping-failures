  Given an arithmetic sequence with the first term \( a \) and common difference \( d \), we know that the 7th term is 30 and the 11th term is 60. We need to find the 21st term of this sequence, which is given to be 135.
  First, we express the 7th and 11th terms using the arithmetic sequence formula:
  \[ a + 6d = 30 \]
  \[ a + 10d = 60 \]
  To find the common difference \( d \), we subtract the first equation from the second:
  \[ (a + 10d) - (a + 6d) = 60 - 30 \]
  \[ 4d = 30 \]
  \[ d = 7.5 \]
  Next, we substitute \( d \) back into the first equation to find \( a \):
  \[ a + 6 \times 7.5 = 30 \]
  \[ a + 45 = 30 \]
  \[ a = -15 \]
  Now, we calculate the 21st term using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence:
  \[ a + 20d = -15 + 20 \times 7.5 \]
  \[ a + 20d = -15 + 150 \]
  \[ a + 20d = 135 \]
  Thus, the 21st term of the sequence is indeed 135.
