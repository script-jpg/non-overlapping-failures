  Given an arithmetic sequence with the first term \(a\) and common difference \(d\), we are provided with the following conditions:
  - The 7th term is 30, implying \(a + 6d = 30\).
  - The 11th term is 60, implying \(a + 10d = 60\).
  We need to determine the 21st term of this sequence, which is given by \(a + 20d\).
  First, we solve for \(d\) by subtracting the equation for the 7th term from the equation for the 11th term:
  \[
  (a + 10d) - (a + 6d) = 60 - 30
  \]
  Simplifying this, we get:
  \[
  4d = 30 \implies d = 7.5
  \]
  Next, we substitute \(d = 7.5\) back into the equation for the 7th term to solve for \(a\):
  \[
  a + 6 \times 7.5 = 30 \implies a + 45 = 30 \implies a = -15
  \]
  Now, we calculate the 21st term of the sequence:
  \[
  a + 20d = -15 + 20 \times 7.5 = -15 + 150 = 135
  \]
  Thus, the 21st term of the sequence is 135.
