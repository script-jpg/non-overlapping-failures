  Given an arithmetic sequence with the first term \( a \) and common difference \( d \), we know that the 7th term is 30 and the 11th term is 60. We need to find the 21st term of this sequence, which is given to be 135.
  From the given information, we have the equations:
  \[ a + 6d = 30 \]
  \[ a + 10d = 60 \]
  To find the 21st term, we need to determine \( a + 20d \). We can use the given equations to solve for \( a \) and \( d \).
  First, subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( a \):
  \[ (a + 10d) - (a + 6d) = 60 - 30 \]
  \[ 4d = 30 \]
  \[ d = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]
  Next, substitute \( d = 7.5 \) back into the first equation to find \( a \):
  \[ a + 6 \times 7.5 = 30 \]
  \[ a + 45 = 30 \]
  \[ a = 30 - 45 = -15 \]
  Now, we can find the 21st term by adding 20 times the common difference to the first term:
  \[ a + 20d = -15 + 20 \times 7.5 = -15 + 150 = 135 \]
  Thus, the 21st term of the sequence is indeed 135.
