  Given an arithmetic sequence, we know that the 7th term is 30 and the 11th term is 60. We need to find the 21st term of this sequence and show that it is 135.
  First, we express the 7th and 11th terms in terms of the first term \(a\) and the common difference \(d\):
  - The 7th term is \(a + 6d = 30\).
  - The 11th term is \(a + 10d = 60\).
  To find the 21st term, we need to determine \(a + 20d\). We can use the equations to solve for \(a\) and \(d\).
  Subtract the equation for the 7th term from the equation for the 11th term:
  \[
  (a + 10d) - (a + 6d) = 60 - 30
  \]
  \[
  4d = 30
  \]
  \[
  d = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5
  \]
  Substitute \(d = 7.5\) back into the equation for the 7th term:
  \[
  a + 6 \cdot 7.5 = 30
  \]
  \[
  a + 45 = 30
  \]
  \[
  a = 30 - 45 = -15
  \]
  Now, calculate the 21st term:
  \[
  a + 20d = -15 + 20 \cdot 7.5 = -15 + 150 = 135
  \]
  Thus, the 21st term of the sequence is 135.

  -- Subtract the equation for the 7th term from the equation for the 11th term to solve for d.
  have h₂ : d = (30 - a) / 6 := by linarith
  -- Substitute d back into the equation for the 7th term to solve for a.
  have h₃ : a = 15 := by linarith
  -- Calculate the 21st term using the values of a and d.
  have h₄ : a + 20 * d = 135 := by linarith
  -- The final result matches the expected value.
