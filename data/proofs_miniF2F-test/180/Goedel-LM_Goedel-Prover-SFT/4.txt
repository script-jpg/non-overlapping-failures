  Given an arithmetic sequence with the 7th term equal to 30 and the 11th term equal to 60, we need to determine the 21st term of this sequence. We are provided with the equations:
  \[ a + 6d = 30 \]
  \[ a + 10d = 60 \]
  First, we solve for the common difference \( d \) by subtracting the first equation from the second:
  \[ (a + 10d) - (a + 6d) = 60 - 30 \]
  \[ 4d = 30 \]
  \[ d = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]
  Next, we substitute \( d = 7.5 \) back into the first equation to solve for \( a \):
  \[ a + 6 \times 7.5 = 30 \]
  \[ a + 45 = 30 \]
  \[ a = 30 - 45 \]
  \[ a = -15 \]
  Finally, we calculate the 21st term of the sequence:
  \[ a + 20d = -15 + 20 \times 7.5 \]
  \[ a + 20d = -15 + 150 \]
  \[ a + 20d = 135 \]
