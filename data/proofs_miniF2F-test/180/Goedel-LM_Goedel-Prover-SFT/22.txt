  Given an arithmetic sequence with the 7th term equal to 30 and the 11th term equal to 60, we need to determine the 21st term of this sequence. The general form of the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by \(a + (n-1)d\), where \(a\) is the first term and \(d\) is the common difference.
  From the given conditions:
  \[ a + 6d = 30 \]
  \[ a + 10d = 60 \]
  We can solve for \(a\) and \(d\) by subtracting the first equation from the second:
  \[ (a + 10d) - (a + 6d) = 60 - 30 \]
  \[ 4d = 30 \]
  \[ d = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]
  Substituting \(d = 7.5\) back into the first equation:
  \[ a + 6 \cdot 7.5 = 30 \]
  \[ a + 45 = 30 \]
  \[ a = 30 - 45 = -15 \]
  Now, we need to find the 21st term:
  \[ a + 20d = -15 + 20 \cdot 7.5 \]
  \[ a + 20d = -15 + 150 \]
  \[ a + 20d = 135 \]
  Thus, the 21st term of the sequence is 135.
