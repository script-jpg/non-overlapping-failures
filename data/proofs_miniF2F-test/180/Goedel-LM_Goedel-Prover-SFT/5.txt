  Given an arithmetic sequence where the 7th term is 30 and the 11th term is 60, we need to determine the 21st term of this sequence. We start with the equations:
  \[ a + 6d = 30 \]
  \[ a + 10d = 60 \]
  First, we solve for the common difference \( d \) by subtracting the first equation from the second:
  \[ (a + 10d) - (a + 6d) = 60 - 30 \]
  \[ 4d = 30 \]
  \[ d = 7.5 \]
  Next, we substitute \( d = 7.5 \) back into the first equation to solve for \( a \):
  \[ a + 6 \cdot 7.5 = 30 \]
  \[ a + 45 = 30 \]
  \[ a = -15 \]
  Now, we calculate the 21st term of the sequence:
  \[ a + 20d = -15 + 20 \cdot 7.5 \]
  \[ a + 20d = -15 + 150 \]
  \[ a + 20d = 135 \]
  Thus, the 21st term of the sequence is \( 135 \).
