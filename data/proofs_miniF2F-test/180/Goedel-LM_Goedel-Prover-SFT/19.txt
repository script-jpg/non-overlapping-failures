  Given an arithmetic sequence with the 7th term equal to 30 and the 11th term equal to 60, we need to determine the 21st term of this sequence. The general form of the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by \(a + (n-1)d\), where \(a\) is the first term and \(d\) is the common difference.
  From the given information:
  - The 7th term is \(a + 6d = 30\).
  - The 11th term is \(a + 10d = 60\).
  We can solve for \(a\) and \(d\) using these equations. Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:
  \[ (a + 10d) - (a + 6d) = 60 - 30 \]
  \[ 4d = 30 \]
  \[ d = 7.5 \]
  Substituting \(d = 7.5\) back into the first equation:
  \[ a + 6 \times 7.5 = 30 \]
  \[ a + 45 = 30 \]
  \[ a = -15 \]
  Now, to find the 21st term:
  \[ a + 20d = -15 + 20 \times 7.5 \]
  \[ a + 20d = -15 + 150 \]
  \[ a + 20d = 135 \]
  Thus, the 21st term of the sequence is \(135\).
