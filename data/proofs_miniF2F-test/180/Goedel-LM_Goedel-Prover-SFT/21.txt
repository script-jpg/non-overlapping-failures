  Given an arithmetic sequence with the first term \(a\) and common difference \(d\), we know that the 7th term is 30 and the 11th term is 60. We need to find the 21st term of this sequence, which is given as 135.
  1. From the given information, we have the equations:
     \[
     a + 6d = 30 \quad \text{(1)}
     \]
     \[
     a + 10d = 60 \quad \text{(2)}
     \]
  2. Subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate \(a\):
     \[
     (a + 10d) - (a + 6d) = 60 - 30
     \]
     \[
     4d = 30
     \]
     \[
     d = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5
     \]
  3. Substitute \(d = 7.5\) back into equation (1) to find \(a\):
     \[
     a + 6 \times 7.5 = 30
     \]
     \[
     a + 45 = 30
     \]
     \[
     a = 30 - 45 = -15
     \]
  4. Now, calculate the 21st term of the sequence:
     \[
     a + 20d = -15 + 20 \times 7.5
     \]
     \[
     a + 20d = -15 + 150
     \]
     \[
     a + 20d = 135
     \]
  Thus, the 21st term of the sequence is indeed 135.
