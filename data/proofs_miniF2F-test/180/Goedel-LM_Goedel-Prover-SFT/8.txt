  Given an arithmetic sequence with the 7th term equal to 30 and the 11th term equal to 60, we need to determine the 21st term. We start by using the properties of arithmetic sequences, which are given by the equations:
  \[ a + 6d = 30 \]
  \[ a + 10d = 60 \]
  We can solve for \( a \) and \( d \) using these equations. Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:
  \[ (a + 10d) - (a + 6d) = 60 - 30 \]
  \[ 4d = 30 \]
  \[ d = 7.5 \]
  Substituting \( d = 7.5 \) back into the first equation:
  \[ a + 6 \times 7.5 = 30 \]
  \[ a + 45 = 30 \]
  \[ a = -15 \]
  Now, we need to find the 21st term of the sequence, which is given by:
  \[ a + 20d \]
  Substituting \( a = -15 \) and \( d = 7.5 \):
  \[ -15 + 20 \times 7.5 = -15 + 150 = 135 \]
  Thus, the 21st term is \( 135 \).
