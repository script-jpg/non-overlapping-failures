  Given an arithmetic sequence with the 7th term equal to 30 and the 11th term equal to 60, we need to determine the 21st term of this sequence. We start by expressing the 7th and 11th terms using the formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence, which is \(a + (n-1)d\), where \(a\) is the first term and \(d\) is the common difference.
  From the given information, we have:
  \[ a + 6d = 30 \]
  \[ a + 10d = 60 \]
  To find the 21st term, we need to determine \(a\) and \(d\). We can solve the system of equations to find \(a\) and \(d\).
  First, subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \(a\):
  \[ (a + 10d) - (a + 6d) = 60 - 30 \]
  \[ 4d = 30 \]
  \[ d = \frac{30}{4} = \frac{15}{2} \]
  Next, substitute \(d = \frac{15}{2}\) back into the first equation to solve for \(a\):
  \[ a + 6 \left(\frac{15}{2}\right) = 30 \]
  \[ a + 45 = 30 \]
  \[ a = 30 - 45 = -15 \]
  Now, substitute \(a = -15\) and \(d = \frac{15}{2}\) into the expression for the 21st term:
  \[ a + 20d = -15 + 20 \left(\frac{15}{2}\right) \]
  \[ = -15 + 150 \]
  \[ = 135 \]
  Thus, the 21st term of the sequence is \(135\).

  -- We need to solve the system of equations to find the first term `a` and the common difference `d`.
  have h₂ : a + 6 * d = 30 := by linarith
  have h₃ : a + 10 * d = 60 := by linarith
  -- Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate `a` and solve for `d`.
  have h₄ : 4 * d = 30 := by linarith
  -- Solve for `d`.
  have h₅ : d = 15 / 2 := by linarith
  -- Substitute `d` back into the first equation to solve for `a`.
  have h₆ : a = -15 := by linarith
  -- Substitute `a` and `d` into the expression for the 21st term.
  have h₇ : a + 20 * d = 135 := by linarith
  -- The final result is `135`.
