-- We know that in an arithmetic sequence, the $n$th term is given by $a + (n-1)d$, where $a$ is the first term and $d$ is the common difference.
  -- We are given that the 7th term is 30, so $a + 6d = 30$.
  -- We are also given that the 11th term is 60, so $a + 10d = 60$.
  -- We need to find the 21st term, which is $a + 20d$.

  -- Let's start by finding the common difference $d$.
  -- Subtract the equation for the 7th term from the equation for the 11th term:
  -- $(a + 10d) - (a + 6d) = 60 - 30$
  -- $4d = 30$
  -- So $d = 30 / 4 = 7.5$.

  have hd : d = 30 / 4 := by
    linarith

  -- Now that we have $d = 7.5$, we can substitute it back into the equation for the 7th term to find $a$.
  -- $a + 6 \cdot 7.5 = 30$
  -- $a + 45 = 30$
  -- $a = 30 - 45 = -15$

  have ha : a = -15 := by
    linarith [h₀, hd]

  -- Finally, we can find the 21st term:
  -- $a + 20d = -15 + 20 \cdot 7.5 = -15 + 150 = 135$
