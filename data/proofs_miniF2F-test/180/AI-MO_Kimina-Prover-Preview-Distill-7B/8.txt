The theorem statement represents an arithmetic sequence where the 7th term is $a + 6d = 30$ and the 11th term is $a + 10d = 60$. We need to prove that the 21st term, $a + 20d$, equals 135.

Let's analyze the problem algebraically before formalizing the solution. We have:
- $a + 6d = 30$ (equation 1)
- $a + 10d = 60$ (equation 2)

Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2:
$(a + 10d) - (a + 6d) = 60 - 30$
$4d = 30$
$d = 7.5$

Substituting $d = 7.5$ back into equation 1:
$a + 6 \cdot 7.5 = 30$
$a + 45 = 30$
$a = 30 - 45 = -15$

Now, we can find the 21st term:
$a + 20d = -15 + 20 \cdot 7.5 = -15 + 150 = 135$

The Lean proof is remarkably concise because Lean's `linarith` tactic is powerful enough to solve systems of linear arithmetic goals. It automatically handles the steps we did manually: subtracting equations to find $d$, substituting back to find $a$, and computing the value of the 21st term.

So the complete Lean 4 proof is:

Now we'll define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_354 (a d : ℝ) (h₀ : a + 6 * d = 30) (h₁ : a + 10 * d = 60) :
    a + 20 * d = 135 := by
  linarith
```

This Lean proof is elegant in its simplicity. The `linarith` tactic is powerful enough to solve systems of linear equations and inequalities. It takes the two hypotheses `h₀` and `h₁` as inputs, which represent our two equations, and automatically proves that `a + 20 * d = 135` is a logical consequence of these equations.

In conclusion, the 21st term of the arithmetic sequence is 135, as shown by both the manual algebraic calculation and the Lean 4 proof.
