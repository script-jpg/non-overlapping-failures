-- prove by eliminating $a$, $d$

  have h : a + 20 * d = 135 := by

    linarith only [h₀, h₁]

  exact h
```

The Lean proof is remarkably concise. Let me explain why this works. In an arithmetic sequence, each term is defined as $a_n = a + (n-1)d$ where $a$ is the first term, $d$ is the common difference, and $n$ is the term number.

Given that the 7th term is 30, we have:
- $a_7 = a + 6d = 30$ (since $n-1 = 7-1 = 6$)

Similarly, given that the 11th term is 60, we have:
- $a_{11} = a + 10d = 60$ (since $n-1 = 11-1 = 10$)

We need to find the 21st term:
- $a_{21} = a + 20d$ (since $n-1 = 21-1 = 20$)

The Lean proof declares variables $a$ and $d$ as real numbers and includes hypotheses h₀ and h₁ representing our given conditions. The goal is to prove that $a + 20d = 135$.

The Lean proof uses `linarith` with our two hypotheses:
```tactics
linarith only [h₀, h₁]
```

This tactic is powerful for solving linear arithmetic problems. It will:
1. Take the equations $a + 6d = 30$ and $a + 10d = 60$
2. Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate $a$: $(a + 10d) - (a + 6d) = 60 - 30$
3. Simplify to get $4d = 30$, so $d = 7.5$
4. Substitute $d = 7.5$ back into $a + 6d = 30$ to solve for $a$: $a + 6(7.5) = 30$
5. Simplify to get $a + 45 = 30$, so $a = -15$
6. Now compute $a + 20d = -15 + 20(7.5) = -15 + 150 = 135$

The Lean proof automatically handles these calculations because `linarith` is designed to solve systems of linear equations and inequalities. It can deduce that $a + 20d = 135$ directly from our two hypotheses without requiring us to manually solve for $a$ and $d$.

Therefore, the 21st term of the sequence is 135.
