The theorem statement represents an arithmetic sequence where the 7th term is 30 (a + 6d = 30) and the 11th term is 60 (a + 10d = 60). We need to find the 21st term (a + 20d).

To solve this, we can first find the common difference, d, by subtracting the equation for the 7th term from the equation for the 11th term:
(a + 10d) - (a + 6d) = 60 - 30
4d = 30
d = 30 / 4 = 15/2

Now that we have d = 15/2, we can substitute it back into the equation for the 7th term to find a:
a + 6(15/2) = 30
a + 45 = 30
a = 30 - 45 = -15/2

Now, we can find the 21st term:
a + 20d = -15/2 + 20(15/2) = -15/2 + 150 = -15/2 + 300/2 = 285/2 = 142.5

Wait, let me recalculate that correctly. I made an error in the calculation.

a + 20d = -15/2 + 20(15/2) = -15/2 + 300/2 = 285/2 = 142.5

Wait, let me double-check the algebra.

From the two equations:
1. a + 6d = 30
2. a + 10d = 60

Subtracting the first from the second gives:
4d = 30
d = 30/4 = 15/2

Substituting d = 15/2 into the first equation:
a + 6(15/2) = 30
a + 45 = 30
a = 30 - 45 = -15

Now, the 21st term is:
a + 20d = -15 + 20(15/2) = -15 + 150 = 135

Yes, that's correct. The 21st term is 135.

In Lean, we can solve this directly using the linarith tactic, which is powerful enough to solve linear arithmetic goals directly from the given equations without explicitly solving for a and d:

Now, we'll define the theorem with the given conditions and goal:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_354 (a d : ℝ) (h₀ : a + 6 * d = 30) (h₁ : a + 10 * d = 60) :
    a + 20 * d = 135 := by
```

We have two equations:
1. a + 6d = 30 (h₀)
2. a + 10d = 60 (h₁)

We need to prove that a + 20d = 135

Let's solve this directly using linear arithmetic:

Subtracting the first equation from the second:
(a + 10d) - (a + 6d) = 60 - 30
4d = 30
d = 30/4 = 15/2

Now, substituting d = 15/2 into the first equation to find a:
a + 6(15/2) = 30
a + 45 = 30
a = 30 - 45 = -15

Now, computing the 21st term:
a + 20d = -15 + 20(15/2) = -15 + 150 = 135

In Lean, we can solve this directly using linarith:

```tactics
linarith
```

The linarith tactic is able to solve goals involving linear arithmetic facts. It can take the two given equations h₀ and h₁, and derive that a + 20 * d = 135 directly without needing to explicitly solve for a and d. It works by combining the equations to eliminate variables and derive the goal. In this case, it would effectively perform the same steps we did manually: subtract the equations to find d, then substitute back to find a, and then compute a + 20d. However, Lean's automation can do this directly from the given constraints.

Therefore, the complete proof is remarkably concise because Lean's linarith tactic is powerful enough to handle this system of linear equations directly. This demonstrates how powerful automated reasoning can be for solving arithmetic problems that would typically require several steps of manual calculation.
