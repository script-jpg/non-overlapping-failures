  Given the equations:
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  x_1 + 4x_2 + 9x_3 + 16x_4 + 25x_5 + 36x_6 + 49x_7 &= 1, \\
  4x_1 + 9x_2 + 16x_3 + 25x_4 + 36x_5 + 49x_6 + 64x_7 &= 12, \\
  9x_1 + 16x_2 + 25x_3 + 36x_4 + 49x_5 + 64x_6 + 81x_7 &= 123,
  \end{align*}
  \]
  we need to find the value of \(16x_1 + 25x_2 + 36x_3 + 49x_4 + 64x_5 + 81x_6 + 100x_7\) and show that it equals 334.
  To achieve this, we can use the given equations and perform linear combinations to derive the desired result. Specifically, we will use the `linarith` tactic, which is capable of handling linear equations and can derive the final value by leveraging the given equations.
