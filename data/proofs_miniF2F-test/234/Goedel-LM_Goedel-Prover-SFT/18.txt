  Given the equations involving real numbers \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_7 \):
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  x_1 + 4x_2 + 9x_3 + 16x_4 + 25x_5 + 36x_6 + 49x_7 &= 1, \\
  4x_1 + 9x_2 + 16x_3 + 25x_4 + 36x_5 + 49x_6 + 64x_7 &= 12, \\
  9x_1 + 16x_2 + 25x_3 + 36x_4 + 49x_5 + 64x_6 + 81x_7 &= 123,
  \end{align*}
  \]
  we need to find the value of \( 16x_1 + 25x_2 + 36x_3 + 49x_4 + 64x_5 + 81x_6 + 100x_7 \).
  By examining the structure of the equations, we can observe that each equation is a quadratic equation in terms of \( x_i \). We can use the given equations to derive the value of the target expression by leveraging the properties of the coefficients and the given sums.
