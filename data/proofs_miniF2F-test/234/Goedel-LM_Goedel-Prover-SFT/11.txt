  Given real numbers \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_7 \) such that:
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  x_1 + 4x_2 + 9x_3 + 16x_4 + 25x_5 + 36x_6 + 49x_7 &= 1, \\
  4x_1 + 9x_2 + 16x_3 + 25x_4 + 36x_5 + 49x_6 + 64x_7 &= 12, \\
  9x_1 + 16x_2 + 25x_3 + 36x_4 + 49x_5 + 64x_6 + 81x_7 &= 123.
  \end{align*}
  \]
  We need to find the value of \( 16x_1 + 25x_2 + 36x_3 + 49x_4 + 64x_5 + 81x_6 + 100x_7 \).
  By examining the given equations, we can observe that the coefficients of \( x_i \) follow a pattern where the coefficient of \( x_i \) is \( (i+1)^2 \). Therefore, the value of the expression \( 16x_1 + 25x_2 + 36x_3 + 49x_4 + 64x_5 + 81x_6 + 100x_7 \) can be determined by scaling the sum of the coefficients by the appropriate factor.
  Given the constraints, we can use the fact that the sum of the coefficients is 1, and thus the value of the expression is 334.
