  Given the equations:
  1. \( x_1 + 4x_2 + 9x_3 + 16x_4 + 25x_5 + 36x_6 + 49x_7 = 1 \)
  2. \( 4x_1 + 9x_2 + 16x_3 + 25x_4 + 36x_5 + 49x_6 + 64x_7 = 12 \)
  3. \( 9x_1 + 16x_2 + 25x_3 + 36x_4 + 49x_5 + 64x_6 + 81x_7 = 123 \)
  We need to find the value of \( 16x_1 + 25x_2 + 36x_3 + 49x_4 + 64x_5 + 81x_6 + 100x_7 \).
  To solve this, we can use the given equations to express each variable in terms of the others. By solving the system of equations, we can derive the value of the target expression.
