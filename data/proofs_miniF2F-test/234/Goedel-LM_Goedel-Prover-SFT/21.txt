  Given the equations involving real numbers \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_7 \):
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  x_1 + 4x_2 + 9x_3 + 16x_4 + 25x_5 + 36x_6 + 49x_7 &= 1, \\
  4x_1 + 9x_2 + 16x_3 + 25x_4 + 36x_5 + 49x_6 + 64x_7 &= 12, \\
  9x_1 + 16x_2 + 25x_3 + 36x_4 + 49x_5 + 64x_6 + 81x_7 &= 123.
  \end{align*}
  \]
  We need to find the value of \( 16x_1 + 25x_2 + 36x_3 + 49x_4 + 64x_5 + 81x_6 + 100x_7 \).
  By examining the structure of the equations, we can observe that each equation has a specific form where the coefficients of \( x_i \) are squares of consecutive integers. We can use the given equations to derive the desired result by leveraging the properties of the coefficients and the sums of the squares of integers.
