-- First, I notice that the coefficients of the equations have a pattern. Each equation has coefficients that are perfect squares, specifically $(n^2, (n+1)^2, (n+2)^2, \ldots, (n+6)^2)$ for $n = 1, 2, 3$ in the first three equations. Let's think about how to exploit this structure.

  -- One approach would be to directly solve this system of equations to find the values of $a, b, c, d, e, f, g$, and then compute the desired expression. However, this would involve tedious manual computation, and Lean's automation might be powerful enough to solve it directly.

  -- Let me try a more elegant approach. Notice that if we treat the equations as a linear system, we can represent the problem as a matrix multiplication. The goal is to compute a specific linear combination of the variables.

  -- Let's consider using Lean's computational capabilities to solve this system. We have:
  have h₃ : 16 * a + 25 * b + 36 * c + 49 * d + 64 * e + 81 * f + 100 * g = 334 := by
    linarith
  exact h₃
