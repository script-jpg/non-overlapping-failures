-- difference of 2nd and 1st equation: 3*(a + b + c + d + e + f + g) + 15 = 11
  have eq1 : 3 * (a + b + c + d + e + f + g) + 15 = 11 := by linarith

  -- difference of 3rd and 2nd equation: 3*(a + b + c + d + e + f + g) + 30 = 111
  have eq2 : 3 * (a + b + c + d + e + f + g) + 30 = 111 := by linarith

  -- difference of eq2 and eq1: 15 = 100

  -- difference of eq3 and eq1: 15 - 11 = 100 - 11
