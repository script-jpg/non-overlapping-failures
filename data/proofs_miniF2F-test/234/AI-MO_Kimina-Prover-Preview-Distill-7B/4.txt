-- We can write the problem in matrix form as follows:
  -- $A * x = y$, where $A$ is a 3x7 matrix, $x$ is a 7x1 vector, and $y$ is a 3x1 vector.
  -- $$A = \begin{bmatrix}
  --  1 &  4 &  9 & 16 & 25 & 36 & 49 \\
  --  4 &  9 & 16 & 25 & 36 & 49 & 64 \\
  --  9 & 16 & 25 & 36 & 49 & 64 & 81 \\
  -- \end{bmatrix}$$
  -- $$x = \begin{bmatrix}
  --  a \\ b \\ c \\ d \\ e \\ f \\ g
  -- \end{bmatrix} \quad
  --  y = \begin{bmatrix}
  --  1 \\ 12 \\ 123
  -- \end{bmatrix}$$
  -- To find the value of $16x_1+25x_2+36x_3+49x_4+64x_5+81x_6+100x_7$, we can treat it as another dot product
  -- $16x_1+25x_2+36x_3+49x_4+64x_5+81x_6+100x_7 = [16 25 36 49 64 81 100] * x$
  -- We need to find a way to compute this dot product given the previous equations.

  -- We could try to solve the system of equations to find the values of $a,b,c,d,e,f,g$,
  -- but the system is likely overdetermined (we have 7 variables and only 3 equations).
  -- Instead, we can try to find a pattern or relationship to compute the desired value.

  -- Let's consider the values $1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49$ as coefficients of the equations.
  -- They are perfect squares! Similarly, the target $16x_1+25x_2+36x_3+49x_4+64x_5+81x_6+100x_7$ has coefficients that are also squares.

  -- Let's try to find a relationship between these equations.
  -- Notice that the coefficients in the second equation are the squares of the coefficients in the first equation,
  -- and the same for the third equation. This suggests a pattern.

  -- Let's analyze the structure of the equations more formally.
  -- We have three equations:
  -- 1. $1^2 a + 2^2 b + 3^2 c + 4^2 d + 5^2 e + 6^2 f + 7^2 g = 1$
  -- 2. $2^2 a + 3^2 b + 4^2 c + 5^2 d + 6^2 e + 7^2 f + 8^2 g = 12$
  -- 3. $3^2 a + 4^2 b + 5^2 c + 6^2 d + 7^2 e + 8^2 f + 9^2 g = 123$

  -- We need to find the value of $4^2 a + 5^2 b + 6^2 c + 7^2 d + 8^2 e + 9^2 f + 10^2 g$

  -- Let's think about how to approach this.
  -- If we look at the pattern of coefficients, we can try to find a recurrence relation
  -- or a way to combine these equations to get the desired result.

  -- One approach is to treat this as a polynomial interpolation problem.
  -- The equations can be seen as evaluating a quadratic polynomial at different points.
  -- Let's consider $P(n) = an^2 + bn^2 + cn^2 + dn^2 + en^2 + fn^2 + gn^2$ as our polynomial.
  -- Then we have:
  -- $P(1) = 1^2 a + 2^2 b + 3^2 c + 4^2 d + 5^2 e + 6^2 f + 7^2 g = 1$
  -- $P(2) = 2^2 a + 3^2 b + 4^2 c + 5^2 d + 6^2 e + 7^2 f + 8^2 g = 12$
  -- $P(3) = 3^2 a + 4^2 b + 5^2 c + 6^2 d + 7^2 e + 8^2 f + 9^2 g = 123$

  -- We need to find $P(4) = 4^2 a + 5^2 b + 6^2 c + 7^2 d + 8^2 e + 9^2 f + 10^2 g$

  -- Since we're dealing with a quadratic polynomial, we can determine it uniquely by three points.
  -- We can use finite differences to find the result.
  -- Let's calculate the differences:
  -- $P(2) - P(1) = (2^2 a + 3^2 b + 4^2 c + 5^2 d + 6^2 e + 7^2 f + 8^2 g) - (1^2 a + 2^2 b + 3^2 c + 4^2 d + 5^2 e + 6^2 f + 7^2 g) = 12 - 1$
  -- This simplifies to $(3^2-2^2)a + (4^2-3^2)b + (5^2-4^2)c + (6^2-5^2)d + (7^2-6^2)e + (8^2-7^2)f + (9^2-8^2)g = 11$
  -- Similarly, $P(3) - P(2) = 123 - 12 = 111$
  -- The second difference $P(3) - 2P(2) + P(1) = 123 - 24 + 1 = 100$

  -- This suggests a pattern: $P(n) = (n+1)^2 a + (n+2)^2 b + (n+3)^2 c + (n+4)^2 d + (n+5)^2 e + (n+6)^2 f + (n+7)^2 g$
  -- Evaluating at $n=1,2,3$ gives us:
  -- $P(1) = 4a + 9b + 16c + 25d + 36e + 49f + 64g = 1$
  -- $P(2) = 9a + 16b + 25c + 36d + 49e + 64f + 81g = 12$
  -- $P(3) = 16a + 25b + 36c + 49d + 64e + 81f + 100g = 123$

  -- We are looking for $P(4) = 25a + 36b + 49c + 64d + 81e + 100f + 121g$

  -- From the second difference, we have $P(3) - 2P(2) + P(1) = 100$
  -- $123 - 24 + 1 = 100$, which confirms our calculation.

  -- To find $P(4)$, we can use the pattern of finite differences.
  -- The second difference should be constant for a quadratic polynomial.
  -- So $P(4) - 2P(3) + P(2) = 100$
  -- $P(4) - 246 + 12 = 100$
  -- $P(4) = 100 + 246 - 12 = 334$

  -- Thus, $16a + 25b + 36c + 49d + 64e + 81f + 100g = 334$

  -- Let's complete the Lean proof to verify this result:

  have eq1 : 16 * a + 25 * b + 36 * c + 49 * d + 64 * e + 81 * f + 100 * g = 334 := by
    -- To solve this, we can use the fact that the equations are structured as a system of linear equations
    -- and we can use Lean's computational engine to solve it.
