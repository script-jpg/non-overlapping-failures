-- First step: Rewrite the system of equations in matrix form to make it easier to solve.
  let A :=!![1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49]
  let B :=!![1, 12, 123 : ℝ]

  -- Second step: Calculate the determinant of A.
  have detA : A.det = 210 := by
    simp only [A]
    -- We use the formula for determinant of a 7x7 matrix, which is too complicated to compute by hand.
    -- Thus, we let the computer calculate it.
    norm_num

  -- Third step: Solve the system of equations.
  have x := A.inv * B
  let ⟨a, b, c, d, e, f, g⟩ := x

  -- Fourth step: Calculate the determinant of the extended matrix.
  have detAx : (A | B).det = 0 := by
    simp only [A, B]
    -- We use the formula for determinant of a 7x8 matrix, which is too complicated to compute by hand.
    -- Thus, we let the computer calculate it.
    norm_num

  -- Fifth step: Find the value of the determinant of the extended matrix with the last column removed.
  have detAx' : (A |!![0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]).det = 210 := by
    rw [←detA]
    simp only [A, x]
    -- We use the formula for determinant of a 7x7 matrix, which is too complicated to compute by hand.
    -- Thus, we let the computer calculate it.
    norm_num

  -- Sixth step: Find the value of $16x_1+25x_2+36x_3+49x_4+64x_5+81x_6+100x_7$.
  have : 16 * a + 25 * b + 36 * c + 49 * d + 64 * e + 81 * f + 100 * g = 334 := by
    -- We solve the system of equations to find the values of $a,b,c,d,e,f,g$.
    -- It is too complicated to compute by hand, so we let the computer calculate it.
    simp only [A, x] at *
    norm_num [detA, detAx, detAx'] at *
    linarith

  -- Seventh step: Claim the final result.
