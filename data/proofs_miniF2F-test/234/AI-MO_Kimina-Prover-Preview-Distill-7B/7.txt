-- difference of diff is constant
  have : 123 - 12 + 1 = 100 - 64 := by linarith
  -- so we have new equation
  have h₃ : 100 * a + 64 * b + 49 * c + 36 * d + 25 * e + 16 * f + 9 * g = 123 + 12 - 1 := by linarith
  -- use previous equations to solve
  have : 16 * a + 25 * b + 36 * c + 49 * d + 64 * e + 81 * f + 100 * g = 334 := by linarith
