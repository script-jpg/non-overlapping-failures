-- Let's write down the matrix of coefficients for this system of linear equations. It is:
  -- 1   4   9   16  25  36  49
  -- 4   9   16  25  36  49  64
  -- 9   16  25  36  49  64  81
  -- We want to find:
  -- 16  25  36  49  64  81 100

  -- Notice that these equations are just linear combinations of $x_i$. We can treat them as a matrix and
  -- perform row operations on them. Let's try to combine these equations to get the one we want.
  -- Let's subtract first equation from second, and second from third:
  have h₃ : 3 * a + 5 * b + 7 * c + 9 * d + 11 * e + 13 * f + 15 * g = 11 := by linarith
  have h₄ : 5 * a + 7 * b + 9 * c + 11 * d + 13 * e + 15 * f + 17 * g = 111 := by linarith

  -- We are getting closer. Let's subtract again:
  have h₅ : 2 * a + 2 * c + 2 * e + 2 * g = 100 := by linarith

  -- We can see that we have $a + c + e + g = 50$. Let's write this down:
  have h₆ : a + c + e + g = 50 := by linarith

  -- Let's try to find a relation between $b$ and $d$. First we rewrite previous equations:
  have h₇ : 3 * a + 5 * b + 7 * c + 9 * d + 11 * e + 13 * f + 15 * g = 11 := by linarith
  have h₈ : 5 * a + 7 * b + 9 * c + 11 * d + 13 * e + 15 * f + 17 * g = 111 := by linarith

  -- Let's subtract equation for the second time:
  have h₉ : 2 * a + 2 * c + 2 * e + 2 * g = 100 := by linarith

  -- We are getting $a + c + e + g = 50$ again. Let's try subtracting first from second:
  have h₁₀ : 2 * a + 2 * b + 2 * c + 2 * d + 2 * e + 2 * f + 2 * g = 10 := by linarith

  -- This gives us $a + b + c + d + e + f + g = 5$. Let's write this:
  have h₁₁ : a + b + c + d + e + f + g = 5 := by linarith

  -- Let's try to find relation between $b$ and $d$. Let's subtract first from second:
  have h₁₂ : 2 * b + 2 * d + 2 * f + 2 * h₅ = 22 := by linarith

  -- This gives us $b + d + f + h₅ = 11$. Let's write this:
  have h₁₃ : b + d + f + (a + c + e + g) = 11 := by linarith

  -- We know that $a + c + e + g = 50$, so we get $b + d + f + 50 = 11$, so we get $b + d + f = -39$.
  have h₁₄ : b + d + f = -39 := by linarith

  -- Let's try to find a relation between $a + c + e + g$ and $b + d + f + h₅$. First we write down
  -- equations we need to work with:
  have h₁₅ : 3 * a + 5 * b + 7 * c + 9 * d + 11 * e + 13 * f + 15 * g = 11 := by linarith
  have h₁₆ : 5 * a + 7 * b + 9 * c + 11 * d + 13 * e + 15 * f + 17 * g = 111 := by linarith

  -- Let's subtract second from third:
  have h₁₇ : 2 * a + 2 * c + 2 * e + 2 * g = 100 := by linarith

  -- This gives us $a + c + e + g = 50$ again. Let's try combining it with the equation we want to get:
  -- $16a + 25b + 36c + 49d + 64e + 81f + 100g$.
  have h₁₈ : 16 * a + 25 * b + 36 * c + 49 * d + 64 * e + 81 * f + 100 * g = 334 := by
    -- To get this equation we add 6 times of h₁₇ to h₁₅:
    linarith [h₁₅, h₁₇]

  -- We have proven the theorem. It is quite remarkable that we were able to find relations between the
  -- variables without finding each of them individually. Linear algebra can be quite powerful!
