  To prove that \((x+1)^2 \cdot x = x^3 + 2x^2 + x\), we start by expanding \((x+1)^2\). Using the binomial theorem, \((x+1)^2\) can be expanded as \(x^2 + 2x + 1\). Multiplying this result by \(x\), we get \((x^2 + 2x + 1) \cdot x = x^3 + 2x^2 + x\). This directly shows that the left-hand side equals the right-hand side, completing the proof.
