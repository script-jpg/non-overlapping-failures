  To prove that \((x+1)^2 \cdot x = x^3 + 2x^2 + x\), we start by expanding \((x+1)^2\). We know that \((x+1)^2\) can be rewritten as \(x^2 + 2x + 1\). Multiplying this by \(x\) gives us:
  \[
  (x^2 + 2x + 1) \cdot x = x^2 \cdot x + 2x \cdot x + 1 \cdot x = x^3 + 2x^2 + x
  \]
  Thus, the equality holds.
