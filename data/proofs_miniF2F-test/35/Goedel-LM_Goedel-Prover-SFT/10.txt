  To prove that \((x + 1)^2 \cdot x = x^3 + 2x^2 + x\), we start by expanding \((x + 1)^2\). The binomial theorem states that \((x + 1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1\). Multiplying this result by \(x\), we get:
  \[
  (x^2 + 2x + 1) \cdot x = x^3 + 2x^2 + x
  \]
  This directly shows that the left-hand side of the equation equals the right-hand side, completing the proof.
