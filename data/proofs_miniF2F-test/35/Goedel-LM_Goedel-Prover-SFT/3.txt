  To prove that \((x+1)^2 \cdot x = x^3 + 2x^2 + x\), we start by expanding \((x+1)^2\). This gives us \(x^2 + 2x + 1\). Multiplying this result by \(x\) yields \(x^3 + 2x^2 + x\), which matches the right-hand side of the equation.

  -- Expand (x+1)^2 to x^2 + 2x + 1 and then multiply by x.
  -- This step is implicit in the `simp` tactic, which simplifies the expression using known identities.
  simp only [add_sq, mul_add, mul_one, mul_assoc, mul_comm, mul_left_comm, add_assoc, add_comm]
  -- Use the `ring` tactic to simplify the expression and verify that it matches the right-hand side.
