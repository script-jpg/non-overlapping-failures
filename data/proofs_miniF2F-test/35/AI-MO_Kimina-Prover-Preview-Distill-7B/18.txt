ring
```

The `ring` tactic is powerful enough to expand polynomial expressions like $(x+1)^2 \cdot x$ and verify that it equals $x^3 + 2x^2 + x$. It will apply the distributive property, collect like terms, and simplify the expression automatically.

Let me manually verify this expansion:

- $(x+1)^2 = (x+1)(x+1) = x^2 + 2x + 1$
- Then $(x^2 + 2x + 1) \cdot x = x^3 + 2x^2 + x$

So indeed, $(x+1)^2 \cdot x = x^3 + 2x^2 + x$.

The `ring` tactic handles these algebraic manipulations efficiently, saving us from having to write out each step explicitly.
