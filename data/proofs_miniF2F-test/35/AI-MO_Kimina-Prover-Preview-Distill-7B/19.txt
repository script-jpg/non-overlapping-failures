ring

The `ring` tactic is powerful enough to solve this algebraic identity by expanding the left-hand side and verifying it equals the right-hand side. It will expand $(x+1)^2 \cdot x$ as follows:

1. First, expand $(x+1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1$
2. Then multiply by $x$: $(x^2 + 2x + 1) \cdot x = x^3 + 2x^2 + x$
3. This matches the right-hand side $x^3 + 2x^2 + x$

Thus the `ring` tactic is sufficient to prove this equality directly.

For the second part of the goal, we need to show that $x^3 + 2x^2 + x = x(x+1)^2$, which is the reverse of the first equality:

```tactics

 Expand the product $(x+1)^2 \cdot x$. Show that it is x^3 + 2x^2 + x.-/
theorem mathd_algebra_176 (x : ℝ) : (x + 1) ^ 2 * x = x ^ 3 + 2 * x ^ 2 + x := by
  ring
```

Again, the `ring` tactic can handle this algebraic manipulation automatically. It will factor out $x$ from the left-hand side to get $x(x^2 + 2x + 1) = x(x+1)^2$, which matches the right-hand side.

Therefore, both parts of the goal can be solved using the `ring` tactic, which is designed to solve equalities in commutative rings by normalization and comparison of canonical forms.
