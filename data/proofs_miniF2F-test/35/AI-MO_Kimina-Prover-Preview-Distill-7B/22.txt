```

In the formal Lean 4 proof, we need to show that $(x+1)^2 \cdot x = x^3 + 2x^2 + x$ for any real number $x$.

First, let's think about how to prove this algebraic identity. We need to expand the left-hand side and verify it equals the right-hand side.

1. Start by expanding $(x+1)^2$:
   - $(x+1)^2 = (x+1) \cdot (x+1) = x \cdot x + x \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot x + 1 \cdot 1 = x^2 + x + x + 1 = x^2 + 2x + 1$.

2. Now multiply the result by $x$:
   - $(x^2 + 2x + 1) \cdot x = x^2 \cdot x + 2x \cdot x + 1 \cdot x = x^3 + 2x^2 + x$.

This gives us $x^3 + 2x^2 + x$, which is exactly the right-hand side of our goal.

In Lean, we can prove this equality directly using the `ring` tactic, which is powerful for proving identities in commutative rings:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

We have imported the necessary libraries and opened namespaces to access mathematical definitions and lemmas.

Now we'll state the theorem:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_176 (x : ℝ) : (x + 1) ^ 2 * x = x ^ 3 + 2 * x ^ 2 + x := by
```

We have the theorem statement with a real number parameter `x`. Now we need to prove the equality.

Since this is a straightforward algebraic manipulation, we can prove it directly:

```tactics
ring
```

The `ring` tactic is powerful enough to expand polynomial expressions and prove equalities in commutative rings. It will:
1. Expand $(x + 1)^2$ to $x^2 + 2x + 1$
2. Multiply by $x$ to get $x^3 + 2x^2 + x$
3. Verify that this equals the right-hand side

The proof is complete. We've shown that for any real number $x$, $(x+1)^2 \cdot x = x^3 + 2x^2 + x$.

The Lean proof is elegant because it directly applies the algebraic properties of real numbers to expand the polynomial expression. The `ring` tactic is particularly powerful for these kinds of problems as it can handle all the algebraic manipulations that we would do by hand.
