ring

```

The `ring` tactic is perfect for this problem because it can automatically prove equalities involving polynomial expressions. It expands the left side, $(x+1)^2 \cdot x$, as follows:

1. First, expand $(x+1)^2$ to $x^2 + 2x + 1$ using the binomial theorem.
2. Then multiply by $x$: $(x^2 + 2x + 1) \cdot x = x^3 + 2x^2 + x$.

The `ring` tactic handles these algebraic manipulations automatically, proving that $(x+1)^2 \cdot x = x^3 + 2x^2 + x$ for any real number $x$.

This is a straightforward algebraic expansion that would typically be done by hand in a high school algebra class. The `ring` tactic in Lean 4 automates this process, making it a simple and efficient proof.
