So the complete proof is:

```tactics

theorem mathd_algebra_176 (x : ℝ) : (x + 1) ^ 2 * x = x ^ 3 + 2 * x ^ 2 + x := by
  ring
```

This proof is correct because the `ring` tactic in Lean is powerful enough to expand polynomial expressions algebraically. 

Expanding the left-hand side: 
- $(x + 1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1$ (by the binomial theorem)
- Multiplying by $x$: $(x^2 + 2x + 1) \cdot x = x^3 + 2x^2 + x$

The `ring` tactic will perform these algebraic manipulations automatically and verify that the equality holds for all real numbers $x$. 

The Lean proof is remarkably concise because the problem is purely algebraic and involves basic polynomial expansion, which Lean's automated tactics can handle efficiently. This demonstrates how Lean can verify algebraic identities in a very straightforward manner, without requiring manual step-by-step proof construction that would be needed for more complex mathematical reasoning.
