The `ring` tactic is powerful enough to automatically expand the left-hand side and verify that it equals the right-hand side. 

Let's think about how we would expand $(x+1)^2 \cdot x$ by hand:
1. First, expand $(x+1)^2 = (x+1) \cdot (x+1) = x^2 + 2x + 1$
2. Then multiply by $x$: $(x^2 + 2x + 1) \cdot x = x^3 + 2x^2 + x$
3. This gives us $x^3 + 2x^2 + x$, which matches the right-hand side of our goal.

The `ring` tactic in Lean 4 is able to perform these algebraic manipulations automatically. It recognizes that the equality follows from the ring axioms (associativity, commutativity, distributivity of multiplication over addition) and applies them as needed to transform the left-hand side into the right-hand side.

Therefore, our complete proof is simply:

theorem mathd_algebra_176 (x : ℝ) : (x + 1) ^ 2 * x = x ^ 3 + 2 * x ^ 2 + x := by
  ring
```

This is a perfect example of how Lean's automation can handle basic algebraic manipulations that would be tedious to write out explicitly. The `ring` tactic is particularly powerful for goals involving polynomial equalities over a commutative ring.
