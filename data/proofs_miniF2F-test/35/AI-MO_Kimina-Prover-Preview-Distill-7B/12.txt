The proof is straightforward algebraic manipulation that can be handled by the `ring` tactic in Lean 4. The `ring` tactic is powerful enough to expand polynomial expressions and verify equalities in commutative rings. 

Let's verify the expansion manually:
- $(x+1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1$ (binomial expansion)
- $(x^2 + 2x + 1) \cdot x = x^3 + 2x^2 + x$ (distributive property)

The `ring` tactic would perform these steps automatically:
1. Expand $(x+1)^2$ to $x^2 + 2x + 1$
2. Multiply by $x$ to get $x^3 + 2x^2 + x$
3. Verify that this equals the right-hand side of the equation

Therefore, the complete formal proof is:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

We're importing Mathlib and Aesop, setting the heartbeats to unlimited, and opening several namespaces to make the theorem statement more convenient. Mathlib gives us access to real number operations and the ring tactic, while Aesop and the heartbeats setting help with automated proof tactics.

Now, let's define the theorem:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_176 (x : ℝ) : (x + 1) ^ 2 * x = x ^ 3 + 2 * x ^ 2 + x := by
  ring
```

The theorem states that for any real number $x$, the expression $(x+1)^2 \cdot x$ expands to $x^3 + 2x^2 + x$. The proof is simply applying the `ring` tactic, which is designed to solve equalities in commutative rings by normalizing both sides and checking if they are identical.

The Lean 4 proof is remarkably concise because the problem is purely algebraic and fits exactly what the `ring` tactic is designed for. This tactic can handle all the algebraic manipulations we would do by hand, such as expanding the square and distributing the multiplication, to show that the two expressions are indeed equal.
