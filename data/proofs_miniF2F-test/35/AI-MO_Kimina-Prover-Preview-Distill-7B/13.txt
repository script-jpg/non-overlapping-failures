The theorem states that $(x+1)^2 \cdot x = x^3 + 2x^2 + x$ for any real number $x$. The proof is straightforward using algebraic expansion.

First, let's expand $(x+1)^2$:
- $(x+1)^2 = (x+1) \cdot (x+1) = x \cdot x + x \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot x + 1 \cdot 1 = x^2 + x + x + 1 = x^2 + 2x + 1$

Now multiply this by $x$:
- $(x^2 + 2x + 1) \cdot x = x^2 \cdot x + 2x \cdot x + 1 \cdot x = x^3 + 2x^2 + x$

This matches the right-hand side of the equation, $x^3 + 2x^2 + x$. Therefore, the equality holds for any real number $x$.

In Lean, the proof is remarkably concise because Lean's automation can handle algebraic manipulations efficiently. The `ring` tactic is powerful enough to perform all the algebraic steps we outlined above automatically. It expands the expression $(x+1)^2 \cdot x$ and simplifies it to $x^3 + 2x^2 + x$ by applying the distributive property and combining like terms.

So the complete Lean 4 proof is:

This proof is elegant in its simplicity. The `ring` tactic is powerful for solving goals involving algebraic expressions in commutative rings. It automatically handles all the algebraic manipulations that we would normally do by hand: expanding $(x+1)^2$, multiplying by $x$, and simplifying to get the final result. 

The Lean proof is much more concise than the informal proof because Lean's automation is handling all the algebraic steps that we would write out manually. This demonstrates how powerful Lean's automation can be for solving straightforward algebraic problems, allowing us to focus on more complex mathematical reasoning where human insight is needed.
