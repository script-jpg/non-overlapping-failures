ring

The `ring` tactic is perfect for this algebraic manipulation. It automatically expands the expression $(x+1)^2 \cdot x$:
- First, it expands $(x+1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1$
- Then multiplies by $x$: $(x^2 + 2x + 1) \cdot x = x^3 + 2x^2 + x$

So the final result is $x^3 + 2x^2 + x$, which is exactly what we needed to prove.

The key insight was recognizing that $(x+1)^2 \cdot x$ could be expanded using basic algebraic operations, and the `ring` tactic in Lean is designed to handle precisely these kinds of algebraic manipulations. This demonstrates how powerful automated tactics can be for algebraic reasoning, saving us from having to work through each step of the expansion manually.
