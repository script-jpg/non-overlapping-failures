This completes the proof. The `ring` tactic is powerful for algebraic manipulations like this, as it can expand expressions, collect like terms, and verify equality of polynomial expressions. The theorem statement declares that for any real number x, the expression (x+1)^2 * x is equal to x^3 + 2x^2 + x, and the `ring` tactic proves this by performing the algebraic expansion and simplification automatically.

The expansion proceeds as follows:
- First, expand (x+1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1
- Then multiply by x: (x^2 + 2x + 1) * x = x^3 + 2x^2 + x

The result is indeed x^3 + 2x^2 + x, which matches the right-hand side of the equation in our theorem.

Therefore, the formal proof confirms that (x+1)^2 * x = x^3 + 2x^2 + x for all real numbers x.
