The proof uses the `ring` tactic, which in Lean 4 is powerful enough to solve goals involving equalities of polynomial expressions. The tactic automatically expands the left-hand side, $(x+1)^2 \cdot x$, and shows it is equal to $x^3 + 2x^2 + x$.

The algebraic steps it performs are:
1. Expand $(x+1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1$
2. Multiply by $x$: $(x^2 + 2x + 1) \cdot x = x^3 + 2x^2 + x$

The Lean 4 proof is remarkably concise because the `ring` tactic can handle all the algebraic manipulations that would take several steps to prove manually.

Therefore, the final answer is $ \boxed{x^3 + 2x^2 + x} $, which is proven by Lean 4's `ring` tactic.
