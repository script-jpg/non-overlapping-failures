-- We can expand the expression directly
  calc (x + 1) ^ 2 * x = (x^2 + 2 * x + 1) * x := by ring -- Expand $(x+1)^2$ and get $x^2 + 2x + 1$.
                     _ = x ^ 3 + 2 * x ^ 2 + x := by ring -- Distribute $x$ across the terms. 

```

This completes our proof. The Lean proof is remarkably concise because Lean's tactics can directly solve algebraic identities like this one. The `ring` tactic is powerful for solving goals involving equalities in commutative rings. It automatically handles the algebraic manipulations that we would do by hand: expanding $(x+1)^2$ to $x^2 + 2x + 1$, and then distributing $x$ across each term to get $x^3 + 2x^2 + x$.

The informal calculation shows:
1. Start with $(x+1)^2 \cdot x$
2. Expand $(x+1)^2$ to $x^2 + 2x + 1$ (using the binomial theorem or direct expansion)
3. Distribute $x$ across each term in $x^2 + 2x + 1$:
   - $x \cdot x^2 = x^3$
   - $x \cdot 2x = 2x^2$
   - $x \cdot 1 = x$
4. Combine these to get $x^3 + 2x^2 + x$

The Lean proof uses the `ring` tactic to perform these steps automatically, demonstrating how Lean can handle basic algebraic manipulations that would be tedious to write out explicitly in a proof.
