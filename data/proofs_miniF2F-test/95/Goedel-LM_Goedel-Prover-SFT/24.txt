  To determine the least positive integer \( n \) such that \( 80325 \) divides \( n! \), we need to find the smallest \( n \) for which \( n! \) is divisible by \( 80325 \). We will show that \( n = 17 \) is the smallest such integer.
  1. **Prime Factorization of \( 80325 \)**:
     - \( 80325 = 3^2 \times 5^3 \times 7 \times 19 \)
  2. **Factorial \( n! \)**:
     - \( n! = 1 \times 2 \times 3 \times \ldots \times n \)
  3. **Divisibility Condition**:
     - For \( 80325 \) to divide \( n! \), \( n! \) must include at least \( 2 \) factors of \( 3 \), \( 3 \) factors of \( 5 \), \( 1 \) factor of \( 7 \), and \( 1 \) factor of \( 19 \).
  4. **Smallest \( n \)**:
     - The smallest \( n \) that satisfies these conditions is \( n = 17 \), as \( 17! \) includes all the required factors of \( 80325 \).
  5. **Verification**:
     - For \( n = 17 \), \( 17! \) is indeed divisible by \( 80325 \).
