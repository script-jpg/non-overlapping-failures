  To determine the least positive integer \( n \) such that \( 80325 \) divides \( n! \), we need to show that \( n \geq 17 \). We will use the fact that \( 80325 = 3^5 \times 5^3 \times 19 \). For \( 80325 \) to divide \( n! \), it must divide \( n \) and all its factors. Specifically, we need to ensure that \( n \) is large enough to include all these factors.

  -- Simplify the factorial expression and the divisibility condition.
  simp only [Nat.factorial] at h₁
  -- Use contraposition to show that if n < 17, then 80325 does not divide n!.
  contrapose! h₁
  -- Use interval_cases to check each possible value of n less than 17.
