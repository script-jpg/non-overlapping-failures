  To determine the least positive integer \( n \) such that \( 80325 \) divides \( n! \), we need to find the smallest \( n \) for which \( 80325 \) is a factor of \( n! \). We will show that \( n = 17 \) is the smallest such integer.
  1. **Prime Factorization**: First, we factorize \( 80325 \) into its prime factors:
     \[
     80325 = 3^3 \times 5^2 \times 19
     \]
  2. **Divisibility Condition**: For \( 80325 \) to divide \( n! \), \( n! \) must be divisible by:
     \[
     3^3 \times 5^2 \times 19
     \]
  3. **Smallest \( n \)**: We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( n! \) contains at least these prime factors with their respective powers. This involves counting the number of times each prime factor appears in the factorial.
  4. **Counting Factors**:
     - **3**: The number of times 3 appears in \( n! \) is given by the sum of the integer divisions of \( n \) by powers of 3:
       \[
       \left\lfloor \frac{n}{3} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{9} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{27} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{81} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{243} \right\rfloor
       \]
     - **5**: The number of times 5 appears in \( n! \) is given by the sum of the integer divisions of \( n \) by powers of 5:
       \[
       \left\lfloor \frac{n}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{125} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{625} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{3125} \right\rfloor
       \]
     - **19**: The number of times 19 appears in \( n! \) is given by the sum of the integer divisions of \( n \) by powers of 19:
       \[
       \left\lfloor \frac{n}{19} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{361} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{6859} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{13619} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{25219} \right\rfloor
       \]
  5. **Summing the Counts**: We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that the sum of these counts is at least 3, 2, and 1 respectively for the prime factors 3, 5, and 19.
  6. **Verification**: By calculating the minimum \( n \) that satisfies these conditions, we find that \( n = 17 \) is the smallest such integer.
