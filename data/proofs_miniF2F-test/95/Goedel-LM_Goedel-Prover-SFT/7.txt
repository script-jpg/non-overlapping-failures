  To determine the least positive integer \( n \) such that \( 80325 \) divides \( n! \), we need to find the smallest \( n \) for which \( n! \) contains the prime factorization of \( 80325 \). The prime factorization of \( 80325 \) is \( 3^3 \times 5^4 \times 7 \times 17 \). We will show that \( n = 17 \) is the smallest integer for which \( n! \) contains this prime factorization.
  1. **Factorial Calculation**:
     - \( 17! = 17 \times 16 \times 15 \times \cdots \times 1 \)
     - We need to verify that \( 17! \) contains \( 3^3 \), \( 5^4 \), \( 7 \), and \( 17 \).
  2. **Divisibility Check**:
     - We will check the divisibility step by step to ensure that \( 17! \) is divisible by \( 80325 \).
  3. **Conclusion**:
     - By checking the divisibility, we find that \( n = 17 \) is the smallest integer for which \( 80325 \) divides \( n! \).
