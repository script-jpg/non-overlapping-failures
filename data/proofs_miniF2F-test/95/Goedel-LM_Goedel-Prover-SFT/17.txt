  To show that the least positive integer \( n \) such that \( 80325 \) divides \( n! \) is \( 17 \), we need to demonstrate that \( 17 \leq n \) for any \( n \) satisfying the given conditions. We will use the fact that \( 80325 \) divides \( n! \) and apply basic arithmetic and factorial properties to establish the required inequality.

  -- We start by assuming the contrary, that n < 17.
  apply le_of_not_lt
  intro h
  -- We know that 80325 divides n!.
  have h₂ : 80325 ∣ n! := h₁
  -- We will show that this leads to a contradiction.
  -- First, we use the fact that n < 17 to bound the factorial.
  have h₃ : n ≤ 16 := by linarith
  -- We use the factorial properties and the fact that 80325 divides n! to derive a contradiction.
  interval_cases n <;> simp_all [Nat.factorial]
  -- By checking each case from 0 to 16, we find that none of these cases satisfy the divisibility condition.
  -- This leads to a contradiction, proving that n must be at least 17.
