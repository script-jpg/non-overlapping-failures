  To determine the least positive integer \( n \) such that \( 80325 \) divides \( n! \), we need to find the smallest \( n \) for which \( 80325 \) is a factor of \( n! \). This involves understanding the prime factorization of \( 80325 \) and the smallest \( n \) that satisfies this condition.
  1. **Prime Factorization of \( 80325 \)**:
     \[
     80325 = 3^2 \times 5^2 \times 7 \times 13 \times 17
     \]
     This is derived from the factorization of \( 80325 \) into its prime components.
  2. **Smallest \( n \)**:
     To ensure \( 80325 \) divides \( n! \), \( n \) must have at least the prime factors \( 3^2 \times 5^2 \times 7 \times 13 \times 17 \). Therefore, \( n \) must be at least \( 17 \).
