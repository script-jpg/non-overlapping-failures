  To determine the least positive integer \( n \) such that \( 80325 \) divides \( n! \), we need to show that \( 17 \leq n \). We start by assuming the contrary, that \( n < 17 \). Given the divisibility condition \( 80325 \mid n! \), we will check each integer from 1 to 16 to see if \( n! \) is divisible by 80325. By contradiction, if none of these integers satisfy the divisibility condition, then \( n \) must be at least 17.
