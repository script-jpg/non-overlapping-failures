  To determine the least positive integer \( n \) such that \( 80325 \) divides \( n! \), we need to show that \( n \geq 17 \). Given that \( 80325 \) is a specific integer, we can use the properties of divisibility and factorials to establish this bound.
  -/
  -- We use contraposition to show that if \( n < 17 \), then \( 80325 \) does not divide \( n! \).
  contrapose! h₁
  -- We use interval_cases to check each possible value of \( n \) less than 17.
  interval_cases n <;> norm_num [Nat.factorial] at h₁ ⊢
  -- For each value of \( n \), we check if \( 80325 \) divides \( n! \). If it does not, we conclude that \( n \) must be at least 17.
