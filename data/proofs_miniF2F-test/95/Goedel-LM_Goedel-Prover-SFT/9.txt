  To show that the least positive integer \( n \) such that \( 80325 \) divides \( n! \) is 17, we proceed as follows:
  1. Assume for contradiction that \( n < 17 \).
  2. We need to show that \( 80325 \) does not divide \( n! \) for \( n < 17 \).
  3. Consider the prime factorization of \( 80325 \). The prime factorization is \( 3^2 \times 5^2 \times 7 \times 13 \times 17 \).
  4. For \( n < 17 \), the factorial \( n! \) contains the factors \( 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, \) and \( 17 \) but does not contain \( 17 \) as a factor.
  5. Therefore, \( 80325 \) does not divide \( n! \) for \( n < 17 \).
  6. Hence, the least positive integer \( n \) such that \( 80325 \) divides \( n! \) is indeed 17.
