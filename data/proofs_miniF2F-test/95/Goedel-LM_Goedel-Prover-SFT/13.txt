  To show that the least positive integer \( n \) such that \( 80325 \) divides \( n! \) is 17, we proceed as follows:
  1. **Establish the divisibility condition**: We need to show that \( 80325 \) divides \( n! \) for some \( n \).
  2. **Verify the divisibility for \( n = 17 \)**: We check that \( 80325 \) divides \( 17! \).
  3. **Prove that 17 is the least such number**: We show that for any \( n < 17 \), \( 80325 \) does not divide \( n! \).

  -- We know that `n` is less than 17, so we can check the divisibility condition for `n < 17`.
  have h₂ := h₁
  rw [Nat.factorial_succ] at h₁
  -- We use the fact that `n!` is divisible by 80325 to derive a contradiction if `n < 17`.
  revert h₁
  revert h₂
  revert h₀
  -- We use a decision procedure to check the divisibility condition for `n < 17`.
