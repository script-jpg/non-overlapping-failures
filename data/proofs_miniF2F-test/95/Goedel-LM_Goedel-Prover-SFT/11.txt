  To determine the least positive integer \( n \) such that \( 80325 \) divides \( n! \), we need to show that \( n \geq 17 \). We will use the given conditions and properties of factorials to establish this.
  1. **Establish the divisibility condition**: We know that \( 80325 \) divides \( n! \).
  2. **Prime factorization**: The prime factorization of \( 80325 \) is \( 3 \times 5^2 \times 7 \times 17 \).
  3. **Factorial**: For \( n! \) to be divisible by \( 80325 \), \( n! \) must contain at least \( 3 \), \( 5^2 \), \( 7 \), and \( 17 \) as factors.
  4. **Minimum value of \( n \)**: Since \( n! \) must be divisible by \( 80325 \), the smallest \( n \) that satisfies this condition is \( 17 \).

  have h₂ := h₁
  rw [Nat.factorial] at h₂
  -- We know that 80325 divides n!, so we need to show that n ≥ 17.
  -- Since 80325 = 3 * 5^2 * 7 * 17, n! must contain at least these factors.
  -- Therefore, n must be at least 17.
  have h₃ := Nat.le_of_dvd (by linarith) h₁
  -- We use the fact that 80325 divides n! to conclude that n ≥ 17.
