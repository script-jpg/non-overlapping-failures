  To determine the least positive integer \( n \) such that \( 80325 \) divides \( n! \), we need to find the smallest \( n \) for which \( 80325 \) divides \( n! \). We are given that \( n = 17 \) is such a number. We will verify that \( 80325 \) indeed divides \( 17! \) and that no smaller \( n \) satisfies this condition.

  -- We need to show that 17 is the least positive integer n such that 80325 divides n!.
  apply le_of_not_lt
  intro h
  -- Assume for contradiction that n < 17.
  revert h₁
  revert h₀
  revert n
  -- We will check each integer from 1 to 16 to see if any of them satisfy the divisibility condition.
