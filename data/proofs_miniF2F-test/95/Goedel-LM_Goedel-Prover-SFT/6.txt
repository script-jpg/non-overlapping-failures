  To show that the least positive integer \( n \) such that \( 80325 \) divides \( n! \) is 17, we need to demonstrate that for any \( n \) less than 17, \( 80325 \) does not divide \( n! \). We proceed by contradiction. Assume \( n < 17 \) and \( 80325 \) divides \( n! \). We then check each \( n \) from 1 to 16 and show that none of these values satisfy \( 80325 \) dividing \( n! \).

  -- We know that 80325 divides n!.
  have h₂ : 80325 ∣ n! := h₁
  -- We will check each n from 1 to 16 and show that none of these values satisfy 80325 dividing n!.
