  To show that the least positive integer \( n \) such that \( 80325 \) divides \( n! \) is \( 17 \), we proceed as follows:
  1. We start by assuming that \( 17 \leq n \).
  2. We then use the fact that \( 80325 \) divides \( n! \) and the properties of factorials to derive the necessary inequality.
  3. We use the `norm_num` tactic to perform numerical verification and simplification.
  4. Finally, we use the `omega` tactic to solve the resulting linear inequality.
