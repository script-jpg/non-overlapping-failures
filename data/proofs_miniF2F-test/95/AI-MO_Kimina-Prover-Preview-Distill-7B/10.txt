-- We need to prove that the smallest positive integer $n$ such that $80325$ divides $n!$ is 17.

    -- We will prove that if $n!$ is divisible by 80325, then $n \geq 17$.
    -- To do this, we'll show that the prime factorization of 80325 requires at least 17!
    -- First, let's determine the prime factorization of 80325.
    -- 80325 = 5^2 * 3 * 7 * 17
    -- This requires at least 17! because 17! includes the factor 17, which is prime.

    -- We need to show that if n < 17, then 80325 ∤ n!
    -- Let's consider n = 16. Is 80325 | 16!?
    -- 16! = 2^15 * 3^6 * 5^3 * 7^2 * 11 * 13
    -- It does not include the factor 17, so 80325 ∤ 16!
    -- Similarly, for all n < 17, n! does not include the factor 17, so 80325 ∤ n!
