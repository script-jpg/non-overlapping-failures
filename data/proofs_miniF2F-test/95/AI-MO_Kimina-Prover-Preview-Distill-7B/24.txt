-- We need to find the least positive integer $n$ such that $80325$ divides $n!$.

  -- First, we find the prime factorization of $80325$.
  have hprime : 80325 = 5 ^ 2 * 3 * 17 ^ 2 := by norm_num

  -- Next, we determine the smallest $n$ such that $n!$ contains at least one factor of each prime in the factorization of $80325$.
  -- For $5^2$, we need at least one factor of $5$ in $n!$.
  -- For $3$, we need at least one factor of $3$ in $n!$.
  -- For $17^2$, we need at least two factors of $17$ in $n!$.

  -- Since $17$ is a prime number, $17!$ will contain one factor of $17$ from each number $1$ through $17$.
  -- To get two factors of $17$, we need to go at least $34!$ (since $17 \times 2 = 34$).

  -- However, we also need to consider the factors of $5$ and $3$ in $34!$.
  -- $34!$ contains multiple factors of $5$ and $3$ from numbers like $5$, $10$, $15$, $20$, $25$ (for $5$) and $3$, $6$, $9$, $12$, $15$, $18$, $21$, $24$, $27$, $30$, $33$ (for $3$).

  -- Thus, the smallest $n$ is $17$, since $17!$ contains at least one factor of each prime in $80325$.
  -- $17! = 17 \times 16 \times 15 \times 14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1$
  --  $= 17 \times (2^4) \times (3 \times 5) \times (2 \times 7) \times 13 \times (2^2 \times 3) \times 11 \times (2 \times 5) \times (3^2) \times (2^3) \times 7 \times (2 \times 3) \times 5 \times (2^2) \times 3 \times 2$
  --  $= 2^{15} \times 3^6 \times 5^3 \times 7^2 \times 11 \times 13 \times 17$
  --  $80325 = 3 \times 5^2 \times 17^2$
  --  So $17!$ contains $80325$ as a factor.

  -- We will prove by contradiction that $n \geq 17$.
