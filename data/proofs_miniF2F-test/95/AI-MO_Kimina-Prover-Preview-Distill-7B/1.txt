-- We need to find the least positive integer $n$ such that $80325$ divides $n!$.

  -- First, we need to factorize $80325$. We can do this by hand or by using a calculator.

  -- By using a calculator, we can find that $80325 = 80325 = 3^3 \times 5^2 \times 7 \times 17$.

  have hfactor : 80325 = 3^3 * 5^2 * 7 * 17 := by norm_num

  -- Now, we need to determine the smallest $n$ such that $n!$ contains at least one $3^3$, one $5^2$, one $7$, and one $17$.

  -- For this, we can use the concept of Legendre's formula, which tells us the exponent of a prime $p$ in $n!$.

  -- The exponent of a prime $p$ in $n!$ is given by $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^k} \right\rfloor$.

  -- We need to ensure that $n!$ contains at least:
  -- - One $3^3$ (i.e., $\lfloor n/3 \rfloor + \lfloor n/9 \rfloor + \lfloor n/27 \rfloor + \cdots \geq 3$)
  -- - One $5^2$ (i.e., $\lfloor n/5 \rfloor + \lfloor n/25 \rfloor + \cdots \geq 2$)
  -- - One $7$ (i.e., $\lfloor n/7 \rfloor + \cdots \geq 1$)
  -- - One $17$ (i.e., $\lfloor n/17 \rfloor + \cdots \geq 1$)

  -- Let's check for the prime 17 first. The first condition $\lfloor n/17 \rfloor \geq 1$ gives $n \geq 17$.
