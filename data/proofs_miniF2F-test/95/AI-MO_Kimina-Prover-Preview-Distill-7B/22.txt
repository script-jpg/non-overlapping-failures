-- We need to find the least positive integer $n$ such that $80325$ divides $n!$.

  -- First, let's factorize $80325$.
  have h₂ : 80325 = 17 * 4725 := by norm_num
  have h₃ : 4725 = 3 * 1575 := by norm_num
  have h₄ : 1575 = 3 * 5 * 105 := by norm_num
  have h₅ : 105 = 3 * 5 * 7 := by norm_num
  have h₆ : 75 = 3 * 25 := by norm_num
  have h₇ : 25 = 5 * 5 := by norm_num

  -- So $80325 = 17 \times 3^4 \times 5^2 \times 7$.

  -- Now, let's find the smallest $n$ such that $n!$ contains at least one $17$, four $3$'s, two $5$'s, and one $7$.
  -- The key insight is to check when the prime factors of $80325$ appear in $n!$.

  -- The number $17$ is prime, so we need $n \geq 17$ just to have $17!$.
  -- Let's check if $17!$ has enough $3$'s, $5$'s, and $7$'s.
  -- To count the number of a prime $p$ in $n!$, we can use the formula: $\sum_{k \geq 1} \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^k} \right\rfloor$.

  -- For $17!$:
  -- - Number of $3$'s: $\left\lfloor \frac{17}{3} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{17}{9} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{17}{27} \right\rfloor = 5 + 1 + 0 = 6$
  -- - Number of $5$'s: $\left\lfloor \frac{17}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{17}{25} \right\rfloor = 3 + 0 = 3$
  -- - Number of $7$'s: $\left\lfloor \frac{17}{7} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{17}{49} \right\rfloor = 2 + 0 = 2$

  -- So $17!$ has $6 \cdot 3^1 \cdot 5^3 \cdot 7^2$, which is more than enough for $80325 = 17 \times 3^4 \times 5^2 \times 7$.

  -- Let's write the Lean proof:

  -- We need to show that for any $n > 0$ such that $80325 \mid n!$, we have $17 \leq n$.

  -- Let's compute the prime factorization of $17!$:
  -- - Number of $17$'s: $\left\lfloor \frac{17}{17} \right\rfloor = 1$
  -- - Number of $3$'s: $\left\lfloor \frac{17}{3} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{17}{9} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{17}{27} \right\rfloor = 5 + 1 + 0 = 6$
  -- - Number of $5$'s: $\left\lfloor \frac{17}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{17}{25} \right\rfloor = 3 + 0 = 3$
  -- - Number of $7$'s: $\left\lfloor \frac{17}{7} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{17}{49} \right\rfloor = 2 + 0 = 2$
  -- - Number of other primes: We need to check up to $\sqrt{17} \approx 4.123$, so we need $2$'s, $3$'s, $5$'s, $7$'s, $11$'s, and $13$'s
  -- - Number of $2$'s: $\left\lfloor \frac{17}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{17}{4} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{17}{8} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{17}{16} \right\rfloor = 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 15$
  -- - Number of $3$'s: As above
  -- - Number of $5$'s: As above
  -- - Number of $7$'s: As above
  -- - Number of $11$'s: $\left\lfloor \frac{17}{11} \right\rfloor = 1$
  -- - Number of $13$'s: $\left\lfloor \frac{17}{13} \right\rfloor = 1$

  -- So $17! = 2^{15} \times 3^6 \times 5^3 \times 7^2 \times 11^1 \times 13^1 \times 17^1$.

  -- And $80325 = 17 \times 3^4 \times 5^2 \times 7$.

  -- So $17!$ has more than enough factors to be divisible by $80325$.

  -- But wait, actually $17!$ has exactly the required factors, so we need to check if $n < 17$ would work.

  -- For $n < 17$, we don't have $17!$ as a multiple of $80325$.
  -- Because $17$ is prime, if $n < 17$, then $n!$ cannot have $17$ as a factor, so $80325$ cannot divide $n!$.

  -- Let's finish the Lean proof by showing that $80325$ does not divide $16!$.
