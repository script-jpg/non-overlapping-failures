-- Hmmm, so we need to show that $17 \leq n$ is the least positive integer such that $80325$ divides $n!$.
  -- Let's first think about the prime factorization of $80325$.
  -- Using the fact that $80325 = 80325 / 3^3 \cdot 3^3 = 80325 / 27 \cdot 27 = 2975 \cdot 27$
  -- and $2975 = 2975 / 5^2 \cdot 5^2 = 2975 / 25 \cdot 25 = 119 \cdot 25$,
  -- and $119 = 119 / 7 \cdot 7 = 17 \cdot 7$.
  -- Thus, $80325 = 3^3 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 7 \cdot 17$.
  have h₂ : 80325 = 3^3 * 5^2 * 7 * 17 := by norm_num

  -- Now, we need to show that $17 \leq n$.
  -- To show this, we need to argue that $17$ does not divide $n!$ when $n < 17$.
  by_contra! h₂
  -- Let's think about this. If $n < 17$, then $n!$ does not include $17$ as a factor.
  -- Thus, $17 \nmid n!$ when $n < 17$.
  -- So we need to show that $17 \mid 80325$ which is obvious since $80325 = 3^3 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 7 \cdot 17$.
  -- Thus, we need to show that $17 \mid n!$ if and only if $n \geq 17$.
  -- The key point is that whether $17 \mid n!$ is determined by whether $17 \leq n$.
  -- If $17 \leq n$, then $17 \mid n!$; otherwise, $17 \nmid n!$.
  -- This is similar to how prime numbers divide factorials.
  -- Thus, we need to show that $17 \mid n! \iff 17 \leq n$.
  -- To show this, we can argue by contradiction.
  -- If $17 \mid n!$ and $n < 17$, then we have a contradiction.
  have h₃ : n < 17 := by linarith

  -- Now, how can we show that $17 \nmid n!$ when $n < 17$?
  -- The factorial $n! = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdots n$ includes all integers from 1 to n.
  -- If $n < 17$, then $n!$ does not include $17$ as a factor.
  -- Thus, $17 \nmid n!$ when $n < 17$.
  have h₄ : ¬ 17 ∣ n! := by
    -- Let's show this by contradiction.
    -- Assume that $17 \mid n!$ when $n < 17$.
    by_contra! h₄
    -- We can use a proof by cases to check each value of $n$ from 1 to 16.
    interval_cases n
    -- Let's do this systematically.
    -- For each value of $n$ from 1 to 16, we can compute $n!$ and check divisibility by 17.
    -- However, since 17 is prime, and $n!$ does not include 17 as a factor when $n < 17$,
    -- we know that $17 \nmid n!$ for $n < 17$.

      contradiction

  have h₅ : 17 ∣ n! := by
    rw [h₂] at h₁
    exact dvd_trans (by norm_num) h₁

  -- Now, we have a contradiction: $17 \nmid n!$ when $n < 17$,
  -- but we have $17 \mid n!$ from our hypothesis.
  contradiction
