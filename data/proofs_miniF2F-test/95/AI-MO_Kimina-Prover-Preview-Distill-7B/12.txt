-- We need to prove that $17 \leq n$.

  -- We check if $80325$ is prime.
  -- It is not, because $80325 = 89^2 \cdot 3^3 \cdot 5^2$.
  -- So, we check if $n!$ contains prime factors $89$, $3$, and $5$.
  -- We check if $89$, $3$, and $5$ are factors of $n!$, and so we need to
  -- check the least $n$ such that $89^2$, $3^3$, and $5^2$ divides $n!$.
  -- The smallest prime factor is $5$, so we check if $5^2$ is a factor.
  -- If $n = 10$, $10!$ does not contain $5^2$ as a factor.
  -- If $n = 15$, $15!$ does not contain $5^2$ as a factor.
  -- If $n = 17$, $17!$ contains $5^2$ as a factor, as well as $3^3$ and $89^2$.
