-- We need to prove that $17 \leq n$.

  -- We know that $80325 \mid n!$.

  have h₂ : 80325 ∣ n! := h₁

  -- Let's consider the prime factorization of 80325.

  -- $80325 = 3^3 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 7 \cdot 17$

  have h₃ : 80325 = 3^3 * 5^2 * 7 * 17 := by norm_num

  -- So, $n!$ must contain at least:
  -- - $3^3$ as a factor
  -- - $5^2$ as a factor
  -- - $7$ as a factor
  -- - $17$ as a factor

  -- Let's consider the largest prime factor, which is 17.

  -- We want to show that $17 \leq n$.

  -- Suppose $n < 17$.

  by_contra! h

  -- Then $n \mid 16$

  have h₄ : n < 17 := h

  -- Then $17 \nmid n!$ as $n < 17$
