-- We need to find the least positive integer $n$ such that $80325$ divides $n!$.

  -- First, we need to factorize $80325$. We can do this by hand or use a calculator. Let's use a calculator:

  -- Prime factorization of $80325$ is $3^3 \times 5^2 \times 7 \times 17$.

  -- Now, we need to determine the smallest $n$ such that $n!$ contains at least these prime factors with the given multiplicities.

  -- Let's think about how prime factors are distributed in factorials:

  -- - For $3^3$: We need at least three factors of 3. The first few factorials are: $1! = 1$, $2! = 2$, $3! = 6 = 2 \times 3$, $4! = 24 = 2^3 \times 3$, $5! = 120 = 2^3 \times 3 \times 5$, $6! = 720 = 2^4 \times 3^2 \times 5$, $7! = 5040 = 2^4 \times 3^2 \times 5 \times 7$, $8! = 40320 = 2^7 \times 3^2 \times 5 \times 7$, $9! = 362880 = 2^7 \times 3^4 \times 5 \times 7$, $10! = 3628800 = 2^8 \times 3^4 \times 5^2 \times 7$.

  -- We can see that by $10!$, we have enough factors of 3 ($3^4$), but we need to check other prime factors as well.

  -- - For $5^2$: We need at least two factors of 5. From $10!$, we already have $5^2$.

  -- - For $7$: We need at least one factor of 7. From $7!$, we have 7.

  -- - For $17$: We need at least one factor of 17. The first factorial that includes 17 is $17!$.

  -- So, we need $n \geq 17$ to include all required prime factors with the necessary multiplicities.

  -- Since $17$ is a prime number, we need to check if $16!$ contains all the required prime factors:

  -- $16! = 2^{15} \times 3^6 \times 5^3 \times 7^2 \times 11 \times 13$ (after prime factorization)

  -- Comparing with the required $3^3 \times 5^2 \times 7 \times 17$:

  -- - $3^3$ is satisfied as $6$ (from $3^6$)

  -- - $5^2$ is satisfied as $3$ (from $5^3$)

  -- - $7$ is satisfied as $1$ (from $7^2$)

  -- - But $17$ is not present in $16!$ as it is a prime greater than 16

  -- So $16!$ does not have $17$ as a factor, thus $17$ is the smallest $n$ such that $80325 \mid n!$.

  have h₂ : n ≥ 17 := by

    -- Let's think about how to prove this.

    -- We need to show that $17 \leq n$ given that $80325 \mid n!$ and $n > 0$.

    -- We can use proof by contradiction. If $n < 17$, then $n \leq 16$.

    -- For $n \leq 16$, $n!$ does not include the prime factor 17, so 17 does not divide $n!$.

    -- But 17 divides 80325, so 80325 cannot divide $n!$ if $n < 17$.

      -- For each case where $n < 17$, we can compute the factorial and check divisibility.

      -- However, this would be tedious to do by hand. Instead, we can use Lean's computation capabilities:
