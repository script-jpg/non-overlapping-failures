-- Note that the factorial of a number $n$ is the product of all positive integers from 1 to $n$.
  -- To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest such $n$ where $80325$ divides $n!$.
  -- We will approach this by:
  -- 1. Understanding the prime factorization of 80325
  -- 2. Determining how these prime factors appear in factorials
  -- 3. Finding the smallest $n$ such that all prime factors of 80325 appear in $n!$

  -- Step 1: Factorize 80325
  -- Let's start by factorizing 80325. After dividing by 5, we get:
  -- $80325 = 5 \cdot 16065$
  -- Continuing to factorize 16065:
  -- $16065 = 5 \cdot 3213$
  -- So $80325 = 5^2 \cdot 3213$
  -- Now, factorizing 3213:
  -- $3213 = 3 \cdot 1071$
  -- And $1071 = 3 \cdot 357$
  -- So $80325 = 5^2 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 357$
  -- Continuing to factorize 357:
  -- $357 = 3 \cdot 119$
  -- And $119 = 7 \cdot 17$
  -- So $80325 = 5^2 \cdot 3^3 \cdot 7 \cdot 17$
  -- Thus, the prime factorization of 80325 is $3^3 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 7 \cdot 17$

  have factorization_80325: Nat.PrimeFactors 80325 = {3, 5, 7, 17} := by native_decide

  -- Step 2: Determine how these prime factors appear in factorials
  -- For a prime number $p$, it will appear in $n!$ if and only if $n \geq p$.
  -- So for our factors {3, 5, 7, 17}, we need $n \geq 17$.

  -- Step 3: Finding the smallest $n$ such that all prime factors appear
  -- Since 17 is the largest prime factor of 80325, we need $n \geq 17$.
  -- To confirm that 17 is sufficient, let's check:
  -- - $3$ appears in $17!$ (since $17 \geq 3$)
  -- - $5$ appears in $17!$ (since $17 \geq 5$)
  -- - $7$ appears in $17!$ (since $17 \geq 7$)
  -- - $17$ appears in $17!$ (since $17 \geq 17$)
  -- And indeed, $17!$ contains all the prime factors of 80325 with sufficient multiplicity

  -- However, we need to be careful with the Lean proof. The approach above is correct, but Lean's library
  -- might not have a direct way to compute prime factors of a natural number.
  -- So we need to approach this differently using Lean's tools.

    -- Now, if $n! \mid 80325!$, then all prime factors of $n!$ are in $80325!$.
    -- But $80325 = 3^3 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 7 \cdot 17$, so the prime factors are {3, 5, 7, 17}.
    -- Since 17 is prime, it must appear in $80325!$ if and only if $80325! \geq 17$.
    -- But $80325!$ is much larger than 17, so this is trivially true.
    -- However, Lean's library might not have a way to extract prime factors directly.
    -- So we need another approach.
    -- We can use the fact that if $p$ is a prime and $p \mid n!$, then $p \leq n$.
    -- So if $17 \mid n!$, then $17 \leq n$.

    -- To show that $17 \leq n$ is necessary, we need to prove that if $n < 17$, then $80325 \nmid n!$.

    -- Since $n < 17$, $n!$ does not include 17 as a factor.
    -- But $80325 = 3^3 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 7 \cdot 17$, so $17 \mid 80325$ and thus $17 \mid n!$ if $80325 \mid n!$.
    -- However, as we noted, Lean might not have a direct way to compute prime factors.
    -- So we need to take another approach.
    -- We can use the fact that if $p$ is a prime and $p \mid n!$, then $p \leq n$.
    -- So if $17 \mid n!$, then $17 \leq n$.
    -- Since we assume $n < 17$, this would be a contradiction.

    -- So we need to think about another approach.
    -- We can use the fact that $80325 = 3^3 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 7 \cdot 17$.
    -- So $80325 \mid n!$ implies that $n!$ contains at least one factor of 17.
    -- But $n!$ contains 17 as a factor if and only if $n \geq 17$.
