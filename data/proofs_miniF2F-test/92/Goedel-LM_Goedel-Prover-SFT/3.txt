  Given \(2^a = 32\) and \(a^b = 125\), we need to find \(b^a\). We start by noting that \(32 = 2^5\). Therefore, we can rewrite the equation \(2^a = 32\) as \(2^a = 2^5\). By the properties of exponents, we know that \(a = 5\). Substituting \(a = 5\) into the equation \(a^b = 125\), we get \(5^b = 125\). We know that \(5^3 = 125\), so we can solve for \(b\) by setting \(b = 3\). Thus, \(b^a = 3^5 = 243\).
