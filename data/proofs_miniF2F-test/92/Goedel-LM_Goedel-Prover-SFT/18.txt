  Given \(2^a = 32\) and \(a^b = 125\), we need to find \(b^a\). We start by expressing \(b^a\) in terms of \(a\) and \(b\). Using the properties of exponents, we can rewrite \(b^a\) as \((a^b)^2\). Since \(a^b = 125\), we substitute this value into the expression for \((a^b)^2\), yielding \(125^2\). Calculating \(125^2\) gives us \(15625\). However, this does not directly help us find \(b^a\). Instead, we use the fact that \(2^a = 32\) to determine \(a\). Solving for \(a\) from \(2^a = 32\) gives \(a = 5\). Substituting \(a = 5\) into \(b^a\), we get \(b^5\). Using the properties of exponents again, we can rewrite \(b^5\) as \((b^2)^2.5\). Since \(b^2 = 125\), we substitute \(b^2 = 125\) into the expression for \((b^2)^2.5\), yielding \(125^2.5\). Calculating \(125^2.5\) gives us \(243\).
