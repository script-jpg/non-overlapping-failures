  Given \(2^a = 32\) and \(a^b = 125\), we need to find \(b^a\). We start by expressing \(32\) as a power of \(2\). We know that \(32 = 2^5\). Therefore, we can rewrite the equation \(2^a = 32\) as \(2^a = 2^5\). This implies that \(a = 5\).
  Next, we use the equation \(a^b = 125\). Substituting \(a = 5\) into this equation, we get \(5^b = 125\). We know that \(125 = 5^3\). Therefore, \(b = 3\).
  Now, we need to find \(b^a\). Substituting \(b = 3\) and \(a = 5\) into the expression \(b^a\), we get \(3^5\). We know that \(3^5 = 243\). Thus, the value of \(b^a\) is \(243\).
