  Given \(2^a = 32\) and \(a^b = 125\), we need to find \(b^a\). We start by expressing \(b^a\) in terms of \(a\) and \(b\). Using the properties of exponents, we can rewrite \(b^a\) as \((a^b)^2\). Given \(a^b = 125\), we substitute this into the expression to get \(125^2\). Calculating \(125^2\) gives us \(15625\). However, we need to verify the correct form and ensure the calculations align with the given values.
