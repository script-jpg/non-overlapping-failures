  Given \(2^a = 32\) and \(a^b = 125\), we need to find \(b^a\). We start by expressing \(a\) in terms of the given equation \(2^a = 32\). We know that \(32 = 2^5\), so \(a = 5\). Substituting \(a = 5\) into the equation \(a^b = 125\), we get \(5^b = 125\). We know that \(125 = 5^3\), so \(b = 3\). Therefore, \(b^a = 3^5 = 243\).
