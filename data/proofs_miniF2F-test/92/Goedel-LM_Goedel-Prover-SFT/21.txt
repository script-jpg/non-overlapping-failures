  Given \(2^a = 32\) and \(a^b = 125\), we need to find \(b^a\). We start by expressing \(a\) in terms of \(b\) from the second equation. Using the property of exponents, we can rewrite \(a^b = 125\) as \(a = \log_b 125\). Substituting this into the first equation, we get \(2^{\log_b 125} = 32\). Using the change of base formula, we find that \(b = 3\). Substituting \(b = 3\) back into \(a = \log_b 125\), we get \(a = 3\). Finally, we calculate \(b^a = 3^3 = 243\).
