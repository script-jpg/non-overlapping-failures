  Given \(2^a = 32\) and \(a^b = 125\), we need to find \(b^a\). We start by expressing \(b^a\) in terms of \(a\) and \(b\). Using the properties of exponents, we can rewrite \(b^a\) as \(a^b\). Given \(a^b = 125\), we substitute this into the expression for \(b^a\). Since \(2^a = 32\), we can solve for \(a\) by recognizing that \(32 = 2^5\), so \(a = 5\). Substituting \(a = 5\) into \(a^b = 125\), we get \(5^b = 125\). Solving for \(b\), we find \(b = 3\). Finally, we calculate \(b^a\) as \(3^5 = 243\).
