  Given \(2^a = 32\) and \(a^b = 125\), we need to find \(b^a\).
  First, we solve for \(a\) from the equation \(2^a = 32\). We know that \(32 = 2^5\), so \(a = 5\).
  Next, we substitute \(a = 5\) into the equation \(a^b = 125\). This gives us \(5^b = 125\).
  We solve for \(b\) by recognizing that \(125 = 5^3\). Therefore, \(b = 3\).
  Finally, we need to find \(b^a\). Substituting \(b = 3\) and \(a = 5\), we get \(3^5 = 243\).
