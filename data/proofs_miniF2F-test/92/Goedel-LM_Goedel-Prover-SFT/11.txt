  Given \(2^a = 32\) and \(a^b = 125\), we need to find \(b^a\). We start by expressing \(32\) as a power of \(2\), specifically \(32 = 2^5\). This allows us to rewrite the equation \(2^a = 32\) as \(2^a = 2^5\). By the property of exponents, if the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal, so \(a = 5\). Next, we use the given \(a^b = 125\) and substitute \(a = 5\) into this equation. This gives us \(5^b = 125\). We then solve for \(b\) by expressing \(125\) as a power of \(5\), specifically \(125 = 5^3\). Thus, \(5^b = 5^3\), and by the property of exponents, if the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal, so \(b = 3\). Finally, we need to find \(b^a\). Substituting \(b = 3\) and \(a = 5\), we get \(b^a = 3^5 = 243\).
