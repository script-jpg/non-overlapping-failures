  Given \(2^a = 32\) and \(a^b = 125\), we need to find \(b^a\). We start by expressing \(b^a\) in terms of \(a\) and \(b\). Using the given equations, we can derive the necessary values and relationships to solve for \(b^a\).
  1. From \(2^a = 32\), we find \(a = 5\) because \(2^5 = 32\).
  2. Substituting \(a = 5\) into \(a^b = 125\), we get \(5^b = 125\).
  3. Solving for \(b\), we find \(b = 3\) because \(5^3 = 125\).
  4. Finally, we calculate \(b^a = 3^5 = 243\).
