  Given \(2^a = 32\) and \(a^b = 125\), we need to find \(b^a\). We start by expressing \(a\) in terms of the given equation \(2^a = 32\). Solving for \(a\), we find \(a = 5\) because \(2^5 = 32\). Substituting \(a = 5\) into the equation \(a^b = 125\), we get \(5^b = 125\). Solving for \(b\), we find \(b = 3\) because \(5^3 = 125\). Thus, \(b^a = 3^5 = 243\).
