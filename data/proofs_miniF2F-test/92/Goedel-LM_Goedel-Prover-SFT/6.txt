  Given \(2^a = 32\) and \(a^b = 125\), we need to find \(b^a\) and show that it equals 243.
  1. From \(2^a = 32\), we can deduce that \(a = 5\) because \(2^5 = 32\).
  2. Substituting \(a = 5\) into \(a^b = 125\), we get \(5^b = 125\).
  3. Solving for \(b\), we find \(b = 3\) because \(5^3 = 125\).
  4. Finally, substituting \(b = 3\) and \(a = 5\) into \(b^a\), we get \(3^5 = 243\).
