  Given \(2^a = 32\) and \(a^b = 125\), we need to find \(b^a\). We start by expressing \(a\) in terms of the given equation \(2^a = 32\). We know that \(32 = 2^5\), so we have \(2^a = 2^5\). By the equality of powers, we conclude that \(a = 5\). Next, we substitute \(a = 5\) into the equation \(a^b = 125\). This gives us \(5^b = 125\). We know that \(125 = 5^3\), so we have \(5^b = 5^3\). By the equality of powers, we conclude that \(b = 3\). Finally, we calculate \(b^a\), which is \(3^5\), and we find that \(3^5 = 243\).
