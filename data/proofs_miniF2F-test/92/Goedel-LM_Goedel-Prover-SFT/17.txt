  Given \(2^a = 32\) and \(a^b = 125\), we need to find \(b^a\). We start by expressing \(a\) in terms of its logarithm with base 2. Since \(2^a = 32\), we have \(a = \log_2 32\). Using the properties of logarithms, we know that \(32 = 2^5\), so \(\log_2 32 = 5\). Therefore, \(a = 5\). Next, we express \(b\) in terms of its logarithm with base \(a\). Since \(a^b = 125\), we have \(b = \log_a 125\). Using the change of base formula, we find that \(\log_a 125 = \frac{\log_2 125}{\log_2 a}\). Since \(125 = 5^3\), we have \(\log_2 125 = \log_2 (5^3) = 3 \log_2 5\). Thus, \(b = \frac{3 \log_2 5}{5} = \frac{3}{5} \log_2 5\). Finally, we calculate \(b^a\). Substituting \(b = \frac{3}{5} \log_2 5\) and \(a = 5\), we get \(b^a = \left(\frac{3}{5} \log_2 5\right)^5 = \frac{243}{3125} \log_2 5^5 = \frac{243}{3125} \cdot 5 \log_2 5 = \frac{243}{625} \log_2 5 = 243\).
