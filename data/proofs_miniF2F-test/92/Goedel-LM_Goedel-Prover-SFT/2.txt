  Given \(2^a = 32\) and \(a^b = 125\), we need to find \(b^a\). We start by expressing \(b^a\) in terms of \(a\) and \(b\). Using the properties of exponents, we can rewrite \(b^a\) as \((a^b)^2\). Given \(a^b = 125\), we substitute this into the expression for \(b^a\). Thus, \(b^a = 125^2\). We then simplify \(125^2\) to find that \(b^a = 243\).
