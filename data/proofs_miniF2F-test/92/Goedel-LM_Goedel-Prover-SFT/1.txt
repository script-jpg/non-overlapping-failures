  Given \(2^a = 32\) and \(a^b = 125\), we need to find \(b^a\). We start by expressing \(32\) as a power of \(2\). We know that \(32 = 2^5\). Therefore, we can rewrite the equation \(2^a = 32\) as \(2^a = 2^5\). By the properties of exponents, if \(2^a = 2^5\), then \(a = 5\). Next, we use the equation \(a^b = 125\) and substitute \(a = 5\) into the equation. This gives us \(5^b = 125\). We then solve for \(b\) by recognizing that \(125 = 5^3\). Therefore, \(5^b = 5^3\), which implies \(b = 3\). Finally, we calculate \(b^a\) using the values \(b = 3\) and \(a = 5\), yielding \(b^a = 3^5 = 243\).
