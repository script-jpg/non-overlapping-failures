  Given nonnegative integers \( A, M, \) and \( C \) such that \( A + M + C = 12 \), we need to determine the maximum value of \( A \cdot M \cdot C + A \cdot M + M \cdot C + A \cdot C \).
  To show that the maximum value of the expression is at most 112, we consider the constraints on \( A, M, \) and \( C \). Since \( A + M + C = 12 \), we can infer that each of \( A, M, \) and \( C \) must be less than or equal to 12. By analyzing the possible values of each variable, we can derive the maximum value of the expression.

  -- We start by noting the given condition that the sum of A, M, and C is 12.
  have : a + m + c = 12 := h₀
  -- We use the fact that the sum of A, M, and C is 12 to infer that each variable is less than or equal to 12.
  have h₁ : a ≤ 12 := by linarith
  have h₂ : m ≤ 12 := by linarith
  have h₃ : c ≤ 12 := by linarith
  -- We use interval cases to consider all possible values of A, M, and C that satisfy the constraints.
  interval_cases a <;> interval_cases m <;> interval_cases c <;>
    -- We use norm_num to compute the value of the expression for each combination of A, M, and C.
    norm_num [Nat.mul_assoc] <;>
    -- We use linarith to verify that the computed value is less than or equal to 112.
