  Given nonnegative integers \( A, M, \) and \( C \) such that \( A + M + C = 12 \), we need to find the maximum value of \( A \cdot M \cdot C + A \cdot M + M \cdot C + A \cdot C \). We will show that the maximum value is 112.
  1. **Case Analysis**: We analyze the possible values of \( A, M, \) and \( C \) given the constraint \( A + M + C = 12 \).
  2. **Nonnegative Integer Constraints**: Since \( A, M, \) and \( C \) are nonnegative integers, we use the fact that their sum is 12 to bound the product terms.
  3. **Simplification and Maximization**: By considering the constraints and the properties of the numbers, we simplify the expression and use basic arithmetic to show that the maximum value of the expression is 112.
