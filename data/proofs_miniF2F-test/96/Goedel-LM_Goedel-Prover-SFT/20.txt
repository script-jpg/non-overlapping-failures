  Given nonnegative integers \( A, M, \) and \( C \) such that \( A + M + C = 12 \), we need to find the maximum value of the expression \( A \cdot M \cdot C + A \cdot M + M \cdot C + A \cdot C \).
  To prove the inequality \( A \cdot M \cdot C + A \cdot M + M \cdot C + A \cdot C \leq 112 \), we consider the possible values of \( A, M, \) and \( C \). Since \( A + M + C = 12 \), we can use the fact that the sum of these integers is 12 to bound the product terms.
  By analyzing the possible values of \( A, M, \) and \( C \) and their combinations, we can derive that the maximum value of the expression is indeed 112. This can be verified through a systematic check of all possible values within the constraints.
