  Given nonnegative integers \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \) such that \( A + M + C = 12 \), we need to find the maximum value of \( A \cdot M \cdot C + A \cdot M + M \cdot C + A \cdot C \).
  To prove that the maximum value is at most 112, we consider the constraints on the values of \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \). Since \( A + M + C = 12 \), we can use this to bound the expression \( A \cdot M \cdot C + A \cdot M + M \cdot C + A \cdot C \).
  By examining the possible values of \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \) that satisfy the sum constraint, we can derive that the maximum value of the expression is indeed 112. This can be verified through a detailed analysis of the possible combinations of \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \) that satisfy the sum constraint.

  -- Consider the constraints on the values of a, m, and c.
  have h₁ : a ≤ 12 := by linarith
  have h₂ : m ≤ 12 := by linarith
  have h₃ : c ≤ 12 := by linarith
  -- Use interval_cases to consider all possible values of a, m, and c within the constraints.
  interval_cases a <;> interval_cases m <;> interval_cases c <;> simp_all
  -- Use linarith to verify that the expression does not exceed 112 for any valid combination of a, m, and c.
