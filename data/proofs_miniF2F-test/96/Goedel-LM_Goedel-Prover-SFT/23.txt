  Given nonnegative integers \( A, M, \) and \( C \) such that \( A + M + C = 12 \), we need to find the maximum value of \( A \cdot M \cdot C + A \cdot M + M \cdot C + A \cdot C \).
  To prove this, we consider the possible values of \( A, M, \) and \( C \). Since \( A + M + C = 12 \), we can infer that each of \( A, M, \) and \( C \) must be at most 12. We then use the fact that the sum of these integers is 12 to bound the product terms.
  By examining the possible values of \( A, M, \) and \( C \) and their combinations, we can derive that the maximum value of the expression \( A \cdot M \cdot C + A \cdot M + M \cdot C + A \cdot C \) is 112. This is achieved when \( A = 4, M = 4, \) and \( C = 4 \).
