  Given nonnegative integers \( A, M, \) and \( C \) such that \( A + M + C = 12 \), we aim to find the maximum value of \( A \cdot M \cdot C + A \cdot M + M \cdot C + A \cdot C \). We will show that this value is at most 112.
  1. **Case Analysis**: We consider different cases for the values of \( A, M, \) and \( C \). Since \( A, M, \) and \( C \) are nonnegative integers and their sum is 12, we can use the fact that \( A, M, \) and \( C \) are integers between 0 and 12.
  2. **Simplification and Bound Analysis**: For each case, we simplify the expression \( A \cdot M \cdot C + A \cdot M + M \cdot C + A \cdot C \) and analyze if it is less than or equal to 112.
  3. **Conclusion**: By considering all possible values of \( A, M, \) and \( C \) that satisfy the sum constraint, we conclude that the maximum value of the expression is indeed 112.
