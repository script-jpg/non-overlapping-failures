  Given nonnegative integers \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \) such that \( A + M + C = 12 \), we need to determine the maximum value of \( A \cdot M \cdot C + A \cdot M + M \cdot C + A \cdot C \).
  To prove the maximum value of the expression \( A \cdot M \cdot C + A \cdot M + M \cdot C + A \cdot C \) is 112, we can use the fact that the sum of the integers \( A + M + C = 12 \). By considering the possible values of \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \) and their combinations, we can show that the maximum value of the expression is indeed 112.

  have h₁ : a + m + c = 12 := h₀
  -- We need to show that the expression A * M * C + A * M + M * C + A * C is less than or equal to 112.
  have h₂ : a * m * c + a * m + m * c + a * c ≤ 112 := by
