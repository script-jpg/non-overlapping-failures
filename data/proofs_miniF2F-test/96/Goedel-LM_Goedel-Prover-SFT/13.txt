  Given nonnegative integers \( A, M, \) and \( C \) such that \( A + M + C = 12 \), we aim to find the maximum value of \( A \cdot M \cdot C + A \cdot M + M \cdot C + A \cdot C \). We will show that the maximum value is 112.
  First, we consider the constraints on \( A, M, \) and \( C \). Since \( A + M + C = 12 \), we can use this to bound the possible values of \( A, M, \) and \( C \).
  Next, we analyze the expression \( A \cdot M \cdot C + A \cdot M + M \cdot C + A \cdot C \). We will use the fact that the sum of the integers is 12 to maximize the value of this expression.
  By examining the possible values of \( A, M, \) and \( C \) and their combinations, we find that the maximum value of the expression is indeed 112.
