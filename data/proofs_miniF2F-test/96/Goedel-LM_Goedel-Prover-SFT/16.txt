  Given nonnegative integers \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \) such that \( A + M + C = 12 \), we need to find the maximum value of the expression \( A \cdot M \cdot C + A \cdot M + M \cdot C + A \cdot C \).
  To prove that the maximum value is at most 112, we consider the possible values of \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \). Since \( A + M + C = 12 \), we can use the fact that the sum of these integers is 12 to bound the product terms. By examining the possible values and their combinations, we can derive the maximum value of the expression.

  -- Consider the possible values of a, m, and c that satisfy a + m + c = 12
  have : a + m + c = 12 := by simp_all
  -- Use the fact that the sum of a, m, and c is 12 to bound the product terms
  have : a ≤ 12 := by linarith
  have : m ≤ 12 := by linarith
  have : c ≤ 12 := by linarith
  -- Use interval cases to consider all possible values of a, m, and c
  interval_cases a <;> interval_cases m <;> interval_cases c <;>
    simp_all [Nat.mul_assoc]
  -- Use linarith to conclude that the maximum value of the expression is at most 112
