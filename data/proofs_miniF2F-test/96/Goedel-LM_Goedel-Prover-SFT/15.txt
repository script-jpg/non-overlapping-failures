  Given nonnegative integers \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \) such that \( A + M + C = 12 \), we need to determine the maximum value of \( A \cdot M \cdot C + A \cdot M + M \cdot C + A \cdot C \).
  To prove that the maximum value is at most 112, we consider the possible values of \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \) and their combinations. Since \( A + M + C = 12 \), we can use the fact that the sum of these integers is 12 to bound the expression \( A \cdot M \cdot C + A \cdot M + M \cdot C + A \cdot C \).
  By examining the possible values of \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \) and their combinations, we can derive that the maximum value of the expression is indeed 112. This can be verified by considering the constraints on \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \) and their sums, and applying basic algebraic inequalities.

  -- Since a + m + c = 12, we can use this constraint to bound the expression.
  -- We will use basic algebraic inequalities and the fact that the sum of a, m, and c is 12.
