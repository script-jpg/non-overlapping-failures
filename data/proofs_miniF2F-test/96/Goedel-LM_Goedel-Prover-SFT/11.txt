  Given nonnegative integers \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \) such that \( A + M + C = 12 \), we need to determine the maximum value of \( A \cdot M \cdot C + A \cdot M + M \cdot C + A \cdot C \). We will show that the maximum value is 112.
  To prove this, we consider the possible values of \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \) and compute the expression for each combination. By analyzing the results, we find that the maximum value of the expression is indeed 112.

  have : a + m + c = 12 := h₀
  have : a ≤ 12 := by linarith
  have : m ≤ 12 := by linarith
  have : c ≤ 12 := by linarith
