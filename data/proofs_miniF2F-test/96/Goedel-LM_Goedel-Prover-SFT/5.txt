  Given nonnegative integers \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \) such that \( A + M + C = 12 \), we need to determine the maximum value of the expression \( A \cdot M \cdot C + A \cdot M + M \cdot C + A \cdot C \).
  To prove this, we can use the fact that the sum of the integers is 12 and apply basic algebraic inequalities. By considering the possible values of each integer and their combinations, we can derive the maximum value of the expression.

  rcases m with (_ | _ | _ | _ | _ | _ | _ | _ | _) <;>
  rcases c with (_ | _ | _ | _ | _ | _ | _ | _ | _) <;>
  -- For each combination of a, m, and c, we simplify the expression and check the inequality.
