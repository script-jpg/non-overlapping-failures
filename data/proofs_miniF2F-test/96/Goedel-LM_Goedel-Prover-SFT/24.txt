  Given nonnegative integers \( A, M, \) and \( C \) such that \( A + M + C = 12 \), we aim to find the maximum value of \( A \cdot M \cdot C + A \cdot M + M \cdot C + A \cdot C \).
  To prove that the maximum value of the expression is 112, we consider the constraints and the possible values of \( A, M, \) and \( C \). Since \( A + M + C = 12 \), we can use this to bound the expression.
  First, we note that \( A, M, \) and \( C \) are nonnegative integers. We can use the fact that the sum of these integers is 12 to apply a brute-force approach to find the maximum value of the expression. By systematically checking the possible values of \( A, M, \) and \( C \) that satisfy the sum constraint, we can determine the maximum value of the expression.
