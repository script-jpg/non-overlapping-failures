  Given nonnegative integers \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \) such that \( A + M + C = 12 \), we need to find the maximum value of the expression \( A \cdot M \cdot C + A \cdot M + M \cdot C + A \cdot C \).
  To prove that the maximum value of this expression is at most 112, we can use the fact that the sum of \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \) is 12. By considering the constraints and the properties of multiplication and addition, we can derive the maximum possible value.
