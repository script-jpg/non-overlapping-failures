  Given nonnegative integers \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \) such that \( A + M + C = 12 \), we need to determine the maximum value of \( A \cdot M \cdot C + A \cdot M + M \cdot C + A \cdot C \).
  To prove that the maximum value is at most 112, we consider the possible values of \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \). Since \( A + M + C = 12 \), we can use the fact that the sum of these values is 12 to bound the expression \( A \cdot M \cdot C + A \cdot M + M \cdot C + A \cdot C \).
  By examining the possible values of \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \) that satisfy \( A + M + C = 12 \), we can derive that the maximum value of the expression is indeed 112. This can be verified through a detailed analysis of the possible combinations of \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \) that sum to 12.
