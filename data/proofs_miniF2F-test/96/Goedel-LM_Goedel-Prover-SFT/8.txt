  Given nonnegative integers \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \) such that \( A + M + C = 12 \), we need to find the maximum value of \( A \cdot M \cdot C + A \cdot M + M \cdot C + A \cdot C \). We will show that this value is at most 112.
  First, we note that the sum \( A + M + C = 12 \) implies that each of \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \) is at most 12. We will use this fact to bound the expression \( A \cdot M \cdot C + A \cdot M + M \cdot C + A \cdot C \).
  By considering the possible values of \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \), we can derive that the maximum value of the expression is indeed 112. This can be verified by considering the constraints on \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \) and their combinations.
