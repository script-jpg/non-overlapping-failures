  Given nonnegative integers \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \) such that \( A + M + C = 12 \), we aim to find the maximum value of \( A \cdot M \cdot C + A \cdot M + M \cdot C + A \cdot C \). We will show that this expression is at most 112.
  First, we note that the sum \( A + M + C = 12 \) implies that each of \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \) is at most 12. We will consider all possible values of \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \) and verify that the expression does not exceed 112.

  -- We start by considering the possible values of a, m, and c that satisfy the constraint a + m + c = 12.
  have h₁ : a ≤ 12 := by linarith
  have h₂ : m ≤ 12 := by linarith
  have h₃ : c ≤ 12 := by linarith
  -- We will consider all possible values of a, m, and c within the range [0, 12] and check the expression.
  interval_cases a <;> interval_cases m <;> interval_cases c <;> norm_num
  -- By evaluating the expression for all combinations of a, m, and c, we will confirm that it does not exceed 112.
