  Given nonnegative integers \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \) such that \( A + M + C = 12 \), we need to find the maximum value of the expression \( A \cdot M \cdot C + A \cdot M + M \cdot C + A \cdot C \). We will show that this maximum value is 112.
  First, we note that the sum \( A + M + C = 12 \) implies that each of \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \) is at most 12. We will consider all possible values of \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \) and verify that the expression \( A \cdot M \cdot C + A \cdot M + M \cdot C + A \cdot C \) does not exceed 112.

  -- We consider all possible values of a, m, and c that satisfy a + m + c = 12.
  have h₁ : a ≤ 12 := by linarith
  have h₂ : m ≤ 12 := by linarith
  have h₃ : c ≤ 12 := by linarith
  -- We use interval_cases to consider each possible value of a, m, and c.
  interval_cases a <;> interval_cases m <;> interval_cases c <;> norm_num
  -- For each combination of a, m, and c, we compute the value of the expression and check that it does not exceed 112.
