  Given nonnegative integers \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \) such that \( A + M + C = 12 \), we need to find the maximum value of \( A \cdot M \cdot C + A \cdot M + M \cdot C + A \cdot C \).
  To prove that the maximum value is at most 112, we consider the possible values of \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \). Since \( A + M + C = 12 \), we can use the fact that the sum of these integers is 12 to bound the product terms. By analyzing the possible values and their combinations, we can derive the maximum value of the expression.
