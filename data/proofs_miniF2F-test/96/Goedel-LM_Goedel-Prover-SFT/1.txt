  Given nonnegative integers \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \) such that \( A + M + C = 12 \), we need to find the maximum value of \( A \cdot M \cdot C + A \cdot M + M \cdot C + A \cdot C \). We will show that this value is at most 112.
  1. **Case Analysis**: We consider the possible values of \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \) and their combinations.
  2. **Nonnegativity and Sum Constraint**: Since \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \) are nonnegative integers, we use the given sum \( A + M + C = 12 \).
  3. **Expression Analysis**: We analyze the expression \( A \cdot M \cdot C + A \cdot M + M \cdot C + A \cdot C \) for all possible values of \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \).
  4. **Maximization**: By considering all combinations and their possible values, we find that the maximum value of the expression is 112.

  have h₂ : m ≤ 12 := by linarith
  have h₃ : c ≤ 12 := by linarith
  -- We perform case analysis on the possible values of a, m, and c.
