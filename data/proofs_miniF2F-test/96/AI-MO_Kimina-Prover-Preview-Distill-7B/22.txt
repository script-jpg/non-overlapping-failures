-- We need to consider all possible values of $a$, $m$, and $c$ such that $a + m + c = 12$.
  -- Since $a$, $m$, and $c$ are nonnegative integers, there are finitely many cases to consider.
  -- We can use `omega` to solve this kind of arithmetic problems involving integers and natural numbers.
  -- `omega` is a tactic that solves linear arithmetic problems over integers and natural numbers.
  -- It can determine whether a given inequality holds for all possible values of the variables involved.
  -- In this case, we can use `omega` to verify that $a \cdot m \cdot c + a \cdot m + m \cdot c + a \cdot c \leq 112$ for all $a, m, c \geq 0$ such that $a + m + c = 12$.
