The Lean proof will consider all possible values of $a, m, c$ such that $a + m + c = 12$ with $a, m, c \geq 0$. For each case, we compute the value of $a \cdot m \cdot c + a \cdot m + m \cdot c + a \cdot c$ and verify it is at most 112.

First, let's think about how to solve this algebraically to confirm the answer is indeed 112, and then we can verify through Lean's computation.

We need to maximize $a \cdot m \cdot c + a \cdot m + m \cdot c + a \cdot c$ given $a + m + c = 12$.

Let's consider symmetry and try some values:

- If we set $a = m = c = 4$, then $a + m + c = 12$ is satisfied.
- Compute the value: $4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 + 4 \cdot 4 + 4 \cdot 4 + 4 \cdot 4 = 64 + 16 + 16 + 16 = 112$

This gives us 112, which is one of the options. Let's check if this is indeed the maximum.

Suppose we try other values where one variable is 5:
- $a = 5$, $m = 5$, $c = 2$; $5 + 5 + 2 = 12$
- $5 \cdot 5 \cdot 2 + 5 \cdot 5 + 5 \cdot 2 + 5 \cdot 2 = 50 + 25 + 10 + 10 = 95$ (less than 112)

What if we try $a = 6$, $m = 3$, $c = 3$:
- $6 + 3 + 3 = 12$
- $6 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 + 6 \cdot 3 + 3 \cdot 3 + 6 \cdot 3 = 54 + 18 + 9 + 18 = 99$ (less than 112)

Another case: $a = 3$, $m = 3$, $c = 6$:
- $3 + 3 + 6 = 12$
- $3 \cdot 3 \cdot 6 + 3 \cdot 3 + 3 \cdot 6 + 3 \cdot 6 = 54 + 9 + 18 + 18 = 99$ (less than 112)

The case $a = 4$, $m = 4$, $c = 4$ gives the maximum value of 112. Let's verify if there's any other combination that could give a higher value.

Suppose we try $a = 5$, $m = 4$, $c = 3$:
- $5 + 4 + 3 = 12$
- $5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 + 5 \cdot 4 + 4 \cdot 3 + 5 \cdot 3 = 60 + 20 + 12 + 15 = 107$ (less than 112)

Another approach: If we fix one variable and distribute the remaining value between the other two. For example, set $c = 0$:
- Then $a + m = 12$
- The expression becomes $a \cdot m \cdot 0 + a \cdot m + m \cdot 0 + a \cdot 0 = a \cdot m$ which is maximized when $a = m = 6$ giving $6 \cdot 6 = 36$ (not 112)

Similarly, setting $a = 0$ or $m = 0$ gives at most 36.

If we try $c = 1$:
- $a + m = 11$
- The expression becomes $a \cdot m \cdot 1 + a \cdot m + m \cdot 1 + a \cdot 1 = a \cdot m + a \cdot m + m + a = 2 \cdot a \cdot m + a + m$
- This is maximized when $a = m = 5$ (since $5 + 5 = 10$ is close to 11) giving $2 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 + 5 + 5 = 50 + 10 = 60$ (less than 112)

If $c = 2$:
- $a + m = 10$
- The expression becomes $2 \cdot a \cdot m + a + m$
- With $a = m = 5$ we get $2 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 + 5 + 5 = 50 + 10 = 60$ (less than 112)

Continuing this way, we can check that as we distribute the value of 12 among $a, m, c$ symmetrically, the maximum is achieved at $a = m = c = 4$ giving 112.

Now let's see how Lean's proof works. The Lean proof will systematically check all cases where $a + m + c = 12$ with $a, m, c \geq 0$.

The Lean code:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

We're importing the necessary libraries and setting up the environment.

Now we'll define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem amc12_2000_p12 (a m c : ℕ) (h₀ : a + m + c = 12) :
    a * m * c + a * m + m * c + a * c ≤ 112 := by
```

We have the theorem statement with $a, m, c$ as natural numbers and the constraint $a + m + c = 12$. We need to prove the inequality.

To prove this, we can use Lean's computation to check all possible cases. Since $a, m, c$ are nonnegative integers summing to 12, there are finitely many cases to check (specifically, $\binom{12 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{14}{2} = 91$ cases).

In Lean, we can proceed as follows:

```tactics
interval_cases a <;> interval_cases m <;> omega
```

This tactic tells Lean to consider all cases for $a$ from 0 to 12, and for each case of $a$, consider all cases for $m$ from 0 to $12 - a$, and then use the omega solver to verify the inequality in each case.

In more detail:
1. `interval_cases a` will generate 13 cases: $a = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 12$
2. For each case of $a$, `interval_cases m` will generate $12 - a + 1$ cases: $m = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 12 - a$
3. For each case of $m$, we have $c = 12 - a - m$ by the constraint $h₀$
4. The omega solver will substitute these values into the inequality and verify it holds

Since we know from algebraic manipulation that the maximum is 112 when $a = m = c = 4$, and all other cases give smaller values, the Lean proof will confirm that 112 is indeed the maximum.

Therefore, the complete Lean proof is:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop
