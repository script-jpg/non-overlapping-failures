-- We can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or analyze the function to find the maximum value.
  -- But in this case, since we're dealing with integers, we can also use a more direct approach.
  -- Let's think about how to maximize the expression a * m * c + a * m + m * c + a * c.
  -- Notice that the expression is symmetric in a, m, and c. This means that permuting the values won't change the result.
  -- So, we can assume without loss of generality that a ≤ m ≤ c.
  -- Now, to maximize the expression, we want to spread out the values as much as possible, since multiplication is more
  -- sensitive to larger values than to smaller ones.
  -- Let's consider the case where a = 0. Then we have m + c = 12, and the expression becomes 0 * m * c + 0 * m + m * c + 0 * c = m * c.
  -- The maximum value of m * c when m + c = 12 is when m = 6 and c = 6, which gives us 36.
  -- This isn't very impressive, so let's consider other cases.
  -- What if a = 1? Then we have m + c = 11, and the expression becomes 1 * m * c + 1 * m + m * c + 1 * c = m * c + m + m * c + c = 2 * m * c + m + c.
  -- To maximize this, we want to maximize m * c with m + c = 11. The maximum occurs when m = 5, c = 6 (or vice versa), giving us 2 * 5 * 6 + 5 + 6 = 60 + 11 = 71.
  -- Still not very impressive. Let's try a = 2.
  -- Then we have m + c = 10, and the expression becomes 2 * m * c + 2 * m + m * c + 2 * c = 3 * m * c + 2 * m + 2 * c.
  -- To maximize this, we want to maximize m * c with m + c = 10. The maximum occurs when m = 5, c = 5, giving us 3 * 5 * 5 + 2 * 5 + 2 * 5 = 75 + 10 + 10 = 95.
  -- Still not impressive enough. Let's try a = 3.
  -- Then we have m + c = 9, and the expression becomes 3 * m * c + 3 * m + m * c + 3 * c = 4 * m * c + 3 * m + 3 * c.
  -- To maximize this, we want to maximize m * c with m + c = 9. The maximum occurs when m = 4, c = 5 (or vice versa), giving us 4 * 4 * 5 + 3 * 4 + 3 * 5 = 80 + 12 + 15 = 107.
  -- Still not enough. Let's try a = 4.
  -- Then we have m + c = 8, and the expression becomes 4 * m * c + 4 * m + m * c + 4 * c = 5 * m * c + 4 * m + 4 * c.
  -- To maximize this, we want to maximize m * c with m + c = 8. The maximum occurs when m = 4, c = 4, giving us 5 * 4 * 4 + 4 * 4 + 4 * 4 = 80 + 16 + 16 = 112. This is the answer!
  -- So the maximum value is 112, achieved when a = 4, m = 4, c = 4.
  -- Let's formalize this in Lean 4.

  -- We'll use the method of case analysis on the value of a.
