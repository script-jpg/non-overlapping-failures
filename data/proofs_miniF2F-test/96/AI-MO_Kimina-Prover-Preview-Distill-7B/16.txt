-- We need to consider all possible values of $A$, $M$, and $C$ such that $A + M + C = 12$.
  -- Since $A$, $M$, and $C$ are nonnegative integers, we can analyze different cases for their values.
  -- To find the maximum value of $A \cdot M \cdot C + A \cdot M + M \cdot C + A \cdot C$, we can compare different cases.
  -- One approach is to fix one variable and analyze the resulting expression for different values of the other two variables.

  -- Consider fixing $C = 0$. Then $A + M = 12$ and the expression becomes $A \cdot M \cdot 0 + A \cdot M + M \cdot 0 + A \cdot 0 = A \cdot M$.
  -- Since $A + M = 12$, $A \cdot M \leq 36$ when $A = M = 6$.

  -- Consider fixing $C = 1$. Then $A + M = 11$ and the expression becomes $A \cdot M \cdot 1 + A \cdot M + M \cdot 1 + A \cdot 1 = A \cdot M + A \cdot M + M + A = 2 \cdot A \cdot M + A + M$.
  -- To maximize $2 \cdot A \cdot M + A + M$ when $A + M = 11$, we can try different values. For example, if $A = 5$ and $M = 6$, we get $2 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 + 5 + 6 = 60 + 11 = 71$.
  -- Comparing to the previous case, this is higher.

  -- Consider fixing $C = 2$. Then $A + M = 10$ and the expression becomes $A \cdot M \cdot 2 + A \cdot M + M \cdot 2 + A \cdot 2 = 2 \cdot A \cdot M + A \cdot M + 2 \cdot M + 2 \cdot A = 3 \cdot A \cdot M + 2 \cdot (A + M)$.
  -- Since $A + M = 10$, we need to maximize $3 \cdot A \cdot M + 20$.
  -- For example, if $A = 5$ and $M = 5$, we get $3 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 + 20 = 75 + 20 = 95$.
  -- This is higher than the previous cases.

  -- Consider fixing $C = 3$. Then $A + M = 9$ and the expression becomes $A \cdot M \cdot 3 + A \cdot M + M \cdot 3 + A \cdot 3 = 3 \cdot A \cdot M + A \cdot M + 3 \cdot M + 3 \cdot A = 4 \cdot A \cdot M + 3 \cdot (A + M)$.
  -- Since $A + M = 9$, we need to maximize $4 \cdot A \cdot M + 27$.
  -- If $A = 4$ and $M = 5$, we get $4 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 + 27 = 80 + 27 = 107$.
  -- This is higher than the previous cases.

  -- Now consider $C = 4$. Then $A + M = 8$ and the expression becomes $A \cdot M \cdot 4 + A \cdot M + M \cdot 4 + A \cdot 4 = 4 \cdot A \cdot M + A \cdot M + 4 \cdot M + 4 \cdot A = 5 \cdot A \cdot M + 4 \cdot (A + M)$.
  -- Since $A + M = 8$, we need to maximize $5 \cdot A \cdot M + 32$.
  -- If $A = 4$ and $M = 4$, we get $5 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 + 32 = 80 + 32 = 112$.
  -- This is higher than all previous cases and equals answer choice (E).

  -- To confirm that 112 is indeed the maximum, we can check that for $A = 4$, $M = 4$, $C = 4$:
  -- $A + M + C = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12$ ✓
  -- $A \cdot M \cdot C + A \cdot M + M \cdot C + A \cdot C = 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 + 4 \cdot 4 + 4 \cdot 4 + 4 \cdot 4 = 64 + 16 + 16 + 16 = 112$ ✓

  -- We can formalize this analysis in Lean 4:
  have : a ≤ 12 := by omega
  have : m ≤ 12 := by omega
  have : c ≤ 12 := by omega

  interval_cases a <;> interval_cases m <;> interval_cases c <;> omega
```

In the formal solution, we first establish that $a$, $m$, and $c$ are all bounded by 12 since they are nonnegative integers summing to 12. Then we use `interval_cases` to consider all possible values for each variable. For each case, Lean will generate subgoals, and we use `omega` to solve the arithmetic goals automatically. The key insight is that the maximum occurs when $a = 4$, $m = 4$, and $c = 4$, yielding 112. The formal proof systematically checks all possible cases to verify that 112 is indeed the maximum value.
