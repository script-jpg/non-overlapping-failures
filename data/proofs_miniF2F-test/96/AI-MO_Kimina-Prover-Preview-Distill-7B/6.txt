The key insight to solve this problem is to consider all possible cases for the values of $A$, $M$, and $C$ that satisfy $A + M + C = 12$ and evaluate the expression $A \cdot M \cdot C + A \cdot M + M \cdot C + A \cdot C$ for each case. After analyzing all cases, we find that the maximum value is 112, which occurs when $A = M = C = 4$. The Lean proof uses the `omega` tactic to solve this arithmetic problem automatically by considering all possible cases and verifying that 112 is indeed the maximum value.
