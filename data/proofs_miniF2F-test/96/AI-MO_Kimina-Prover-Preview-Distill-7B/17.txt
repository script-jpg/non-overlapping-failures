The proof above is correct in principle, but it's not very elegant. We can do much better.

First, note that we have $A + M + C = 12$, and we want to maximize the expression $A \cdot M \cdot C + A \cdot M + M \cdot C + A \cdot C$.

Let's think about how to approach this problem systematically.

We have three variables $A, M, C$ that are nonnegative integers summing to 12. The expression involves products of these variables.

One useful observation is that for a fixed sum, the product of numbers is maximized when the numbers are as equal as possible. This is related to the arithmetic mean-geometric mean inequality.

Let's try to apply this to our problem. 

Since we have $A + M + C = 12$, and we want to maximize $A \cdot M \cdot C + A \cdot M + M \cdot C + A \cdot C$.

Notice that $A \cdot M \cdot C$ is the product of all three variables, which is maximized when $A = M = C = 4$ (giving $4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 = 64$), but we also have the sum $A \cdot M + M \cdot C + A \cdot C$ to consider.

Let's compute the value when $A = M = C = 4$:
- $A \cdot M \cdot C = 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 = 64$
- $A \cdot M + M \cdot C + A \cdot C = 4 \cdot 4 + 4 \cdot 4 + 4 \cdot 4 = 16 + 16 + 16 = 48$
- Total = $64 + 48 = 112$

This is one of our answer choices, so it's a strong candidate for the maximum.

But we need to prove it's indeed the maximum. Let's consider other possible distributions of the value 12 among $A, M, C$ to ensure that 112 is the highest possible value.

For example:
- If $A = 5, M = 5, C = 2$: 
  - $5 \cdot 5 \cdot 2 + 5 \cdot 5 + 5 \cdot 2 + 5 \cdot 2 = 50 + 25 + 10 + 10 = 95$
- If $A = 6, M = 3, C = 3$: 
  - $6 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 + 6 \cdot 3 + 3 \cdot 3 + 6 \cdot 3 = 54 + 18 + 9 + 18 = 99$
- If $A = 7, M = 2, C = 3$: 
  - $7 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 + 7 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot 3 + 7 \cdot 3 = 42 + 14 + 6 + 21 = 83$

In all these cases, the value is less than 112.

Another approach is to use the method of Lagrange multipliers or analyze the function using calculus, but since we're working with integers, we can't directly apply those techniques.

However, we can use the fact that for positive integers, if we have a fixed sum, the product is maximized when the integers are as equal as possible. This is because if we have two integers that are far apart, their product is larger than if they're close together, but with the constraint of the sum being fixed.

For the sum 12, the closest integers to 12/3 = 4 would be 4, 4, 4, which as we saw gives the value 112.

Let's prove this more formally in Lean:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

```

Now we'll define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem amc12_2000_p12 (a m c : ℕ) (h₀ : a + m + c = 12) :
    a * m * c + a * m + m * c + a * c ≤ 112 := by
```

Our goal is to show that for any nonnegative integers a, m, c summing to 12, the expression is at most 112.

We could proceed by:
1. Considering all possible values of a, m, c from 0 to 12 with a + m + c = 12
2. For each case, computing the value of the expression
3. Verifying that the maximum is 112

However, since Lean can compute this automatically with the right tactic, we can use `interval_cases` to generate all cases and then use `omega` to solve the arithmetic:

```tactics
interval_cases a <;> interval_cases m <;> omega
```

This tactic will:
1. Consider all possible values of a from 0 to 12
2. For each value of a, consider all possible values of m from 0 to 12 - a
3. For each combination of a and m, determine c = 12 - a - m
4. Compute the value of the expression for each case
5. Verify that it is at most 112

The `interval_cases` tactic is powerful for problems with bounded integer variables, and `omega` can solve arithmetic goals involving natural numbers.

Therefore, our complete proof is:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop
