# Solving the AMC 12 2000 Problem 12

I'll tackle this algebra problem about maximizing $A \cdot M \cdot C + A \cdot M + M \cdot C + A \cdot C$ given that $A + M + C = 12$ where $A, M, C$ are nonnegative integers.

First, let's think about how to approach this problem systematically. We need to consider all possible values of $A$, $M$, and $C$ such that their sum is 12, and find the maximum value of the given expression.

Let's start by setting up our theorem statement:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

Now we'll define the theorem with the given constraint:

```tactics
theorem amc12_2000_p12 (a m c : ℕ) (h₀ : a + m + c = 12) :
    a * m * c + a * m + m * c + a * c ≤ 112 := by
```

Our goal is to prove that for any nonnegative integers $a$, $m$, and $c$ satisfying $a + m + c = 12$, the inequality $a \cdot m \cdot c + a \cdot m + m \cdot c + a \cdot c \leq 112$ holds.

To solve this, I'll analyze all possible values of $a$, $m$, and $c$ that satisfy our constraint. Since they are nonnegative integers, we can use case analysis.

Let's think about how to structure this. For $a + m + c = 12$, $a$ can range from 0 to 12, and for each value of $a$, $m$ can range from 0 to $12 - a$, with $c = 12 - a - m$.

We could proceed by:

1. Case analysis on $a$ from 0 to 12
2. For each case of $a$, case analysis on $m$ from 0 to $12 - a$
3. $c$ is then determined as $12 - a - m$
4. For each combination, compute the value of $a \cdot m \cdot c + a \cdot m + m \cdot c + a \cdot c$
5. Find the maximum value

Let's continue with our proof in Lean:

```tactics
have h₁ : a ≤ 12 := by omega
have h₂ : m ≤ 12 := by omega
have h₃ : c ≤ 12 := by omega
```

Now we've established that each variable is bounded by 12, which makes sense given that they are nonnegative integers summing to 12.

Next, we need to analyze the expression $a \cdot m \cdot c + a \cdot m + m \cdot c + a \cdot c$. Let's try to find some patterns or constraints that can help us narrow down the possibilities.

One useful approach is to consider symmetry. Since the expression is symmetric in $a$, $m$, and $c$ in terms of multiplication, it's often maximized when the values are balanced. For example, if $a = m = c = 4$, then $a \cdot m \cdot c = 64$ which is a significant portion of our total.

Let's check what happens when $a = m = c = 4$:
- $a \cdot m \cdot c = 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 = 64$
- $a \cdot m = 4 \cdot 4 = 16$
- $m \cdot c = 4 \cdot 4 = 16$
- $a \cdot c = 4 \cdot 4 = 16$
- Total: $64 + 16 + 16 + 16 = 112$

Indeed, we get 112, which is one of our answer choices. Since we need to prove that 112 is the maximum, we should check if any other combinations can exceed 112.

To make progress, let's think about how to approach this systematically. Instead of checking all possible combinations (which would be tedious), we can try to find some constraints.

One observation is that for $a \cdot m \cdot c$ to be large, we want $a$, $m$, and $c$ to be roughly equal. This suggests that the maximum is likely when $a = m = c = 4$.

Let's prove this in Lean by checking all possible cases:

```tactics
interval_cases a <;> interval_cases m <;> omega
```

The `interval_cases` tactic will generate all possible cases for $a$ and $m$ within their bounds (0 to 12), and for each case, it will substitute the values into our goal. The `<;>` combinator applies the second tactic (in this case, `interval_cases m`) to all goals generated by the first tactic.

After substituting all possible values, the `omega` tactic can compute the arithmetic expression and verify that the inequality holds in each case.

Since we've established that $a \leq 12$, $m \leq 12$, and $c \leq 12$, and that $a + m + c = 12$, the `interval_cases` tactic will generate all valid combinations, and for each one, `omega` will compute the value of our expression and check that it's at most 112.

Let's reflect on why this approach works. The key insight is that for the product terms to be large, we need the variables to be balanced. When $a = m = c = 4$, we get the maximum product $4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 = 64$, and the other terms $4 \cdot 4 + 4 \cdot 4 + 4 \cdot 4 = 48$ to reach the total of 112.

Any other combination will result in a smaller product term due to the constraint $a + m + c = 12$. For example, if one variable is 5 and another is 5, the third must be 2, which gives $5 \cdot 5 \cdot 2 = 50$, which is less than 64.

Therefore, the maximum value of $A \cdot M \cdot C + A \cdot M + M \cdot C + A \cdot C$ given $A + M + C = 12$ is 112, achieved when $A = M = C = 4$.

The Lean proof is remarkably concise because it's handling all cases systematically. While we could have used some algebraic manipulation to show this more directly, the computational approach is straightforward and ensures that all cases are considered.

# Solving the AMC 12 2000 Problem 12

I'll tackle this algebra problem about maximizing $A \cdot M \cdot C + A \cdot M + M \cdot C + A \cdot C$ given that $A + M + C = 12$ where $A, M, C$ are nonnegative integers.

First, let's think about how to approach this problem systematically. We need to consider all possible values of $A$, $M$, and $C$ such that their sum is 12, and find the maximum value of the given expression.

To solve this, I'll analyze all possible values of $A$, $M$, and $C$ that satisfy $A + M + C = 12$. Since they are nonnegative integers, we can use case analysis.

Let's structure our proof in Lean 4:

```tactics

import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

Now I need to define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem amc12_2000_p12 (a m c : ℕ) (h₀ : a + m + c = 12) :
    a * m * c + a * m + m * c + a * c ≤ 112 := by
```

Our approach will be to use case analysis on all possible values of $a$, $m$, and $c$ that satisfy $a + m + c = 12$. Since they are nonnegative integers, we can bound each variable by 12.

Let's establish these bounds:

```tactics
have h₁ : a ≤ 12 := by omega
have h₂ : m ≤ 12 := by omega
have h₃ : c ≤ 12 := by omega
```

Now, to handle all cases, we can use `interval_cases` to generate cases for each variable:

```tactics
interval_cases a <;> interval_cases m <;> omega
```

This line is powerful. It's expanding all possible values of $a$ from 0 to 12 and for each value of $a$, expanding all possible values of $m$ from 0 to 12. Then, for each combination of $a$ and $m$, it's using `omega` to solve the arithmetic and verify that $a * m * c + a * m + m * c + a * c ≤ 112$ given $a + m + c = 12$.

This approach works because:
1. We've bounded $a$, $m$, and $c$ by 12
2. For each specific value of $a$ and $m$, $c$ is uniquely determined as $12 - a - m$
3. The arithmetic expression can be evaluated for each case to verify it's at most 112

The Lean proof is elegant in its simplicity, as it's leveraging Lean's automation to handle the tedious case analysis that would be required in a manual proof.

Therefore, the maximum value of $A \cdot M \cdot C + A \cdot M + M \cdot C + A \cdot C$ given $A + M + C = 12$ is 112, which is achieved when $A = M = C = 4$.

First, I'll think about some basic observations:
- We need to consider all possible values of $A$, $M$, and $C$ such that their sum is 12.

We need to find the maximum value of $A \cdot M \cdot C + A \cdot M + M \cdot C + A \cdot C$ given that $A + M + C = 12$ where $A, M, C$ are nonnegative integers.

First, let's think about how to approach this problem. One useful strategy is to examine symmetric cases, as the expression is symmetric in $A$, $M$, and $C$.

Let's try $A = M = C = 4$:
- $A \cdot M \cdot C = 4 \cdot 4 \cdot 4 = 64$
- $A \cdot M = 4 \cdot 4 = 16$
- $M \cdot C = 4 \cdot 4 = 16$
- $A \cdot C = 4 \cdot 4 = 16$
- Total: $64 + 16 + 16 + 16 = 112$

Now let's verify if this is indeed the maximum by considering other possible cases.

For instance, if $A = 5$, $M = 5$, and $C = 2$:
- $A \cdot M \cdot C = 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 2 = 50$
- $A \cdot M = 5 \cdot 5 = 25$
- $M \cdot C = 5 \cdot 2 = 10$
- $A \cdot C = 5 \cdot 2 = 10$
- Total: $50 + 25 + 10 + 10 = 95$

Similarly, if $A = 6$, $M = 3$, and $C = 3$:
- $A \cdot M \cdot C = 6 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 = 54$
- $A \cdot M = 6 \cdot 3 = 18$
- $M \cdot C = 3 \cdot 3 = 9$
- $A
