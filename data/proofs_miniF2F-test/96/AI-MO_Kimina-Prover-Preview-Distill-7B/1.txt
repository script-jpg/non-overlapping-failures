-- We set up the problem with three natural number variables a, m, c that sum to 12.
  -- We want to maximize the expression a * m * c + a * m + m * c + a * c.

  -- First, we establish an upper bound. For a, m, c ≤ 12, we can bound the expression.
  have h₁ : a ≤ 12 := by linarith
  have h₂ : m ≤ 12 := by linarith
  have h₃ : c ≤ 12 := by linarith

  -- We can bound a * m * c by 12^3 = 1728, but this is not tight.
  -- We need a better bound for the specific expression.
  have h₄ : a * m * c + a * m + m * c + a * c ≤ 112 := by

    -- Now we need to consider the actual maximization.
    -- Since the variables are natural numbers, we can try all possible combinations.
    -- But we can also reason about it.
    -- If one variable is 0, then the whole expression is 0.
    -- So we need all variables to be positive.
    -- If all variables are equal, then a = m = c = 4.
    -- Then the expression is 4 * 4 * 4 + 4 * 4 + 4 * 4 + 4 * 4 = 64 + 16 + 16 + 16 = 112.
    -- This is a good candidate for the maximum.

    -- Let's formalize this reasoning:
    interval_cases a <;> interval_cases m <;> interval_cases c <;> omega

    -- The tactic `interval_cases` will generate cases for all possible values of a, m, c ≤ 12.
    -- But since a + m + c = 12, we don't need all combinations.
    -- The `omega` tactic will automatically solve the arithmetic goals to verify that 112 is indeed the maximum.

    -- The maximum value of 112 occurs when a = m = c = 4.
