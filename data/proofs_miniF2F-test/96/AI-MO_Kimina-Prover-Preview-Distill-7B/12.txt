-- We need to consider all the possible values of a, m, c such that a + m + c = 12.
  have h₁ : a ≤ 12 := by omega
  have h₂ : m ≤ 12 := by omega
  have h₃ : c ≤ 12 := by omega

  -- We notice that both m and c must be even or both must be odd, since their sum is even.
  have h₄ : (m + c) % 2 = 0 := by omega

  -- Hence, write c = 12 - a - m, and we only need to consider a few cases.
  interval_cases a <;> interval_cases m <;> omega
