  Given two natural numbers, \(a\) and \(b\), we know that their least common multiple (LCM) is 3720 and their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 8. We are also given that one of the numbers is 120. We need to find the other number, which we will show to be 248.
  First, we use the property that the product of the GCD and LCM of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves:
  \[ \text{gcd}(a, b) \times \text{lcm}(a, b) = a \times b \]
  Substituting the known values of GCD and LCM into this equation, we get:
  \[ 8 \times 3720 = 120 \times b \]
  Solving for \(b\), we find:
  \[ b = \frac{8 \times 3720}{120} \]
  Calculating the right-hand side, we find:
  \[ b = 248 \]
  Thus, the other number is indeed 248.
