  Given that the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is 3720 and their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 8, and one of the numbers is 120, we need to find the other number. We are to show that this other number is 248.
  First, we use the property that the product of the GCD and LCM of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. Using this property, we can set up an equation involving the GCD, LCM, and the two numbers.
  Given:
  \[ \text{GCD}(120, b) = 8 \]
  \[ \text{LCM}(120, b) = 3720 \]
  We know that:
  \[ \text{GCD}(120, b) \times \text{LCM}(120, b) = 120 \times b \]
  Substituting the given values into this equation:
  \[ 8 \times 3720 = 120 \times b \]
  Solving for \( b \):
  \[ 29760 = 120 \times b \]
  \[ b = \frac{29760}{120} \]
  \[ b = 248 \]
  Thus, the other number is indeed 248.
