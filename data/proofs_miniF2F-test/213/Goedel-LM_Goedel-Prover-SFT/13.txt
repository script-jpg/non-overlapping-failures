  Given two natural numbers \(a\) and \(b\), we know that their least common multiple (LCM) is 3720 and their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 8. We are also given that one of the numbers is 120. We need to find the other number.
  First, we use the property that the product of the GCD and LCM of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. This property is given by:
  \[
  \text{gcd}(a, b) \times \text{lcm}(a, b) = a \times b
  \]
  Substituting the given values into this equation, we get:
  \[
  8 \times 3720 = 120 \times b
  \]
  Solving for \(b\), we find:
  \[
  b = \frac{8 \times 3720}{120} = 248
  \]
  Thus, the other number is 248.
