  Given two natural numbers \( a \) and \( b \), we know that their least common multiple (LCM) is 3720 and their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 8. We are also given that one of the numbers is 120. We need to find the other number \( b \).
  1. We start by using the property that the product of the GCD and LCM of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves.
  2. Using this property, we can set up an equation involving \( b \).
  3. We simplify the equation to solve for \( b \).
  4. Finally, we verify that the solution \( b = 248 \) satisfies the given conditions.
