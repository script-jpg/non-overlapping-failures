  Given two natural numbers \(a\) and \(b\), we know that their least common multiple (LCM) is 3720 and their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 8. We are also given that \(a = 120\). We need to find the other number \(b\).
  Using the properties of the LCM and GCD, we can express \(b\) in terms of its LCM and GCD with 120. Specifically, we use the fact that:
  \[ \text{lcm}(120, b) \times \text{gcd}(120, b) = 120 \times b \]
  Substituting the known values:
  \[ 3720 \times 8 = 120 \times b \]
  Solving for \(b\):
  \[ 29760 = 120 \times b \]
  \[ b = \frac{29760}{120} \]
  \[ b = 248 \]
  Thus, the other number \(b\) is 248.
