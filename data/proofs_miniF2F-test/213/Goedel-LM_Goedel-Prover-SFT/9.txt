  Given two natural numbers, where one is 120, and their least common multiple (LCM) is 3720, and their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 8, we need to find the other number. We start by using the property that the product of the GCD and LCM of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. Using this property, we can set up an equation involving the GCD and LCM of 120 and the unknown number \( b \). By substituting the known values of the GCD and LCM into this equation, we simplify to find \( b \). Finally, we verify that \( b \) equals 248.

  -- Use the property that the product of the GCD and LCM of 120 and b is equal to the product of 120 and b.
  have h₂ : 120 * b = Nat.gcd 120 b * Nat.lcm 120 b := by
    rw [Nat.gcd_mul_lcm]
  -- Substitute the known values of the GCD and LCM into the equation.
  rw [h₁, h₀] at h₂
  -- Simplify the equation to solve for b.
  norm_num at h₂
  -- Use the omega tactic to solve the resulting linear equation and verify that b = 248.
