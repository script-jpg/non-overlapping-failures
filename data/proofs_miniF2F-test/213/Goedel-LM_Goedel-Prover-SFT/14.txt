  Given that the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers \(120\) and \(b\) is \(3720\), and their greatest common divisor (GCD) is \(8\), we need to find the value of \(b\). We are to show that \(b\) is \(248\).
  1. We start by using the property that the product of the GCD and LCM of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves.
  2. Using the given GCD and LCM, we calculate the product of \(120\) and \(b\).
  3. We simplify the equation to find \(b\).
  4. Finally, we verify that \(b\) equals \(248\).
