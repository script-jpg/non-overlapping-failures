  Given two natural numbers \(a\) and \(b\), we know that their least common multiple (LCM) is 3720 and their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 8. We are also given that one of the numbers is 120. We need to find the other number, which is 248.
  1. We start by using the property that the product of the GCD and LCM of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves.
  2. Using the property \( \text{gcd}(a, b) \times \text{lcm}(a, b) = a \times b \), we substitute the known values: \( 8 \times 3720 = 120 \times b \).
  3. Solving for \( b \), we find \( b = 248 \).
