  Given two natural numbers \( a \) and \( b \), we know that their least common multiple (LCM) is 3720 and their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 8. Additionally, one of the numbers is 120. We need to find the other number \( b \).
  1. We start by using the property that the product of the GCD and LCM of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves.
  2. Using the given GCD and LCM, we calculate the product of 120 and \( b \).
  3. We simplify the equation to find \( b \).
  4. Finally, we verify that \( b \) equals 248.
