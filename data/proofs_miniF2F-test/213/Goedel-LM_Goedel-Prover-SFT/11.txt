  Given that the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers 120 and \( b \) is 3720, and their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 8, we need to find the value of \( b \). We use the property that the product of the LCM and GCD of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. Using this property, we can set up an equation involving \( b \). By simplifying and solving this equation, we find that \( b \) must be 248.
