  Given that the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers \(120\) and \(b\) is \(3720\), and their greatest common divisor (GCD) is \(8\), we need to find the value of \(b\) when one of the numbers is \(120\). We will show that \(b\) is \(248\).
  1. We start by using the property that the product of the GCD and LCM of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves.
  2. Using this property, we can set up an equation involving \(b\).
  3. We simplify the equation using the given values for the GCD and LCM.
  4. Finally, we solve the equation to find the value of \(b\).
