  Given that the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\) is 3720, and their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 8, we need to find the other number \(b\) when one of the numbers is 120. We are to show that \(b\) is 248.
  First, we use the property that the product of the GCD and LCM of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. Specifically, we have:
  \[ \text{gcd}(a, b) \times \text{lcm}(a, b) = a \times b \]
  Given \(\text{gcd}(120, b) = 8\) and \(\text{lcm}(120, b) = 3720\), we substitute these values into the equation:
  \[ 8 \times 3720 = 120 \times b \]
  Calculating the left-hand side:
  \[ 8 \times 3720 = 29760 \]
  Thus, the equation becomes:
  \[ 29760 = 120 \times b \]
  To find \(b\), we divide both sides by 120:
  \[ b = \frac{29760}{120} \]
  Performing the division:
  \[ b = 248 \]
