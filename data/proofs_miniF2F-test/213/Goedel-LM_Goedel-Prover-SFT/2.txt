  Given that the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\) is 3720, and their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 8, we need to find the other number \(b\) given that one of the numbers is 120. We will show that the other number is 248.
  1. We start by using the property that the product of the GCD and LCM of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves.
  2. Using the given GCD and LCM, we calculate the product of the numbers.
  3. We then solve for \(b\) by isolating it in the equation derived from the GCD and LCM.
  4. Finally, we verify that \(b\) equals 248.
