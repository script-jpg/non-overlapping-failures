  Given two natural numbers \(a\) and \(b\), we know that their least common multiple (LCM) is 3720 and their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 8. We are also given that one of the numbers is 120. We need to find the other number, which we will show to be 248.
  First, we use the property that the product of the LCM and GCD of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. Using this property, we can set up an equation involving \(a\) and \(b\).
  Next, we substitute the known values of the LCM and GCD into the equation. Simplifying this equation will allow us to solve for the unknown number.
  Finally, we verify that the solution satisfies the given conditions.

  -- Use the property that the product of the LCM and GCD of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers.
  have h₂ := Nat.gcd_mul_lcm 120 b
  -- Substitute the known values of the LCM and GCD into the equation.
  simp_all only [mul_comm]
  -- Simplify the equation to solve for the unknown number.
  -- The equation now is 120 * b = 8 * 3720.
  -- Solving for b, we get b = (8 * 3720) / 120 = 248.
