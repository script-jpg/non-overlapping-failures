  Given two natural numbers, where one is 120, and their least common multiple (LCM) is 3720, and their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 8, we need to find the other number. We are to show that the other number is 248.
  1. We start by using the property that the product of the GCD and LCM of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves.
  2. Substitute the known values of the GCD and LCM into the equation.
  3. Simplify the equation using the known values.
  4. Solve for the unknown number using basic arithmetic operations.
