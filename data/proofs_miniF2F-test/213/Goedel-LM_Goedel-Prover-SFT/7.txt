  Given that the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers is 3720 and their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 8, and one of the numbers is 120, we need to find the other number. We are to show that this other number is 248.
  First, we use the property that the product of the GCD and LCM of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. Specifically, for any two natural numbers \(a\) and \(b\), we have:
  \[ \text{gcd}(a, b) \times \text{lcm}(a, b) = a \times b \]
  Applying this property to our specific case where \(a = 120\) and \(b = b\), we get:
  \[ 8 \times 3720 = 120 \times b \]
  Solving for \(b\), we find:
  \[ b = \frac{8 \times 3720}{120} \]
  Simplifying the right-hand side:
  \[ b = 248 \]
  Thus, the other number is indeed 248.

  have h₂ := Nat.gcd_mul_lcm 120 b
  -- Substitute the known values of GCD and LCM into the equation.
  rw [h₁, h₀] at h₂
  -- Solve for b using the equation 8 * 3720 = 120 * b.
  have h₃ : b = 248 := by linarith
  -- The result b = 248 is the desired solution.
