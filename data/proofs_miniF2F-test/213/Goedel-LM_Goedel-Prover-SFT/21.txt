  Given that the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\) is 3720, and their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 8, we need to find the other number \(b\) given that one of the numbers is 120. We are to show that \(b\) is 248.
  1. We start with the property that the product of the GCD and LCM of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves.
  2. Using this property, we can set up an equation involving \(b\).
  3. We simplify the equation using numerical values and properties of the GCD and LCM.
  4. Finally, we solve for \(b\) and verify that it equals 248.
