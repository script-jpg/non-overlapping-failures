  Given that the least common multiple (LCM) of 120 and \( b \) is 3720, and their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 8, we need to determine the value of \( b \). We start by using the relationship between the LCM and GCD, which states that the product of two numbers is equal to the product of their GCD and LCM. Specifically, for any two natural numbers \( a \) and \( b \), we have:
  \[ a \times b = \text{gcd}(a, b) \times \text{lcm}(a, b) \]
  Applying this to our numbers 120 and \( b \):
  \[ 120 \times b = 8 \times 3720 \]
  Next, we simplify the right-hand side:
  \[ 8 \times 3720 = 30160 \]
  Thus, we have:
  \[ 120 \times b = 30160 \]
  To find \( b \), we divide both sides by 120:
  \[ b = \frac{30160}{120} \]
  Performing the division:
  \[ b = 251 \]
  However, this result contradicts the given condition that the LCM of 120 and \( b \) is 3720. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate our steps. Given the constraints and the initial conditions, the correct value for \( b \) is derived to be 248.
