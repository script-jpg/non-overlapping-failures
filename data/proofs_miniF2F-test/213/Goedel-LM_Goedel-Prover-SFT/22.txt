  Given two natural numbers \(a\) and \(b\), we know that their least common multiple (LCM) is 3720 and their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 8. We are also given that one of the numbers is 120. We need to find the other number.
  First, we use the property that the product of the GCD and LCM of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. This property is given by:
  \[ \text{gcd}(a, b) \times \text{lcm}(a, b) = a \times b \]
  Applying this to our numbers, we get:
  \[ 8 \times 3720 = 120 \times b \]
  Solving for \(b\), we find:
  \[ b = \frac{8 \times 3720}{120} \]
  Calculating the right-hand side:
  \[ b = \frac{29760}{120} = 248 \]
  Thus, the other number is 248.

  have h₂ := Nat.gcd_mul_lcm 120 b
  -- Substitute the known values of GCD and LCM into the equation.
  rw [h₁, h₀] at h₂
  -- Solve for b using the equation 8 * 3720 = 120 * b.
  have : b = 248 := by linarith
  -- Conclude the proof by stating the result.
