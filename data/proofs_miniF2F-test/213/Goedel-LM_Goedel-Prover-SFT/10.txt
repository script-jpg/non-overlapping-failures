  Given two natural numbers \(a\) and \(b\), we know that their least common multiple (LCM) is 3720 and their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 8. We are also given that one of the numbers is 120. We need to find the other number \(b\).
  Using the properties of the LCM and GCD, we have:
  \[ \text{LCM}(120, b) \times \text{GCD}(120, b) = 120 \times b \]
  Substituting the known values:
  \[ 3720 \times 8 = 120 \times b \]
  Solving for \(b\):
  \[ 3720 \times 8 = 120 \times b \]
  \[ 29760 = 120 \times b \]
  \[ b = \frac{29760}{120} \]
  \[ b = 248 \]
  Thus, the other number \(b\) is 248.
