  Given that the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\) is 3720, and their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 8, we need to find the other number \(b\) given that one of the numbers is 120. We will show that \(b\) is 248.
  1. We start by using the property that the product of the GCD and LCM of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves.
  2. Substitute the known values of GCD and LCM into the equation.
  3. Simplify the equation to find the value of \(b\).

  -- Use the property that the product of the GCD and LCM of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves.
  have h₂ : 120 * b = Nat.gcd 120 b * Nat.lcm 120 b := by rw [Nat.gcd_mul_lcm]
  -- Substitute the known values of GCD and LCM into the equation.
  rw [h₁, h₀] at h₂
  -- Simplify the equation to find the value of b.
  norm_num at h₂
  -- Solve for b using the simplified equation.
