  Given that the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\) is 3720, and their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 8, we need to find the value of \(b\) given that one of the numbers is 120. We will show that the other number \(b\) is 248.
  1. We start by using the property that the product of the GCD and LCM of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves.
  2. Using this property, we can set up an equation involving \(b\).
  3. Substitute the known values of the GCD and LCM into the equation.
  4. Solve for \(b\) using basic arithmetic operations.
