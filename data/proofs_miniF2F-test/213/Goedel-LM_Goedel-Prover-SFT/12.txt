  Given two natural numbers, 120 and \( b \), we know that their least common multiple (LCM) is 3720 and their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 8. We need to find the value of \( b \).
  First, we use the property that the product of the GCD and LCM of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. Using this property, we can set up an equation involving \( b \).
  Next, we simplify the equation by calculating the product of 120 and \( b \), and then dividing by the GCD of 120 and \( b \). This step allows us to solve for \( b \) directly.
  Finally, we verify that the solution \( b = 248 \) satisfies the original conditions.
