  have h₃ : b = 248 := by

    -- We know that for two numbers $a$ and $b$, the product of their greatest common divisor and least common multiple equals the product of the numbers themselves: $\gcd(a, b) \cdot \mathrm{lcm}(a, b) = a \cdot b$.
    -- Using this relationship, we can find $b$ by calculating $b = \frac{\gcd(120, b) \cdot \mathrm{lcm}(120, b)}{120} = \frac{8 \cdot 3720}{120} = 248$.

    -- According to the properties of the least common multiple, the least common multiple of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers divided by their greatest common divisor: $\mathrm{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \cdot b}{\gcd(a, b)}$.
    -- Therefore, we can also derive $b = \frac{\gcd(120, b) \cdot \mathrm{lcm}(120, b)}{120} = \frac{8 \cdot 3720}{120} = 248$.
