This proof is correct and solves the problem. The other number is indeed 248.

The key insight in this problem is the relationship between the greatest common divisor (GCD) and least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers. For any two natural numbers $a$ and $b$, the following formula holds:

$$\text{gcd}(a,b) \times \text{lcm}(a,b) = a \times b$$

In this problem, we have:

- $\text{lcm}(120,b) = 3720$
- $\text{gcd}(120,b) = 8$
- $120 \times b = 8 \times 3720$
- $120 \times b = 29760$
- $b = \frac{29760}{120} = 248$

Therefore, the other number is 248.

/- The least common multiple of two numbers is 3720, and their greatest common divisor is 8. Given that one of the numbers is 120, what is the other number? Show that it is 248.-/
