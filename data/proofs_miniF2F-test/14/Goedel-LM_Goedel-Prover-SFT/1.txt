  To solve the given expression \(\frac{100^2 - 7^2}{70^2 - 11^2} \cdot \frac{(70-11)(70+11)}{(100-7)(100+7)}\), we can use the difference of squares formula. The difference of squares formula states that \(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\). Applying this formula to both the numerator and the denominator, we get:
  \[
  \frac{(100 - 7)(100 + 7)}{(70 - 11)(70 + 11)} \cdot \frac{(70 - 11)(70 + 11)}{(100 - 7)(100 + 7)}
  \]
  Notice that the terms \((100 - 7)(100 + 7)\) and \((70 - 11)(70 + 11)\) are identical in the numerator and denominator, respectively. Thus, the expression simplifies to:
  \[
  \frac{(100 - 7)(100 + 7)}{(70 - 11)(70 + 11)} \cdot \frac{(70 - 11)(70 + 11)}{(100 - 7)(100 + 7)} = 1
  \]

  -- Use the difference of squares formula to simplify the expression.
  -- The difference of squares formula is a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b).
  -- Applying this formula to both the numerator and the denominator, we get:
  -- (100 - 7)(100 + 7) / (70 - 11)(70 + 11) * (70 - 11)(70 + 11) / (100 - 7)(100 + 7).
  -- Notice that the terms (100 - 7)(100 + 7) and (70 - 11)(70 + 11) are identical in the numerator and denominator, respectively.
  -- Thus, the expression simplifies to:
  -- (100 - 7)(100 + 7) / (70 - 11)(70 + 11) * (70 - 11)(70 + 11) / (100 - 7)(100 + 7) = 1.
