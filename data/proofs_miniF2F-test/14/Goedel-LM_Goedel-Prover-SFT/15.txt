  To solve the given expression, we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately. The numerator is \(100^2 - 7^2\), which can be factored as \((100 - 7)(100 + 7)\). The denominator is \(70^2 - 11^2\), which can be factored as \((70 - 11)(70 + 11)\).
  Next, we substitute these factorizations into the original expression:
  \[
  \frac{(100 - 7)(100 + 7)}{(70 - 11)(70 + 11)}
  \]
  We then simplify the expression by canceling common terms in the numerator and the denominator. Notice that \(100 - 7 = 93\) and \(100 + 7 = 107\). Thus, the expression becomes:
  \[
  \frac{(93)(107)}{(70 - 11)(70 + 11)}
  \]
  Simplifying further, we get:
  \[
  \frac{(93)(107)}{(69)(71)}
  \]
  Since \(93\) and \(71\) are consecutive integers, we can simplify the fraction:
  \[
  \frac{93}{69} = \frac{107}{71}
  \]
  Finally, we observe that:
  \[
  \frac{107}{71} = 1
  \]
  Thus, the value of the expression is \(1\).
