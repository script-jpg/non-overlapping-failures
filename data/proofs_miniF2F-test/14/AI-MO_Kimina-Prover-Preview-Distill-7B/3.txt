-- We are asked to find the value of the expression $\frac{100^2-7^2}{70^2-11^2} \cdot \frac{(70-11)(70+11)}{(100-7)(100+7)}$.

  -- We can use difference of squares formula $a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b)$ to factor each difference of squares in the expression.
  have eq1 : (100 ^ 2 - 7 ^ 2 : ℝ) = (100 - 7) * (100 + 7) := by ring
  have eq2 : (70 ^ 2 - 11 ^ 2 : ℝ) = (70 - 11) * (70 + 11) := by ring

  -- Substituting these factorizations into the expression, we see that all terms cancel out.
