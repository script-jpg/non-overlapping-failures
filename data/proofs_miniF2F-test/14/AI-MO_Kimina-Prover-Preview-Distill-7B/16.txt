-- We will show that the expression equals 1 by simplifying it algebraically.

  -- The original expression is:
  -- (100^2 - 7^2) / (70^2 - 11^2) * ((70 - 11) * (70 + 11) / ((100 - 7) * (100 + 7)))

  -- First, note that we can factor the differences of squares in the fractions:
  -- a^2 - b^2 = (a - b) * (a + b)

  -- Applying this to the first fraction:
  -- (100^2 - 7^2) = (100 - 7) * (100 + 7)
  -- (70^2 - 11^2) = (70 - 11) * (70 + 11)

  -- So the expression becomes:
  -- ((100 - 7) * (100 + 7)) / ((70 - 11) * (70 + 11)) * ((70 - 11) * (70 + 11) / ((100 - 7) * (100 + 7)))

  -- We can see that all terms cancel out:
  -- (100 - 7) in the numerator and denominator
  -- (100 + 7) in the numerator and denominator
  -- (70 - 11) in the numerator and denominator
  -- (70 + 11) in the numerator and denominator

  -- So we are left with 1.
