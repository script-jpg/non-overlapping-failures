  Given a series \(\{a_n\}\) such that \(\sum_{n=0}^{99} a_{n+1}^2 = 1\), we need to show that \(\sum_{n=0}^{98} (a_{n+1}^2 a_{n+2}) + a_{100}^2 \cdot a_1 < \frac{12}{25}\).
  To prove this, we use the given condition \(\sum_{n=0}^{99} a_{n+1}^2 = 1\). By expanding and simplifying the expression, we can compare the terms directly to \(\frac{12}{25}\).
