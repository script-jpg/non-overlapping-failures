  Given the series \(\{a_n\}\) with the property \(\sum_{n=0}^{99} a_{n+1}^2 = 1\), we need to show that \(\sum_{n=0}^{98} (a_{n+1}^2 a_{n+2}) + a_{100}^2 * a_1 < \frac{12}{25}\).
  1. Start by simplifying the given sum \(\sum_{n=0}^{99} a_{n+1}^2 = 1\).
  2. Use the fact that the sum of squares of the series is 1 to bound the terms in the expression.
  3. Apply the non-negativity of squares to derive the desired inequality.
