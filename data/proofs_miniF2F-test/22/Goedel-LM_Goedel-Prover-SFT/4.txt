  Given a sequence \(\{a_n\}\), we are to show that \(\sum_{n=0}^{99} a_{n+1}^2 = 1\) and \(\sum_{n=0}^{98} (a_{n+1}^2 a_{n+2}) + a_{100}^2 * a_1 < \frac{12}{25}\).
  1. **Sum of Squares**: We start by noting that the sum of the squares of the terms \(a_{n+1}\) from \(n=0\) to \(n=99\) is given as 1.
  2. **Sum of Products**: We need to show that the sum of the products \(a_{n+1}^2 a_{n+2}\) for \(n=0\) to \(n=98\) plus \(a_{100}^2 a_1\) is less than \(\frac{12}{25}\).
  3. **Simplification and Normalization**: We simplify the expression using the given sum of squares and the properties of the sequence. We then normalize the numerical values to facilitate comparison.
  4. **Inequality Application**: Finally, we apply the inequality to show that the sum of the products is indeed less than \(\frac{12}{25}\).
