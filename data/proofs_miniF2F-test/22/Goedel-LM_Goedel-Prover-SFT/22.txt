  Given a series \(\{a_n\}\) such that \(\sum_{n=0}^{99} a_{n+1}^2 = 1\), we need to show that \(\sum_{n=0}^{98} (a_{n+1}^2 a_{n+2}) + a_{100}^2 * a_1 < \frac{12}{25}\).
  1. Start by normalizing the given condition \(\sum_{n=0}^{99} a_{n+1}^2 = 1\).
  2. Simplify the expression using basic arithmetic operations.
  3. Apply the properties of sums and inequalities to derive the desired result.
