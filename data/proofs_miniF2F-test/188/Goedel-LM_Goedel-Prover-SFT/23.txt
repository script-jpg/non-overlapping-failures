  To solve the given problem, we need to evaluate the expression \((3x - 2)(4x + 1) - (3x - 2)4x + 1\) when \(x = 4\). We will use the distributive property to expand and simplify the expression step by step.
  1. Substitute \(x = 4\) into the expression.
  2. Expand the terms using the distributive property.
  3. Combine like terms and simplify the expression.
  4. Verify that the final result matches the given options.

  -- Expand the terms using the distributive property.
  -- (3 * 4 - 2) * (4 * 4 + 1) - (3 * 4 - 2) * (4 * 4) + 1
  -- = (12 - 2) * (16 + 1) - (12 - 2) * 16 + 1
  -- = 10 * 17 - 10 * 16 + 1
  -- = 170 - 160 + 1
  -- = 11
