  To solve the expression \((3x - 2)(4x + 1) - (3x - 2)4x + 1\) when \(x = 4\), we proceed as follows:
  1. Substitute \(x = 4\) into the expression.
  2. Simplify the expression step by step.
  3. Verify that the simplified result matches the given choices.

  -- Substitute x = 4 into the expression and simplify using norm_num.
  norm_num [h₀, sub_mul, mul_sub]
  -- The norm_num tactic will simplify the expression and verify that it equals 11.
