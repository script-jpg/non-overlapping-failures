  To solve the expression \((3x - 2)(4x + 1) - (3x - 2)4x + 1\) when \(x = 4\), we proceed as follows:
  1. Substitute \(x = 4\) into the expression.
  2. Simplify the expression step by step.
  First, substitute \(x = 4\) into the expression:
  \[
  (3 \cdot 4 - 2)(4 \cdot 4 + 1) - (3 \cdot 4 - 2) \cdot 4 + 1
  \]
  Calculate the values inside the parentheses:
  \[
  3 \cdot 4 = 12 \quad \text{and} \quad 12 - 2 = 10
  \]
  \[
  4 \cdot 4 = 16 \quad \text{and} \quad 16 + 1 = 17
  \]
  Now, substitute these values back into the expression:
  \[
  (10)(17) - (10)(4) + 1
  \]
  Calculate the products:
  \[
  10 \cdot 17 = 170 \quad \text{and} \quad 10 \cdot 4 = 40
  \]
  Substitute these results back into the expression:
  \[
  170 - 40 + 1
  \]
  Perform the subtraction and addition:
  \[
  170 - 40 = 130 \quad \text{and} \quad 130 + 1 = 131
  \]
  Thus, the value of the expression when \(x = 4\) is \(131\).
