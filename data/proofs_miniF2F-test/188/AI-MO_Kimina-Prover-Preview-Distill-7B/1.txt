-- Substituting $x = 4$ yields $11$.
  subst x
  rfl
```

Let me explain what's happening in this solution:

1. We begin by importing the necessary libraries and setting up the theorem statement:
```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

```

These imports give us access to Lean's mathematical libraries and automated reasoning capabilities.

2. The theorem statement formalizes our problem:
```tactics
theorem amc12b_2002_p2 (x : ℤ) (h₀ : x = 4) :
    (3 * x - 2) * (4 * x + 1) - (3 * x - 2) * (4 * x) + 1 = 11 := by
```

This declares a theorem that takes an integer `x` and a hypothesis `h₀` stating `x = 4`. The theorem claims that the given expression equals 11.

3. The proof strategy is straightforward: we substitute `x = 4` and compute the value:
```tactics
subst x
rfl
```

The `subst x` tactic substitutes `x` with `4` throughout the goal, using our hypothesis `h₀`. After substitution, the goal becomes to prove that the numeric expression equals 11.

The `rfl` (reflexivity) tactic then automatically computes the value of the expression. It expands as follows:
- $(3 \cdot 4 - 2)(4 \cdot 4 + 1) - (3 \cdot 4 - 2) \cdot (4 \cdot 4) + 1$
- $= (12 - 2)(16 + 1) - (12 - 2) \cdot 16 + 1$
- $= 10 \cdot 17 - 10 \cdot 16 + 1$
- $= 170 - 160 + 1$
- $= 11$

So indeed, when $x = 4$, the value of the expression is 11, confirming the answer is (D) 11.

This Lean proof is elegant in its simplicity, directly substituting the value of $x$ and using Lean's computation capabilities to verify the result.
