-- Solution 1 by [cxsmi](https://artofproblemsolving.comhttps://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/User:Cxsmi)

  --$2+3=3^1+2^1=3^1-2^1+2\cdot3^0+2\cdot2^0=3^{1}2^{0}+3^{0}2^{1}+2\cdot3^{0}+2\cdot2^{0}.$Here's a
  --generalization of this:
  --If we have a product $(x_1+y_1)(x_2+y_2)\cdots(x_n+y_n)$, by expanding we get
  --\[x_1x_2\cdots x_n + x_1x_2\cdots y_i + x_1x_2y_i\cdots y_j + \cdots + y_1y_2\cdots y_n\]
  --This is $\sum_{k=0}^{n} \sum_{i_1,i_2,\ldots,i_k=1}^{n} x_{i_1}x_{i_2}\cdots x_{i_k}y_{j_1}y_{j_2}\cdots
  --y_{j_{n-k}}.$

  --Now we notice that the expression we are trying to expand has a very regular structure. If we
  --set $x_i=2^{2^i}$ and $y_i=3^{2^i}$, then we notice that we can expand a product of $x_i$'s and
  --$y_i$'s by splitting the $x_i$'s into sums of lower powers of $x_i$'s. For example:
  --$x_0x_1=x_0(x_0+y_0)=x_0^2+x_0y_0=x_0^2+x_0y_0+y_0^2-y_0^2=(x_0+y_0)(x_0+y_1)+x_0y_1-x_1y_0-y_0^2$,
  --where $x_1=x_0+y_0$. Continuing in this way we see that
  --$\prod_{i=0}^n (x_i + y_i) = \sum_{i=0}^{2^n-1} \prod_{j=0}^n (x_j + y_{i \oplus j})$,
  --where $\oplus$ is bit-wise exclusive or.
  --Using $x_i = 2^{2^i}$ and $y_i = 3^{2^i}$ we get
  --$\prod_{i=0}^n (2^{2^i} + 3^{2^i}) = \sum_{i=0}^{2^n-1} \prod_{j=0}^n (2^{2^j} + 3^{2^j})$.
  --This is almost true, but not quite. We have to account for the overcounting, which gives us the
  --" extra terms" $2\cdot3^{2^i}$ and $3\cdot2^{2^i}$.

  --The problem asks for the product $(2+3)(2^2+3^2)(2^4+3^4)(2^8+3^8)(2^{16}+3^{16})(2^{32}+3^{32})(2^{64}+3^{64})$.
  --We notice that we can start with $(2+3)(2^2+3^2)$ and repeatedly apply the identity
  --$(x+1)(x^2+1)(x^4+1)(x^8+1)\cdots(x^{2^n}+1) = x^{2^{n+1}}-1$ (the $x$ is actually 3 in our case).
  --First, we see that
  --$\prod_{i=0}^3 (2^{2^i} + 3^{2^i}) = (2+3)(2^2+3^2)(2^4+3^4) = (3+2)(3^2+2^2)(3^4+2^4) = 3^8-2^8$.
  --Continuing in this way we see that
  --$\prod_{i=0}^7 (2^{2^i} + 3^{2^i}) = 3^{128}-2^{128}$, which is our answer.

  --Solution 2 by [cxsmi](https://artofproblemsolving.comhttps://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/User:Cxsmi)

  --We notice that the solution is $(3+2)(3^2+2^2)(3^4+2^4)(3^8+2^8)(3^{16}+2^{16})(3^{32}+2^{32})(3^{64}+2^{64})$
  --and think that the solution is $(3-2)(3+2)(3^2+2^2)(3^4+2^4)(3^8+2^8)(3^{16}+2^{16})(3^{32}+2^{32})(3^{64}+2^{64})$
  --$= 3^{128} - 2^{128}$, because we notice that the difference of squares can be used to show that
  --$(3-2)(3^2+2^2)(3^4+2^4)... = 3^{2^k} - 2^{2^k}$ in general.

  --Solution 3 by [Yiyj1](https://artofproblemsolving.comhttps://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/User:Yiyj1)

  --Solution 2 can be simplified further. The solution is
  --$\left(3^{2^0}+2^{2^0}\right)\left(3^{2^1}+2^{2^1}\right)\left(3^{2^2}+2^{2^2}\right)\ldots\left(3^{2^6}+2^{2^6}\right)$
  --and we think it is $(3-2)\left(3^{2^0}+2^{2^0}\right)\left(3^{2^1}+2^{2^1}\right)\ldots$ (as written in Solution 2)
  --$= 3^{2^7} - 2^{2^7} = 3^{128} - 2^{128}$  by the difference of squares factorization.

  --Solution 4 by [MRENTHUSIASM](https://artofproblemsolving.comhttps://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/User:Mrenth usiacm)

  -- solution 2 gives the equation
  -- $\left(3-2\right)\left(3^{2^0}+2^{2^0}\right)\left(3^{2^1}+2^{2^1}\right)\left(3^{2^2}+2^{2^2}\right) \dots \left(3^{2^6}+2^{2^6}\right) = 3^{2^7} - 2^{2^7}$
  -- and asks us to find
  -- $\left(3^{2^0}+2^{2^0}\right)\left(3^{2^1}+2^{2^1}\right)\left(3^{2^2}+2^{2^2}\right) \dots \left(3^{2^6}+2^{2^6}\right)$
  -- so we can divide the equation by $(3 - 2)$ to get the answer $3^{128} - 2^{128} \Longrightarrow \boxed{C}$

  -- Solution 5 by [JHawk02](https://artofproblemsolving.comhttps://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/User:jHawk02)

  -- This is equivalent to Solution 4, but written in a more competition-friendly form.
  -- We can start with the one step difference of squares, and then repeatedly apply it.
  -- $3^{2^k} - 2^{2^k} = (3 - 2)(3^{2^k} + 2^{2^k}) = (3 - 2)(3^{2^k} - 2^{2^k} + 2^{2^k} + 3^{2^k}) = (3 - 2)(3^{2^k} - 2^{2^k} + 3^{2^k} + 2^{2^k})$
  -- We then proceed by induction, assuming the difference of squares formula holds for $k-1$,
  -- and show it holds for $k$.
  -- We have $(3 - 2)(3^{2^k} - 2^{2^k} + 3^{2^k} + 2^{2^k}) = (3 - 2)(3^{2^k} - 2^{2^k}) + (3 - 2)(3^{2^k} + 2^{2^k}) = (3 - 2)(3^{2^k} - 2^{2^k}) + (3^{2^{k + 1}} - 2^{2^{k + 1}})
  -- by our inductive hypothesis, so the formula holds for $k$ if it holds for $k - 1$.
  -- Since $3^{2^k} - 2^{2^k}$ is true for $k = 1$, it is true for all $k$, and we can apply it to
  -- find that the answer is $3^{2^7} - 2^{2^7} = 3^{128} - 2^{128} \Longrightarrow \boxed{C}$

  -- Generalization of the problem: For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, find $\prod_{i=0}^{n} (2^{2^i} + 3^{2^i})$
  -- Answer: $3^{2^{n+1}} - 2^{2^{n+1}}$
  -- Proof: Apply strong induction on $n$
  -- Base case: $n = 0$: True, because $(2 + 3) = 3^2 - 2^2$
  -- Inductive step: Suppose true for $n = i$. Prove for $n = i + 1$
  -- $\prod_{i=0}^{i+1} (2^{2^i} + 3^{2^i}) = (\prod_{i=0}^{i} (2^{2^i} + 3^{2^i})) (2^{2^{i+1}} + 3^{2^{i+1}})
  -- By the inductive hypothesis, we can replace the first part with $3^{2^{i+1}} - 2^{2^{i+1}}$
  -- then multiply it by $2^{2^{i+1}} + 3^{2^{i+1}}$ to get $(3^{2^{i+1}} - 2^{2^{i+1}})(2^{2^{i+1}} + 3^{2^{i+1}})
  -- = $3^{2^{i+2}} - 2^{2^{i+2}}$, which is what we needed to prove.

  -- Solution 6 by [Yiyj1](https://artofproblemsolving.comhttps://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/User:Yiyj1)

  -- Solution 4 gives the equation $(3 - 2)(3^{2^k} + 2^{2^k}) = 3^{2^{k+1}} - 2^{2^{k+1}}$
  -- divided by $3 - 2$ on both sides gives us $3^{2^k} + 2^{2^k} = 3^{2^{k+1}} - 2^{2^{k+1}})/ (3 - 2)$
  -- we can then substitute this into the original equation and get $(3^{2^{7}} - 2^{2^{7}})/(3 - 2)$
  -- which equals $3^{128} - 2^{128}$, and we can divide this by $3 - 2$ to get our answer of
  -- $3^{128} - 2^{128}$, which is answer $\boxed{C}$

  -- Solution 7 by [Yiyj1](https://artofproblemsolving.comhttps://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/User:Yiyj1)

  -- Solution 6 gives the equation $(3 - 2)(3^{2^k} + 2^{2^k}) = 3^{2^{k+1}} - 2^{2^{k+1}})
  -- We divide both sides by $(3 - 2)$ to get $3^{2^k} + 2^{2^k} = (3^{2^{k+1}} - 2^{2^{k+1}})/ (3 - 2)$
  -- We can then substitute this into the original equation to get a big fraction.
  -- However, notice that in the original equation, we multiply the $(3 - 2)$ with the $(3^{2^k} + 2^{2^k})$
  -- terms, so we can substitute this equation in the other direction to get that the product
  -- equals the product of all the $(3^{2^{k}} - 2^{2^{k}})$ terms, multiplied by $(3 - 2)$.
  -- We can then note that we have a telescope product! Indeed, we see that
  -- $\prod_{i=0}^{n} (3^{2^i} - 2^{2^i}) = (3 - 2)(3^2 - 2^2)(3^4 - 2^4)\cdots(3^{2^n} - 2^{2^n})$
  -- $= (3 - 2)(3^2 + 2^2)(3^4 + 2^4)\cdots(3^{2^n} + 2^{2^n})$
  -- $= (3 - 2)(3^2 - 2^2)(3^4 - 2^4)\cdots(3^{2^n} - 2^{2^n})$
  -- We can never get the exact value of this product, but we can get very close by applying the
  -- equation we derived from Solution 6 repeatedly.
  -- We see that we can replace the $(3^{2^{6}} - 2^{2^{6}})$ term with $(3 - 2)$ multiplied by
  -- $(3^{2^5} + 2^{2^5})$ essentially in the same way we did in Solution 6.
  -- We can then keep going all the way back to $(3 - 2)(3 + 2)$, and then multiply this by
  -- the remaining product of $(3^{2^i} + 2^{2^i})$ terms to get the exact value the problem asks
  -- for, namely, $(3 - 2)(3 + 2)(3^2 + 2^2)(3^4 + 2^4)(3^8 + 2^8)(3^{16} + 2^{16})(3^{32} + 2^{32})(3^{64} + 2^{64})$,
  -- which we can simplify using the difference of squares to get the answer:
  -- $3^{128} - 2^{128}$, as required.

  -- Thus, we see that the answer is $3^{128} - 2^{128}$, and so the answer is $\boxed{C}$

  -- Solutions 8, 9, and 10 by [Yiyj1](https://artofproblemsolving.comhttps://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/User:Yiyj1)

  -- Solution 8 is the exact same as Solution 4, except we don't factor the $3 - 2$ term
  -- at the end, and instead we can see that the difference of squares factorization gives us the
  -- solvable equation $(3 - 2)(3^2+2^2)(3^4+2^4)(3^8+2^8)(3^{16}+2^{16})(3^{32}+2^{32})(3^{64}+2^{64}) = 3^{128} - 2^{128}$,
  -- and since we know that the solution is a sum of $2$ multiplied by a power of $6$, we can guess
  -- the answer is $3^{128} - 2^{128}$, and then check for the correct answer.

  --Solution 9 is the exact same as Solution 4, but instead of factoring the difference of squares,
  -- we can also note that $(3 - 2)(3^2+2^2) = 3^{2^2} - 2^{2^2}$, and then continue on by repeatedly
  -- applying the difference of squares factorization to get the answer.

  -- Solution 10 is the exact same as Solution 9, but instead of hand-counting the number of times
  -- we multiply by $(3 - 2)$ in the chain of difference of squares, we note that the formula
  -- $\prod_{i=0}^n (3^{2^i} - 2^{2^i}) = (3 - 2)^{n+1} (3^{2^{n+1}} + 2^{2^{n+1}})$, so plugging in
  -- $n = 6$ gives us the answer.

  -- Solutions 11 and 12 give a different solution to the problem, but also arrive at the answer
  -- $3^{128} - 2^{128}$.

  -- Solution 11 gives a recursive formula for the solution, which can be proven by induction.
  -- We let $f(n) = \prod_{i=0}^n (2
