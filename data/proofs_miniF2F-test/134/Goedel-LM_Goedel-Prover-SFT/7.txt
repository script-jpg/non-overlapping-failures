  To determine which of the given expressions is equivalent to \( (2+3)(2^2+3^2)(2^4+3^4)(2^8+3^8)(2^{16}+3^{16})(2^{32}+3^{32})(2^{64}+3^{64}) \), we will expand the product and simplify it step by step.
  1. Start by expanding the product of the terms.
  2. Use the properties of exponents and the distributive property to combine like terms.
  3. Recognize that the product of these terms can be simplified to a form that matches one of the given options.
  -/
  -- Simplify the product of the terms using properties of exponents and the distributive property.
  simp only [Finset.prod_range_succ, Finset.prod_range_one, pow_one, pow_two, pow_mul,
    pow_add, mul_add, mul_one, mul_assoc, mul_comm, mul_left_comm]
  -- Normalize the numerical expressions to verify the equivalence.
  norm_num
  -- Confirm that the simplified expression matches the target form.
