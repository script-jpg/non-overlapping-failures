  To show that the product \((2+3)(2^2+3^2)(2^4+3^4)(2^8+3^8)(2^{16}+3^{16})(2^{32}+3^{32})(2^{64}+3^{64})\) is equivalent to \(3^{128} - 2^{128}\), we can use algebraic properties and simplification techniques. Specifically, we will use the fact that the product of sums of powers of 2 and 3 can be simplified by considering the differences of powers.
