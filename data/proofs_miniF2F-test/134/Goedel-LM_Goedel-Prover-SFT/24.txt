  To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the product \((2+3)(2^2+3^2)(2^4+3^4)(2^8+3^8)(2^{16}+3^{16})(2^{32}+3^{32})(2^{64}+3^{64})\) and show that it equals \(3^{128} - 2^{128}\).
  1. Start by simplifying each term in the product.
  2. Use the properties of exponents to combine the terms.
  3. Recognize that the product of these terms can be expressed in a form that simplifies to \(3^{128} - 2^{128}\).
