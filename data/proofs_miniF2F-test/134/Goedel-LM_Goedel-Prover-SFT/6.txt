  To solve the given problem, we need to evaluate the product of the sequence of terms \(2^{2^k} + 3^{2^k}\) for \(k\) ranging from 0 to 6. We will show that this product equals \(3^{128} - 2^{128}\).
  1. Start by expressing the product in a more manageable form.
  2. Use the properties of exponents to simplify the terms.
  3. Combine the terms using the distributive property.
  4. Recognize that the product of these terms results in a difference of powers of 3 and 2.
  5. Verify that the final result matches \(3^{128} - 2^{128}\).
