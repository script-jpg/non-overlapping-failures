  To solve the problem, we need to determine the equivalent expression for the product \((2+3)(2^2+3^2)(2^4+3^4)(2^8+3^8)(2^{16}+3^{16})(2^{32}+3^{32})(2^{64}+3^{64})\).
  1. Start by simplifying the product using properties of exponents and the distributive property.
  2. Recognize that each term in the product can be written as a difference of powers of 3 and 2.
  3. Use the fact that the product of sums of powers of 3 and 2 will simplify to a difference of powers of 3 and 2.
  4. Finally, verify that the simplified expression matches the given option \(\textbf{(C)} ~3^{128}-2^{128}\).
