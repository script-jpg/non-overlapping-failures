  To show that the product of the sequence \((2+3)(2^2+3^2)(2^4+3^4)(2^8+3^8)(2^{16}+3^{16})(2^{32}+3^{32})(2^{64}+3^{64})\) equals \(3^{128} - 2^{128}\), we can use algebraic properties and simplification techniques. Specifically, we will use the fact that the product of sums of powers of 2 and 3 can be manipulated to show the equality.

  -- Use norm_num to simplify the expression involving powers and products.
  norm_num [Finset.prod_range_succ, pow_succ, mul_add, mul_comm, mul_left_comm]
  -- Use ring to further simplify the expression and show the equality.
