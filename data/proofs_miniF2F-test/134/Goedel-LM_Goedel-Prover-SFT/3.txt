  To solve the problem, we need to compute the product of the sequence \((2+3)(2^2+3^2)(2^4+3^4)(2^8+3^8)(2^{16}+3^{16})(2^{32}+3^{32})(2^{64}+3^{64})\) and determine which of the given options is equivalent to this product.
  1. Start by expressing each term in the product as a power of 2 plus a power of 3.
  2. Use the properties of exponents to expand the product.
  3. Simplify the resulting expression by combining like terms.
  4. Recognize that the simplified expression matches the form \(3^{128} - 2^{128}\).
