  To show that the product \((2+3)(2^2+3^2)(2^4+3^4)(2^8+3^8)(2^{16}+3^{16})(2^{32}+3^{32})(2^{64}+3^{64})\) is equal to \(3^{128} - 2^{128}\), we start by expressing the product as a difference of powers of 3 and 2. We use the fact that each term in the product can be written as \(2^{2^k} + 3^{2^k}\). By expanding the product, we observe that it simplifies to the difference of powers of 3 and 2.
