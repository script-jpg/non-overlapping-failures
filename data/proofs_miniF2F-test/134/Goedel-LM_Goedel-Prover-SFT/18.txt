  To show that the product \((2+3)(2^2+3^2)(2^4+3^4)(2^8+3^8)(2^{16}+3^{16})(2^{32}+3^{32})(2^{64}+3^{64})\) equals \(3^{128} - 2^{128}\), we can use the difference of powers identity. Specifically, we will use the identity for the product of sums of powers of 2 and 3.

  -- Use the difference of powers identity to simplify the product.
  -- Specifically, we will show that the product of the sums of powers of 2 and 3
  -- can be expressed as the difference of powers of 3 and 2.
