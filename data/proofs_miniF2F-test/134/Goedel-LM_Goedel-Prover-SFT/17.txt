  To show that the product of the series \((2+3)(2^2+3^2)(2^4+3^4)(2^8+3^8)(2^{16}+3^{16})(2^{32}+3^{32})(2^{64}+3^{64})\) equals \(3^{128} - 2^{128}\), we can use the properties of exponents and the distributive property of multiplication over addition. Specifically, we will expand the product and simplify it step by step, leveraging the fact that \(2^2 = 4\) and \(3^2 = 9\).
