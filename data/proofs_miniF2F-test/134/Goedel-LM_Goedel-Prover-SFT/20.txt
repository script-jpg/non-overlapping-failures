  To prove that the product \((2+3)(2^2+3^2)(2^4+3^4)(2^8+3^8)(2^{16}+3^{16})(2^{32}+3^{32})(2^{64}+3^{64})\) equals \(3^{128} - 2^{128}\), we can use the distributive property of multiplication over addition. Each term in the product can be expanded and simplified using the binomial theorem. By summing the results of these expansions, we can show that the product equals the given expression.
