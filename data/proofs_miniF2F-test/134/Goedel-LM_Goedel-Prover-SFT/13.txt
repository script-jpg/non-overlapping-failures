  To prove that the product \((2+3)(2^2+3^2)(2^4+3^4)(2^8+3^8)(2^{16}+3^{16})(2^{32}+3^{32})(2^{64}+3^{64})\) is equivalent to \(3^{128} - 2^{128}\), we can use the properties of geometric series and the binomial theorem. Specifically, we can express each term in the product as a sum of powers of 2 and 3, and then use the fact that the product of these terms can be simplified using known identities.
