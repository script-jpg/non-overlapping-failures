  We need to show that the product of the sequence \((2 + 3)(2^2 + 3^2)(2^4 + 3^4)(2^8 + 3^8)(2^{16} + 3^{16})(2^{32} + 3^{32})(2^{64} + 3^{64})\) equals \(3^{128} - 2^{128}\).
  1. Start by expanding the product using the distributive property.
  2. Simplify the resulting expression by combining like terms.
  3. Recognize that the terms involving powers of 2 and 3 can be grouped in a way that simplifies to \(3^{128} - 2^{128}\).
