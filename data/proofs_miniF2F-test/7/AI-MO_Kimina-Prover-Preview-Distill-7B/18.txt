-- We need to show that $f(f(10)) = 1$.

  -- First of all, we should understand the problem in terms of the definitions:
  -- We have a bijective function $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ and its inverse $f^{-1} : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$.
  -- This means that $f$ is a bijection (Equiv in Lean), and we have:
  -- $f(f^{-1}(x)) = x$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$ (left inverse property)
  -- $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$ (right inverse property)

  -- The problem gives us a function $h(x) = f^{-1}(x)$ with three specific values:
  -- $h(2) = 10$ (so $f^{-1}(2) = 10$)
  -- $h(10) = 1$ (so $f^{-1}(10) = 10$)
  -- $h(1) = 2$ (so $f^{-1}(1) = 2$)

  -- From the left inverse property, we have:
  -- $f(f^{-1}(2)) = 2$, which means $f(10) = 2$
  -- $f(f^{-1}(10)) = 10$, which means $f(1) = 10$
  -- $f(f^{-1}(1)) = 1$, which means $f(2) = 1$

  -- Now we need to compute $f(f(10))$:
  -- From $f(10) = 2$ (from $h(2) = 10$), we get $f(f(10)) = f(2) = 1$ (from $h(1) = 2$)

  -- Let's formalize this in Lean:

  have h₃ : σ.1 10 = 2 := by
    rw [←σ.right_inv 2]
    rw [h₀]
  have h₄ : σ.1 2 = 1 := by
    rw [←σ.right_inv 10]
    rw [h₁]
  have h₅ : σ.1 1 = 10 := by
    rw [←σ.right_inv 1]
    rw [h₂]

  -- Now we can compute $f(f(10))$:
  -- $f(10) = 2$ (from $h(2) = 10$)
  -- $f(f(10)) = f(2) = 1$ (from $h(1) = 2$)

  rw [h₃, h₄]
