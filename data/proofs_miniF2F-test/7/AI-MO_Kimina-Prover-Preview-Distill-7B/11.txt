-- We know that σ.1 is the inverse of σ.2 and vice versa.
  -- Thus, we have:

  have h₃ : σ.1 10 = 2 := by
    -- Since σ.2 1 = 2, it follows that σ.1 2 = 1
    rw [←σ.right_inv 1]
    rw [h₂]
    -- Since σ.2 1 = 2, it follows that σ.1 2 = 1
    rw [σ.left_inv 2]
  -- Since σ.2 2 = 10, it follows that σ.1 10 = 2
  rw [←σ.right_inv 2]
  rw [h₀]
  -- Since σ.2 2 = 10, it follows that σ.1 10 = 2
  rw [σ.left_inv 10]
  -- Thus, f(f(10)) = 1
