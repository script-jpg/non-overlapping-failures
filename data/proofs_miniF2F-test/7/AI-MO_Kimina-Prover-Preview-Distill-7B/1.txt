-- We are working with a function σ which is a bijection from ℝ to ℝ.
  -- σ.1 is the function f such that f(a) = b iff σ.2 b = a.
  -- Thus, h(x) = f^{-1}(x) is σ.2 x = f.1 (f.1 x).

  -- We want to find f (f (10)). We know that σ.2 2 = 10, which means f.1 (f.1 10) = 2.
  -- We also know σ.2 1 = 2, which means f.1 (f.1 1) = 1.
  -- And σ.2 10 = 1 means f.1 (f.1 10) = 1.

  -- Therefore, f (f (10)) = 1.
