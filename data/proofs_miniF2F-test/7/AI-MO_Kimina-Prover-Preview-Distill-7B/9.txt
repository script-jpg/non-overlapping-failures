-- We have σ.1 : ℝ → ℝ, σ.2 : ℝ → ℝ, σ.1 is injective, σ.2 is injective, and they are inverses.

  -- From the problem statement, we have h(2) = 10, h(10) = 1, h(1) = 2.
  -- Since h = f⁻¹, we have f⁻¹(2) = 10, f⁻¹(10) = 1, f⁻¹(1) = 2.
  -- This means σ.2 2 = 10, σ.2 10 = 1, σ.2 1 = 2. We are already given these.
  -- We want to find f(f(10)).
  -- Since σ.2 2 = 10, we have σ.1 10 = 2.
  -- Since σ.2 10 = 1, we have σ.1 1 = 10.
  -- Therefore σ.1 (σ.1 10) = σ.1 2. We need to find σ.1 2.
  -- Since σ.2 1 = 2, we have σ.1 2 = 1.
  -- Therefore σ.1 (σ.1 10) = 1, which is the answer.

  calc _ = σ.1 2 := by rw [←σ.right_inv 1]; norm_num; rw [h₂]
       _ = 1     := by rw [←σ.right_inv 2]; norm_num; rw [h₀]
