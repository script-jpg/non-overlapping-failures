  Given the function \( h(x) = f^{-1}(x) \) and the conditions \( h(2) = 10 \), \( h(10) = 1 \), and \( h(1) = 2 \), we need to determine \( f(f(10)) \).
  First, we use the given conditions to establish the values of \( f \) at specific points. Since \( h(10) = 1 \), we have \( f(1) = 10 \). Similarly, since \( h(1) = 2 \), we have \( f(2) = 1 \).
  Next, we apply \( f \) to the result of \( f(10) \). Since \( f(10) = 1 \), we need to find \( f(1) \). From the previous step, we know \( f(1) = 10 \).
  Thus, \( f(f(10)) = f(1) = 10 \). However, this contradicts the given conditions. Therefore, we must have made an error in our reasoning. Let's re-evaluate the conditions and the steps carefully.
