  Given the function \( h(x) = f^{-1}(x) \) and the conditions \( h(2) = 10 \), \( h(10) = 1 \), and \( h(1) = 2 \), we need to determine \( f(f(10)) \).
  1. From \( h(10) = 1 \), we know \( f(1) = 10 \).
  2. From \( h(1) = 2 \), we know \( f(2) = 1 \).
  3. Since \( f \) is an inverse function, \( f(f(10)) = f(1) \) because \( f(1) = 10 \).
  4. Therefore, \( f(f(10)) = 1 \).
