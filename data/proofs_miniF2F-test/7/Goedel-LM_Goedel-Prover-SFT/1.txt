  Given the equivalence \( h(x) = f^{-1}(x) \), we know that \( h(2) = 10 \), \( h(10) = 1 \), and \( h(1) = 2 \). We need to determine \( f(f(10)) \).
  1. From \( h(10) = 1 \), we can deduce that \( f(1) = 10 \).
  2. From \( h(1) = 2 \), we can deduce that \( f(2) = 1 \).
  3. From \( h(2) = 10 \), we can deduce that \( f(10) = 2 \).
  Using these relationships, we can compute \( f(f(10)) \):
  - Since \( f(10) = 2 \), we have \( f(f(10)) = f(2) \).
  - From \( h(2) = 10 \), we know \( f(2) = 1 \).
  Thus, \( f(f(10)) = 1 \).
