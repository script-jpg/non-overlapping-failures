  Given the function \( h(x) = f^{-1}(x) \), we know the following values: \( h(2) = 10 \), \( h(10) = 1 \), and \( h(1) = 2 \). We need to determine \( f(f(10)) \).
  First, we use the fact that \( h(10) = 1 \) to rewrite \( f(10) \) as \( h^{-1}(1) \). Since \( h(1) = 2 \), we have \( h^{-1}(1) = 2 \).
  Next, we apply \( f \) to \( 2 \). Since \( h(2) = 10 \), we have \( h^{-1}(10) = 2 \).
  Thus, \( f(f(10)) = f(2) = 10 \).
