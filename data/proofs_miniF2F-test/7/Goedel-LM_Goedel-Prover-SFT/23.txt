  Given the function \( h(x) = f^{-1}(x) \) and the conditions \( h(2) = 10 \), \( h(10) = 1 \), and \( h(1) = 2 \), we need to determine \( f(f(10)) \).
  1. From \( h(10) = 1 \), we know \( f(1) = 10 \).
  2. From \( h(1) = 2 \), we know \( f(2) = 1 \).
  3. Applying \( f \) to both sides of \( f(1) = 10 \), we get \( f(f(1)) = f(10) \).
  4. Since \( f(10) = 1 \), we have \( f(f(1)) = 1 \).
  5. Therefore, \( f(f(10)) = 1 \).
