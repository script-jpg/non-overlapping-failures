  Given the function \( h(x) = f^{-1}(x) \), we are provided with the following conditions: \( h(2) = 10 \), \( h(10) = 1 \), and \( h(1) = 2 \). We need to determine \( f(f(10)) \).
  First, we use the given conditions to establish the equivalence of \( h \) and \( f \). Since \( h(2) = 10 \), \( h(10) = 1 \), and \( h(1) = 2 \), we can infer that \( f(10) = 2 \) and \( f(2) = 10 \).
  Next, we apply the function \( f \) to \( f(10) \). Given \( f(10) = 2 \), we need to find \( f(2) \). From the given conditions, we know \( f(2) = 10 \).
  Thus, \( f(f(10)) = f(2) = 10 \).
