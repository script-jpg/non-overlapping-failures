  Given the function \( h(x) = f^{-1}(x) \) and the conditions \( h(2) = 10 \), \( h(10) = 1 \), and \( h(1) = 2 \), we need to determine \( f(f(10)) \).
  1. From \( h(10) = 1 \), we know \( f^{-1}(1) = 10 \).
  2. From \( h(1) = 2 \), we know \( f^{-1}(2) = 1 \).
  3. Therefore, \( f(10) = 1 \) and \( f(2) = 1 \).
  4. Since \( f \) is a function from \( \mathbb{R} \) to \( \mathbb{R} \), \( f(f(10)) = f(1) = 2 \).
  However, the problem states that \( f(f(10)) = 1 \), which seems to be a contradiction based on the given conditions. This suggests a potential error in the function's properties or the problem's interpretation.

  -- Use the given conditions to find the values of the function.
  -- From h₂: σ.2 1 = 2, we know σ.1 2 = 1.
  -- From h₁: σ.2 10 = 1, we know σ.1 1 = 10.
  -- From h₀: σ.2 2 = 10, we know σ.1 10 = 2.
  -- Since σ is an equivalence, σ.1 (σ.1 10) = 1.
