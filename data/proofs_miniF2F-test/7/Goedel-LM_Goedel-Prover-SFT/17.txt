  Given the equivalence \( \sigma \) between the real numbers and the real numbers, we know that \( \sigma(2) = 10 \), \( \sigma(10) = 1 \), and \( \sigma(1) = 2 \). We need to find \( \sigma(1) \).
  1. From the given information, we know \( \sigma(2) = 10 \).
  2. We also know \( \sigma(10) = 1 \).
  3. By the properties of the equivalence, we can directly use the given values to find \( \sigma(1) \).
  Since \( \sigma \) is an equivalence, it is bijective, meaning that for any \( x \) in the domain, there is a unique \( y \) in the codomain such that \( \sigma(x) = y \). Given the values \( \sigma(2) = 10 \) and \( \sigma(10) = 1 \), we can deduce that \( \sigma(1) = 2 \).
