  Given the function \( h(x) = f^{-1}(x) \) and the conditions \( h(2) = 10 \), \( h(10) = 1 \), and \( h(1) = 2 \), we need to determine \( f(f(10)) \).
  1. From \( h(2) = 10 \), we know \( f^{-1}(2) = 10 \).
  2. From \( h(10) = 1 \), we know \( f^{-1}(10) = 1 \).
  3. From \( h(1) = 2 \), we know \( f^{-1}(1) = 2 \).
  Using these conditions, we can deduce:
  - Since \( f^{-1}(10) = 1 \), it follows that \( f(1) = 10 \).
  - Since \( f^{-1}(2) = 10 \), it follows that \( f(10) = 2 \).
  Thus, \( f(f(10)) = f(2) \).
  Given the conditions, we can conclude that \( f(2) = 10 \).
  Therefore, \( f(f(10)) = 10 \).
