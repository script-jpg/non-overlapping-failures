  Given the function \( h(x) = f^{-1}(x) \), we are provided with the following conditions: \( h(2) = 10 \), \( h(10) = 1 \), and \( h(1) = 2 \). We need to determine \( f(f(10)) \).
  1. From \( h(10) = 1 \), we have \( f(1) = 10 \).
  2. From \( h(1) = 2 \), we have \( f(2) = 1 \).
  3. Since \( f(1) = 10 \) and \( f(2) = 1 \), we can infer that \( f(f(10)) = f(1) = 10 \).
  However, the goal is to show that \( f(f(10)) = 1 \). This suggests a misunderstanding in the problem setup or interpretation.
