  Given the function \( h(x) = f^{-1}(x) \) and the conditions \( h(2) = 10 \), \( h(10) = 1 \), and \( h(1) = 2 \), we need to determine \( f(f(10)) \).
  1. From \( h(10) = 1 \), we have \( f(1) = 10 \).
  2. From \( h(1) = 2 \), we have \( f(2) = 1 \).
  3. From \( h(2) = 10 \), we have \( f(10) = 2 \).
  Using these conditions, we can compute \( f(f(10)) \):
  - First, compute \( f(10) \) using \( h(2) = 10 \), which gives \( f(10) = 2 \).
  - Next, compute \( f(2) \) using \( h(1) = 2 \), which gives \( f(2) = 1 \).
  Thus, \( f(f(10)) = f(2) = 1 \).
