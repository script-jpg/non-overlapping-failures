The problem involves finding the difference between two numbers given certain constraints. Let's start by understanding the problem statement:

We have:
1. x + y = 17402
2. 10 divides x
3. x/10 = y (erasing the units digit of x gives y)

We need to find x - y.

First, let's think about how to approach this algebraically. If 10 divides x, then x = 10k for some integer k. The condition x/10 = y means that k = y. So x = 10y.

Substituting into the equation x + y = 17402, we get:
10y + y = 17402
11y = 17402
y = 17402 / 11

Let's compute y:
17402 ÷ 11 = 1582

So y = 1582, and x = 10y = 10 × 1582 = 15820

Now we can find x - y:
x - y = 15820 - 1582 = 14238

This matches answer choice (D). Let's verify:
- x = 15820 is divisible by 10
- Erasing the units digit of x gives 1582 = y
- x + y = 15820 + 1582 = 17402 ✓

Now, let's translate this into Lean 4 code:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

We've imported the necessary libraries and opened namespaces for working with natural numbers, real numbers, topology, and rational numbers. The `maxHeartbeats 0` option allows Lean to perform more computations if needed.

Now let's define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem amc12a_2021_p3 (x y : ℕ) (h₀ : x + y = 17402) (h₁ : 10 ∣ x) (h₂ : x / 10 = y) :
    ↑x - ↑y = (14238 : ℤ) := by
```

So far, we've declared the theorem with the given conditions. Now we need to prove that the difference between x and y is 14238 when interpreted as integers.

Let's think about how to solve this. From h₁, we know that x is divisible by 10, so x = 10k for some k. From h₂, we have x/10 = y, which means k = y. Therefore, x = 10y.

Substituting x = 10y into h₀ (x + y = 17402), we get:
10y + y = 17402
11y = 17402
y = 17402 / 11

Let's compute y:
17402 ÷ 11 = 1582

So y = 1582, and x = 10y = 15820

Now we can find x - y:
x - y = 15820 - 1582 = 14238

In Lean, we can solve this using the `omega` tactic, which handles arithmetic goals involving natural numbers:

```tactics
omega
```

The `omega` tactic is powerful for solving arithmetic goals. It can deduce from the given constraints that x = 15820, y = 1582, and therefore x - y = 14238 as integers.

To recap why this is true:
1. From h₁, x is divisible by 10
2. From h₂, x/10 = y, so if x = 10k, then y = k
3. Substituting into h₀: 10k + k = 17402
4. 11k = 17402
5. k = 1582
6. So y = 1582, x = 10 × 1582 = 15820
7. x - y = 15820 - 1582 = 14238

The Lean proof is elegant because the `omega` tactic can solve all these arithmetic constraints automatically. This demonstrates how Lean's automation can handle problems that would typically require manual algebraic manipulation.

The final answer is indeed 14238, which corresponds to answer choice (D).
