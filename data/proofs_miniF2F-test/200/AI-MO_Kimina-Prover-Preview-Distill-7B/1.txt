The problem involves finding the difference between two numbers given certain constraints. Let's analyze the problem and develop a formal proof in Lean 4.

We're given that:
1. The sum of two natural numbers is 17,402: `x + y = 17402`
2. One of the numbers is divisible by 10: `10 ∣ x`
3. Erasing the units digit of that number gives the other number: `x / 10 = y`

Our goal is to find the difference between these two numbers.

First, I need to understand what it means for a number to be divisible by 10. If `10 ∣ x`, then there exists some natural number `k` such that `x = 10k`. The condition that erasing the units digit of `x` gives `y` means `x / 10 = y`, which implies `y = k` when `x = 10k`.

Let me start implementing the theorem statement:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop
set_option maxHeartbeats 0

```

Now, I can declare the theorem:

```tactics
theorem amc12a_2021_p3 (x y : ℕ) (h₀ : x + y = 17402) (h₁ : 10 ∣ x) (h₂ : x / 10 = y) :
    ↑x - ↑y = (14238 : ℤ) := by
```

I've now declared the theorem with the appropriate parameters and assumptions. Let's think about the proof strategy.

Since `10 ∣ x`, there exists some `k` such that `x = 10k`. The condition `x / 10 = y` means that `y = k` when `x = 10k`. So we can substitute `x = 10y` into the equation `x + y = 17402` to get `10y + y = 17402`, or `11y = 17402`. This gives `y = 17402 / 11 = 1582`. Then `x = 10y = 10 * 1582 = 15820`.

Let's verify:
- `x = 15820` is divisible by 10
- `x / 10 = 15820 / 10 = 1582 = y`
- `x + y = 15820 + 1582 = 17402`

The difference between the two numbers is `x - y = 15820 - 1582 = 14238`.

In Lean 4, we can use the `omega` tactic, which is designed to solve integer arithmetic problems:

```tactics
omega
```

The `omega` tactic is powerful for solving problems involving linear integer arithmetic. It automatically handles the reasoning about natural numbers, divisibility, and the relationships between the variables.

The key insight in this problem is that when a number is divisible by 10, its units digit is 0, and "erasing the units digit" is equivalent to dividing by 10. This gives us the relationship `x = 10y`, which combined with `x + y = 17402` leads to the unique solution `x = 15820` and `y = 1582`, with difference `14238`.

The formal proof in Lean 4 elegantly captures the problem's constraints and allows the automated `omega` tactic to compute the answer.
