The `omega` tactic is perfect for this problem because it can handle linear integer arithmetic. Let me explain why:

1. We have three conditions:
   - x + y = 17402 (h₀)
   - 10 divides x (h₁)
   - x/10 = y (h₂)

2. From h₁ and h₂, we can deduce that x = 10y. This is because if 10 divides x, then x = 10k for some integer k. And h₂ tells us that k = y.

3. Substituting x = 10y into h₀ gives us 10y + y = 17402, which simplifies to 11y = 17402.

4. Solving for y: y = 17402 / 11 = 1582.

5. Then x = 10y = 10 * 1582 = 15820.

6. The difference between these two numbers is x - y = 15820 - 1582 = 14238.

The `omega` tactic can perform these arithmetic steps automatically. It will:
- Recognize that x = 10y from h₁ and h₂
- Substitute into h₀ to get 11y = 17402
- Solve for y
- Compute x = 10y
- Calculate x - y = 14238

Therefore, the answer is (D) 14,238.
