The problem involves finding the difference between two numbers given certain constraints. Let's analyze the conditions:

1. We have two natural numbers $x$ and $y$ such that $x + y = 17402$.
2. One of the numbers is divisible by 10. Let's assume $x$ is divisible by 10 (the choice is symmetric).
3. When the units digit of $x$ is erased, $y$ is obtained. This means $x / 10 = y$ (integer division).

We're tasked with finding the difference $x - y$.

Let's start by setting up our Lean 2 proof structure:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

This imports the necessary libraries, sets the heartbeats to unlimited (for complex arithmetic problems), and opens the relevant namespaces.

Now, let's formulate the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem amc12a_2021_p3 (x y : ℕ) (h₀ : x + y = 17402) (h₁ : 10 ∣ x) (h₂ : x / 10 = y) :
    ↑x - ↑y = (14238 : ℤ) := by
```

Here, we've declared our theorem with the given conditions:
- `h₀`: The sum of x and y equals 17402
- `h₁`: 10 divides x (so x is divisible by 10)
- `h₂`: x/10 = y (where / denotes integer division)

Now, let's solve this algebraically before formalizing in Lean. If x is divisible by 10, then x = 10k for some integer k. And y = x/10 = k. So:
x + y = 10k + k = 11k = 17402
So k = 17402 / 11 = 1582 (exact division since 11 divides 17402)

Therefore:
x = 10k = 10 * 1582 = 15820
y = k = 1582

And the difference x - y = 15820 - 1582 = 14238

In Lean, we can use the `omega` tactic to solve these arithmetic constraints automatically:

```tactics
omega
```

The `omega` tactic is powerful for solving linear arithmetic problems involving natural numbers and integers. It automatically handles the constraints given in our theorem and computes that the difference between x and y must be 14238.

To summarize the solution:
1. We have x + y = 17402
2. x is divisible by 10, so x = 10k, y = k
3. 11k = 17402, so k = 1582
4. Thus x = 15820, y = 1582, and x - y = 14238

The Lean proof is remarkably concise because the `omega` tactic can solve these kinds of arithmetic problems directly. In a more manual approach, we would need to introduce variables, express the constraints, and derive the result step by step. But for this problem, `omega` efficiently handles all the arithmetic reasoning.
