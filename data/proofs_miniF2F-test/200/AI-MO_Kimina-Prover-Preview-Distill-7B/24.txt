The Lean proof is elegant and concise. Let's break down what's happening in the proof:

1. We have three conditions:
   - `h₀`: x + y = 17402 (the sum of the two numbers is 17,402)
   - `h₁`: 10 ∣ x (one of the numbers is divisible by 10)
   - `h₂`: x / 10 = y (erasing the units digit of the divisible-by-10 number gives the other number)

2. The key insight is that if x is divisible by 10, then x = 10k for some integer k. And from `h₂`, we have k = y.

3. So we can rewrite our equations:
   - x = 10y (from `h₁` and `h₂`)
   - x + y = 17402 (from `h₀`)

4. Substituting x = 10y into x + y = 17402 gives:
   - 10y + y = 17402
   - 11y = 17402
   - y = 17402 / 11 = 1582

5. Then x = 10y = 10 * 1582 = 15820

6. The difference between these two numbers is:
   - x - y = 15820 - 1582 = 14238

7. The Lean proof is verifying that this difference is indeed 14,238, which corresponds to answer choice (D).

The Lean code uses the `omega` tactic, which is powerful for solving arithmetic goals involving natural numbers and integers. The `omega` tactic can handle linear arithmetic goals with integer constraints, which is exactly what we have here.

The `omega` tactic works by:
- Understanding the constraints from our hypotheses
- Using the fact that x is divisible by 10, so x = 10k for some integer k
- Using the fact that k = y from h₂
- Substituting into h₀ to get x + y = 17402
- Computing x = 10y
- Solving 10y + y = 17402
- Finding y = 1582
- Computing x = 10 * 1582 = 15820
- Calculating x - y = 15820 - 1582 = 14238

Therefore, the difference between the two numbers is 14,238, confirming that the answer is (D).
</- The sum of two natural numbers is $17{,}402$. One of the two numbers is divisible by $10$. If the units digit of that number is erased, the other number is obtained. What is the difference of these two numbers?
