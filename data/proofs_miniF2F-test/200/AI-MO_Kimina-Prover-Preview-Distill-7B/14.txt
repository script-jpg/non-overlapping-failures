The key insight is that we have two numbers, $x$ and $y$, where $x$ is divisible by $10$ (so $x = 10k$ for some $k$), and $y$ is obtained by erasing the units digit of $x$. This means $y = k$. We also know $x + y = 17402$.

Substituting $x = 10k$ and $y = k$ into the equation $x + y = 17402$, we get $10k + k = 17402$, which simplifies to $11k = 17402$. Solving for $k$ gives $k = 17402 ÷ 11 = 1582$. 

Therefore, $x = 10k = 10 × 1582 = 15820$ and $y = k = 1582$. The difference between these two numbers is $x - y = 15820 - 1582 = 14238$.

Let's translate this into Lean 4:

We start by importing the necessary libraries and setting up the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem amc12a_2021_p3 (x y : ℕ) (h₀ : x + y = 17402) (h₁ : 10 ∣ x) (h₂ : x / 10 = y) :
    ↑x - ↑y = (14238 : ℤ) := by 
```

We've declared the theorem with our variables and assumptions. We have:
- $h₀: x + y = 17402$ (the sum of the two numbers is 17,402)
- $h₁: 10 ∣ x$ (one of the numbers is divisible by 10)
- $h₂: x / 10 = y$ (if you erase the units digit of that number, you get the other number)

Let's think about how to solve this. If $10 ∣ x$, then $x = 10k$ for some natural number $k$. And from $h₂$, we have $y = k$. Substituting into $h₀$, we get $10k + k = 17402$, or $11k = 17402$. 

So $k = 17402 ÷ 11 = 1582$. This means $x = 10 × 1582 = 15820$ and $y = 1582$. The difference $x - y = 15820 - 1582 = 14238$.

In Lean, we can use the `omega` tactic, which is powerful for solving linear arithmetic goals:

```tactics
omega
```

The `omega` tactic is able to solve this problem directly by:
1. Understanding that $x$ is divisible by 10, so $x = 10k$
2. From $x/10 = y$, inferring $y = k$
3. Substituting into $x + y = 17402$ to get $10k + k = 17402$
4. Solving to get $k = 1582$
5. Therefore $x = 10 × 1582 = 15820$ and $y = 1582$
6. Computing the difference $x - y = 15820 - 1582 = 14238$
7. Converting to Lean's integer type to show the answer is 14238

The beauty of this problem is that while it seems like we might have two unknowns and only one equation, the additional constraints ( divisibility by 10 and the relationship between the digits) give us enough information to find a unique solution.
