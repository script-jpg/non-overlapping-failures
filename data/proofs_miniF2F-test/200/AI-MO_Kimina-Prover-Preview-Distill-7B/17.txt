The key insight is that $x$ is divisible by $10$, so $x = 10k$ for some natural number $k$. Then, we have:
- $x + y = 17402$
- $10k + y = 17402$
- $y = 17402 - 10k$

Also, we know that when the units digit of $x$ is erased, $y$ is obtained. So $x / 10 = y$ (integer division).

Let's formalize this in Lean 4:

Now, we'll define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem amc12a_2021_p3 (x y : ℕ) (h₀ : x + y = 17402) (h₁ : 10 ∣ x) (h₂ : x / 10 = y) :
    ↑x - ↑y = (14238 : ℤ) := by
```

I've started by setting up the theorem with the given conditions. We have:
- `h₀`: x + y = 17402
- `h₁`: 10 divides x
- `h₂`: x / 10 = y

Let's think about how to approach this algebraically. Since $10 \mid x$, we can write $x = 10k$ for some integer $k$. Then $x / 10 = k = y$. So $y = k$.

Substituting $x = 10k$ and $y = k$ into $x + y = 17402$, we get:
$10k + k = 17402$
$11k = 17402$
$k = 17402 / 11 = 1582$

So $x = 10k = 10 \cdot 1582 = 15820$ and $y = k = 1582$.

Let's compute $x - y$:
$x - y = 15820 - 1582 = 14238$

This matches answer choice (D). In Lean, we can complete the proof using the `omega` tactic, which is powerful for solving linear arithmetic problems:

```tactics
omega
```

The `omega` tactic can automatically solve this problem by:
1. Recognizing that $x = 10k$ for some $k$ from the divisibility condition
2. Using $x / 10 = y$ to deduce $y = k$
3. Substituting into $x + y = 17402$ to get $10k + k = 17402$
4. Solving for $k = 1582$
5. Computing $x - y = 10k - k = 9k = 9 \cdot 1582 = 14238$

So the answer is $14,238$, which is option (D).
