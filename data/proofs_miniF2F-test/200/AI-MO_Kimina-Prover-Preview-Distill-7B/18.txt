This proof uses the `omega` tactic, which is powerful for solving linear integer arithmetic problems. The constraints given in the problem are translated into a system of equations that `omega` can solve automatically. The key insight is that when one number is divisible by 10, its units digit is effectively erased by dividing by 10, and the other number is obtained.

The answer is (D) 14,238.

/-- The sum of two natural numbers is $17{,}402$. One of the two numbers is divisible by $10$. If the units digit of that number is erased, the other number is obtained. What is the difference of these two numbers?
