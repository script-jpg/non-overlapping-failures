# Solving the AMC 12A 2021 Problem 3 in Lean 4

Let me tackle this number theory problem about finding the difference between two numbers with specific properties. We're given that:

1. The sum of two natural numbers is 17,402.
2. One of the numbers is divisible by 10.
3. If the units digit of that divisible-by-10 number is erased, the other number is obtained.

We need to find the difference between these two numbers.

Let's denote the number divisible by 10 as $x$ and the other number as $y$.

First, let's think about the problem structure. If $x$ is divisible by 10, then $x = 10k$ for some natural number $k$. The condition that erasing the units digit of $x$ gives $y$ means $y = k$ (since dividing by 10 and taking the integer part is what "erasing the units digit" would mean for a number divisible by 10).

So we have:
- $x + y = 17402$
- $x = 10k$
- $y = k$

Substituting $x = 10k$ and $y = k$ into the sum equation:
$10k + k = 17402$
$11k = 17402$
$k = 17402 / 11 = 1582$

So $x = 10 \cdot 1582 = 15820$ and $y = 1582$.

The difference $x - y = 15820 - 1582 = 14238$.

Let's verify that 14238 is one of the answer choices - indeed it is option (D).

Now, let's translate this into a formal Lean 4 proof:

We've imported the necessary libraries and opened namespaces for our work. Let's define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem amc12a_2021_p3 (x y : ℕ) (h₀ : x + y = 17402) (h₁ : 10 ∣ x) (h₂ : x / 10 = y) :
    ↑x - ↑y = (14238 : ℤ) := by
```

We have the theorem statement with:
- x + y = 17402 (h₀)
- 10 divides x (h₁)
- x / 10 = y (h₂)

From h₁, since 10 divides x, we can write x = 10 * k for some natural number k. 
From h₂, x / 10 = y, which means y = k when x = 10 * k.

Substituting into h₀: 10 * k + k = 17402
So 11 * k = 17402
k = 17402 / 11 = 1582
Then x = 10 * 1582 = 15820
y = 1582
Difference x - y = 15820 - 1582 = 14238

Let's complete the Lean proof:

```tactics
omega
```

The Lean proof is remarkably concise. The `omega` tactic is powerful for solving arithmetic goals involving natural numbers and integers. It can deduce that:

1. From h₁, there exists k such that x = 10 * k
2. From h₂, x / 10 = y, which with x = 10 * k gives y = k
3. Substituting into h₀: 10 * k + k = 17402
4. So 11 * k = 17402
5. k = 1582
6. x = 10 * 1582 = 15820
7. y = 1582
8. x - y = 15820 - 1582 = 14238

The omega tactic handles all these arithmetic manipulations automatically, proving that the difference is indeed 14238.

The beauty of this problem is how a simple algebraic manipulation leads to the answer, and Lean's automation can verify it directly from the given constraints.
