The key insight is that the two numbers must be of the form $10a$ and $b$, where $10a + b = 17402$ and $a + b = 1740$. This gives us a system of linear equations:
- $10a + b = 17402$
- $a + b = 1740$

To solve for $a$ and $b$, we can subtract the second equation from the first:
- $10a + b - (a + b) = 17402 - 1740$
- $9a = 15662$
- $a = 1740.222...$

However, we realize that $a$ must be an integer since it's a digit in the original number. This suggests that our initial assumption about which number is divisible by 10 is incorrect. Let's re-evaluate.

If $x$ is not divisible by 10, then $y$ must be divisible by 10. So $y = 10b$ for some integer $b$. This gives us:
- $x + 10b = 17402$
- $x + b = 1740$

Subtracting the second from the first:
- $x + 10b - (x + b) = 17402 - 1740$
- $9b = 15662$
- $b = 1740.222...$

Again, $b$ is not an integer, which means our assumption is still incorrect. Let's analyze why this is happening.

For $x$ to be divisible by 10, it must end in 0. If we remove the units digit of $x$, we get $x/10 = y$. This means $x = 10y + d$, where $d$ is the units digit of $x$ (which must be 0). But if $x = 10y$, then $x$ is divisible by 10, and removing the units digit gives $y = x/10$.

So we have:
- $x + y = 17402$
- $x = 10y$

Substituting the second into the first:
- $10y + y = 17402$
- $11y = 17402$
- $y = 1582$

Then $x = 10y = 10 \times 1582 = 15820$.

The difference is $x - y = 15820 - 1582 = 14238$.

Let's verify:
- $x + y = 15820 + 1582 = 17402$ ✓
- $15820$ is divisible by $10$ ✓
- Removing the units digit of $15820$ gives $1582$ ✓

So the answer is indeed $14238$.

Now we'll define our theorem with the given constraints:

```tactics
theorem amc12a_2021_p3 (x y : ℕ) (h₀ : x + y = 17402) (h₁ : 10 ∣ x) (h₂ : x / 10 = y) :
    ↑x - ↑y = (14238 : ℤ) := by
```

So far, we've imported the necessary libraries, set up the basic framework, and defined our theorem with the given conditions. Now we need to solve the problem by determining the values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy all the constraints.

Let's think about how to approach this. We have:
- $x + y = 17402$
- $10 \mid x$ (i.e., $x$ is divisible by 10)
- $x/10 = y$ (i.e., removing the units digit of $x$ gives $y$)

From the third constraint, we know $x = 10y$. Substituting into the first constraint gives:
- $10y + y = 17402$
- $11y = 17402$
- $y = 1582$

Then $x = 10y = 10 \times 1582 = 15820$.

The difference is $x - y = 15820 - 1582 = 14238$.

In Lean, we can solve this directly using the `omega` tactic, which handles linear arithmetic:

```tactics
omega
```

The `omega` tactic is powerful enough to solve this system of constraints directly. It will:
1. Recognize that $x = 10y$ from the divisibility constraint
2. Substitute into $x + y = 17402$ to get $11y = 17402$
3. Solve to get $y = 1582$ and $x = 15820$
4. Compute $x - y = 15820 - 1582 = 14238$
5. Verify that this equals the expected answer

So the complete solution is:
- $x = 15820$ (divisible by 10, and $15820/10 = 1582$)
- $y = 1582$ (and $15820 + 1582 = 17402$)
- $x - y = 15820 - 1582 = 14238$

The Lean proof is remarkably concise because the `omega` tactic can handle all the arithmetic reasoning automatically.
