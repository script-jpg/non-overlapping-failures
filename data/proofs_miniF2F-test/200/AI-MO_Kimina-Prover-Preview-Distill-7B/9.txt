This Lean 4 proof is solving the AMC 12A 2021 Problem 3, where we have two natural numbers x and y such that:
- Their sum is 17,402 (h₀: x + y = 17402)
- One of them (x) is divisible by 10 (h₁: 10 ∣ x)
- Erasing the units digit of x gives y (h₂: x / 10 = y)

We need to find the difference x - y.

First, let's think about what it means for x to be divisible by 10. If x is divisible by 10, then x = 10k for some natural number k. The condition h₂ says that erasing the units digit of x gives y, which means x / 10 = y. So if x = 10k, then y = k.

Substituting into the equation h₀: x + y = 17402, we get:
10k + k = 17402
11k = 17402
k = 17402 / 11

Let's compute 17402 ÷ 11:
17402 ÷ 11 = 1582 (since 11 × 1582 = 17402)

So k = 1582, which means:
x = 10k = 10 × 1582 = 15820
y = k = 1582

The difference x - y = 15820 - 1582 = 14238

This matches answer choice (D). Now, let's translate this into Lean 4 code:

We start by importing the necessary libraries and setting up the problem. We have two natural numbers x and y satisfying the given conditions. Our goal is to prove that x - y = 14238.

```tactics
theorem amc12a_2021_p3 (x y : ℕ) (h₀ : x + y = 17402) (h₁ : 10 ∣ x) (h₂ : x / 10 = y) :
    ↑x - ↑y = (14238 : ℤ) := by
```

Now we need to prove this. Let's think about how to solve this algebraically first. Since x is divisible by 10, we can write x = 10k for some k. Then from h₂, we have y = k. Substituting into h₀ gives 10k + k = 17402, so 11k = 17402, which means k = 1582. Therefore, x = 10 × 1582 = 15820 and y = 1582. The difference x - y = 15820 - 1582 = 14238.

In Lean, we can use the omega solver to solve arithmetic goals involving natural numbers:

```tactics

```

The omega tactic is powerful for solving goals involving linear arithmetic over integers or natural numbers. It can handle the constraints we have here:

1. x + y = 17402
2. 10 divides x
3. x / 10 = y

From these constraints, omega can derive that x = 15820, y = 1582, and therefore x - y = 14238.

The key insight is that if x is divisible by 10, then x = 10k, and y = k. Substituting into the sum equation gives 11k = 17402, which uniquely determines k = 1582. Therefore, x = 10 × 1582 = 15820 and y = 1582, so x - y = 14238.

Thus, the difference is 14238, which is answer (D).
</-- The sum of two natural numbers is $17{,}402$. One of the two numbers is divisible by $10$. If the units digit of that number is erased, the other number is obtained. What is the difference of these two numbers?
