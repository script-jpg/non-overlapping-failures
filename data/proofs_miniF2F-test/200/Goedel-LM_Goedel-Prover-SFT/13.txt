  Given that the sum of two natural numbers \( x \) and \( y \) is 17402, and one of the numbers is divisible by 10, we can express \( x \) as \( 10k \) for some integer \( k \). If the units digit of \( x \) is erased, the other number \( y \) is obtained. This implies \( y = 10k \). The difference between \( x \) and \( y \) is then \( 10k - 10k = 0 \). However, the problem states that the difference should be 14238. This discrepancy suggests a mistake in the problem statement or interpretation.
