  Given two natural numbers \( x \) and \( y \), we know that their sum is \( 17,402 \). Additionally, \( x \) is divisible by 10, and if the units digit of \( x \) is erased, the result is \( y \). We need to find the difference between \( x \) and \( y \).
  First, we use the given conditions:
  1. \( x + y = 17,402 \)
  2. \( x \) is divisible by 10, implying \( x \equiv 0 \pmod{10} \)
  3. \( x / 10 = y \)
  From the third condition, we can express \( x \) as \( 10k \) for some integer \( k \). Substituting \( x = 10k \) into the first condition, we get:
  \[ 10k + y = 17,402 \]
  Since \( x / 10 = y \), we have \( y = k \). Therefore, the equation simplifies to:
  \[ 10k + k = 17,402 \]
  \[ 11k = 17,402 \]
  Solving for \( k \):
  \[ k = \frac{17,402}{11} = 1,582 \]
  Now, substituting \( k = 1,582 \) back into \( y = k \):
  \[ y = 1,582 \]
  Finally, calculating the difference \( x - y \):
  \[ x - y = 10k - y = 10 \times 1,582 - 1,582 = 14,238 \]
  Thus, the difference between \( x \) and \( y \) is \( 14,238 \).
