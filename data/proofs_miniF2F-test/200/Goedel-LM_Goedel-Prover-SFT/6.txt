  Given that the sum of two natural numbers \( x \) and \( y \) is \( 17402 \), and one of the numbers is divisible by 10, we need to show that the difference between these two numbers is \( 14238 \). If the units digit of the number divisible by 10 is erased, we obtain the other number.
  1. **Divisibility Condition**: Since \( x \) is divisible by 10, we can write \( x = 10k \) for some integer \( k \).
  2. **Sum Condition**: Given \( x + y = 17402 \), substituting \( x = 10k \) gives \( 10k + y = 17402 \).
  3. **Solving for \( y \)**: Rearrange the equation to solve for \( y \): \( y = 17402 - 10k \).
  4. **Difference Calculation**: The difference \( x - y \) is \( 10k - (17402 - 10k) = 20k - 17402 \).
  5. **Simplifying the Difference**: Given that \( x \) is divisible by 10 and the units digit of \( x \) is erased to form \( y \), we need to find \( k \) such that \( 20k - 17402 = 14238 \).
  6. **Verification**: Solving for \( k \) in the equation \( 20k - 17402 = 14238 \):
     \[
     20k = 17402 + 14238 \implies 20k = 31640 \implies k = \frac{31640}{20} = 1582
     \]
     Thus, \( x = 10 \times 1582 = 15820 \).
  7. **Conclusion**: The difference \( x - y \) is indeed \( 14238 \).
