  Given two natural numbers \( x \) and \( y \), we know that \( x + y = 17402 \). Additionally, \( x \) is divisible by 10, and if the units digit of \( x \) is erased, the result is \( y \). We need to find the difference \( x - y \).
  1. Since \( x \) is divisible by 10, we can write \( x = 10k \) for some integer \( k \).
  2. Given \( x / 10 = y \), we substitute \( x = 10k \) to get \( 10k / 10 = y \), which simplifies to \( k = y \).
  3. Using \( x + y = 17402 \), we substitute \( x = 10k \) and \( y = k \) to get \( 10k + k = 17402 \), which simplifies to \( 11k = 17402 \).
  4. Solving for \( k \), we find \( k = \frac{17402}{11} = 1582 \).
  5. Therefore, \( x = 10k = 10 \times 1582 = 15820 \).
  6. The difference \( x - y \) is \( 15820 - 1582 = 14238 \).
