  Given two natural numbers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( x + y = 17402 \), \( x \) is divisible by 10, and if the units digit of \( x \) is erased, the other number \( y \) is obtained. We need to find the difference \( x - y \).
  1. Since \( x \) is divisible by 10, we can write \( x = 10k \) for some integer \( k \).
  2. Given \( x + y = 17402 \), substituting \( x = 10k \) into the equation, we get \( 10k + y = 17402 \).
  3. If the units digit of \( x \) is erased, the other number \( y \) is obtained, so \( x = 10y \).
  4. Substituting \( x = 10y \) into the equation \( 10k + y = 17402 \), we get \( 10y + y = 17402 \), which simplifies to \( 11y = 17402 \).
  5. Solving for \( y \), we get \( y = \frac{17402}{11} = 1582 \).
  6. Substituting \( y = 1582 \) back into \( x = 10y \), we get \( x = 10 \times 1582 = 15820 \).
  7. The difference \( x - y \) is \( 15820 - 1582 = 14238 \).
