  Given two natural numbers \( x \) and \( y \), we know that their sum is \( 17402 \). Additionally, \( x \) is divisible by 10, and if the units digit of \( x \) is erased, the result is \( y \). We need to find the difference \( x - y \).
  1. From the given conditions, we have \( x + y = 17402 \).
  2. Since \( x \) is divisible by 10, we can write \( x = 10k \) for some integer \( k \).
  3. The condition \( x / 10 = y \) implies that \( y \) is the integer part of \( x / 10 \).
  4. Substituting \( x = 10k \) into the equation \( x + y = 17402 \), we get \( 10k + y = 17402 \).
  5. Solving for \( y \), we find \( y = 17402 - 10k \).
  6. Since \( y \) must be an integer, \( 17402 - 10k \) must be an integer.
  7. Given the constraints, we solve for \( k \) and find that \( k = 1740 \) and \( y = 1740 \).
  8. Therefore, \( x = 10 \times 1740 = 17400 \).
  9. The difference \( x - y \) is \( 17400 - 1740 = 15660 \).
