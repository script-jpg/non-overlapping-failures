  Given two natural numbers \( x \) and \( y \), we know that their sum is \( 17402 \). Additionally, \( x \) is divisible by 10, and if the units digit of \( x \) is erased, we obtain \( y \). We need to find the difference \( x - y \).
  1. From the given conditions, we have:
     \[
     x + y = 17402
     \]
     \[
     x = 10y
     \]
  2. Substitute \( x = 10y \) into the first equation:
     \[
     10y + y = 17402 \implies 11y = 17402 \implies y = \frac{17402}{11} = 1582
     \]
  3. Calculate \( x \) using \( y = 1582 \):
     \[
     x = 10 \times 1582 = 15820
     \]
  4. Compute the difference \( x - y \):
     \[
     x - y = 15820 - 1582 = 14238
     \]
  Thus, the difference \( x - y \) is \( 14238 \).
