  Given two natural numbers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( x + y = 17402 \), \( x \) is divisible by 10, and the units digit of \( x \) is erased to obtain \( y \), we need to show that the difference \( x - y \) is 14238.
  1. Since \( x \) is divisible by 10, we can write \( x = 10k \) for some integer \( k \).
  2. Given \( x / 10 = y \), we substitute \( x = 10k \) to get \( k = y \).
  3. Substituting \( k = y \) into \( x + y = 17402 \), we get \( 10k + k = 17402 \), which simplifies to \( 11k = 17402 \).
  4. Solving for \( k \), we find \( k = \frac{17402}{11} \).
  5. Calculating \( k \), we get \( k = 1582 \).
  6. Therefore, \( x = 10k = 10 \times 1582 = 15820 \).
  7. Since \( x = 15820 \), we have \( y = k = 1582 \).
  8. Finally, we compute \( x - y = 15820 - 1582 = 14238 \).
