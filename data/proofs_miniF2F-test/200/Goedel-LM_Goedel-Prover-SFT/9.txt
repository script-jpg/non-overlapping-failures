  Given two natural numbers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( x + y = 17402 \), \( x \) is divisible by 10, and if the units digit of \( x \) is erased, the other number is obtained, we need to find the difference \( x - y \).
  1. From the given conditions, we have \( x + y = 17402 \).
  2. Since \( x \) is divisible by 10, we can write \( x = 10k \) for some integer \( k \).
  3. Given that \( x / 10 = y \), we substitute \( x = 10k \) into the equation to get \( k = y \).
  4. Substituting \( y = k \) into the sum equation \( x + y = 17402 \), we get \( 10k + k = 17402 \), which simplifies to \( 11k = 17402 \).
  5. Solving for \( k \), we find \( k = \frac{17402}{11} = 1582 \).
  6. Therefore, \( x = 10k = 10 \times 1582 = 15820 \) and \( y = k = 1582 \).
  7. The difference \( x - y \) is \( 15820 - 1582 = 14238 \).
