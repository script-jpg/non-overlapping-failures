  Given two natural numbers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( x + y = 17402 \), \( x \) is divisible by 10, and if the units digit of \( x \) is erased, the other number \( y \) is obtained, we need to find the difference \( x - y \).
  1. From the given conditions, we know:
     - \( x + y = 17402 \)
     - \( x \) is divisible by 10.
     - \( x / 10 = y \).
  2. Since \( x \) is divisible by 10, we can write \( x = 10k \) for some integer \( k \).
  3. Substituting \( x = 10k \) into the equation \( x + y = 17402 \), we get:
     \[
     10k + y = 17402
     \]
  4. Given \( x / 10 = y \), we substitute \( x = 10k \) into \( x / 10 = y \), yielding:
     \[
     k = y
     \]
  5. Substituting \( k = y \) into the equation \( 10k + y = 17402 \), we get:
     \[
     10y + y = 17402 \implies 11y = 17402 \implies y = \frac{17402}{11} = 1582
     \]
  6. Since \( k = y \), we have \( k = 1582 \).
  7. Therefore, \( x = 10k = 10 \times 1582 = 15820 \).
  8. The difference \( x - y \) is:
     \[
     x - y = 15820 - 1582 = 14238
     \]
