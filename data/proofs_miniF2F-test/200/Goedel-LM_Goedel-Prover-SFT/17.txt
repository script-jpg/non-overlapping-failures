  Given two natural numbers \( x \) and \( y \), we know that \( x + y = 17402 \). Additionally, \( x \) is divisible by 10, and if we erase the units digit of \( x \), we get \( y \). We need to find the difference \( x - y \).
  Since \( x \) is divisible by 10, we can write \( x = 10k \) for some integer \( k \). Given that \( x / 10 = y \), we have \( y = k \).
  Using the equation \( x + y = 17402 \), we substitute \( x = 10k \) and \( y = k \) to get:
  \[ 10k + k = 17402 \]
  \[ 11k = 17402 \]
  \[ k = \frac{17402}{11} \]
  \[ k = 1582 \]
  Thus, \( x = 10 \times 1582 = 15820 \) and \( y = 1582 \).
  Finally, we calculate the difference:
  \[ x - y = 15820 - 1582 = 14238 \]
  Therefore, the difference is \( \boxed{D} \).
