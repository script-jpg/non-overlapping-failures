  Given two natural numbers \( x \) and \( y \), where \( x \) is divisible by 10, and if the units digit of \( x \) is erased, the other number \( y \) is obtained. Additionally, the sum of \( x \) and \( y \) is 17,402. We need to find the difference \( x - y \).
  Since \( x \) is divisible by 10, we can write \( x = 10k \) for some integer \( k \). Given that \( x / 10 = y \), we substitute \( x = 10k \) into the equation \( x + y = 17402 \) to get \( 10k + k = 17402 \), which simplifies to \( 11k = 17402 \). Solving for \( k \), we find \( k = \frac{17402}{11} = 1582 \).
  Thus, \( x = 10 \times 1582 \) and \( y = 1582 \). The difference \( x - y \) is \( 10 \times 1582 - 1582 = 15820 - 1582 = 14238 \).

  -- Solve for k, which gives k = 1582.
  -- Thus, x = 10 * 1582 and y = 1582.
  -- The difference x - y is 10 * 1582 - 1582 = 15820 - 1582 = 14238.
