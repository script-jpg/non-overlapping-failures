  Given two natural numbers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( x + y = 17402 \), \( x \) is divisible by 10, and if the units digit of \( x \) is erased, the other number \( y \) is obtained, we need to find the difference \( x - y \).
  1. From the given conditions, we know:
     - \( x + y = 17402 \)
     - \( x \) is divisible by 10
     - \( x / 10 = y \)
  2. Since \( x \) is divisible by 10, we can write \( x = 10k \) for some integer \( k \).
  3. Given \( x / 10 = y \), we substitute \( x = 10k \) into this equation to get:
     \[
     y = \frac{10k}{10} = k
     \]
  4. Substitute \( y = k \) into the sum equation \( x + y = 17402 \):
     \[
     10k + k = 17402 \implies 11k = 17402
     \]
  5. Solve for \( k \):
     \[
     k = \frac{17402}{11} = 1582
     \]
  6. Calculate \( x \) and \( y \):
     \[
     x = 10k = 10 \times 1582 = 15820
     \]
     \[
     y = k = 1582
     \]
  7. Compute the difference \( x - y \):
     \[
     x - y = 15820 - 1582 = 14238
     \]
  Thus, the difference \( x - y \) is \( 14238 \).
