  Given two natural numbers \( x \) and \( y \), we know that their sum is \( 17,402 \). Additionally, \( x \) is divisible by 10, and if the units digit of \( x \) is erased, the other number is obtained. We need to find the difference between these two numbers.
  First, we use the given conditions:
  1. \( x + y = 17402 \)
  2. \( x \) is divisible by 10.
  3. \( x / 10 = y \).
  From the third condition, we can express \( x \) as \( x = 10y \). Substituting this into the first condition, we get:
  \[ 10y + y = 17402 \]
  \[ 11y = 17402 \]
  \[ y = \frac{17402}{11} = 1582 \]
  Now, substituting \( y = 1582 \) back into \( x = 10y \), we find:
  \[ x = 10 \times 1582 = 15820 \]
  Finally, the difference between \( x \) and \( y \) is:
  \[ x - y = 15820 - 1582 = 14238 \]
  Thus, the difference is \( 14238 \).
