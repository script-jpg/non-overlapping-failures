  Given two natural numbers \( x \) and \( y \), we know that \( x + y = 17402 \). Additionally, \( x \) is divisible by 10, and if the units digit of \( x \) is erased, the other number \( y \) is obtained. We need to find the difference \( x - y \).
  First, we express \( x \) in the form \( 10k + r \) where \( r \) is the units digit of \( x \). Given that \( x \) is divisible by 10, \( r = 0 \). Therefore, \( x = 10k \).
  From the problem statement, we have:
  \[ 10k + y = 17402 \]
  Since \( y \) is the result of erasing the units digit of \( x \), we can write:
  \[ y = \frac{x}{10} \]
  Substituting \( x = 10k \) into the equation \( y = \frac{x}{10} \), we get:
  \[ y = k \]
  Now, substituting \( y = k \) into the equation \( 10k + y = 17402 \), we obtain:
  \[ 10k + k = 17402 \]
  \[ 11k = 17402 \]
  Solving for \( k \):
  \[ k = \frac{17402}{11} = 1582 \]
  Since \( x = 10k \), we find:
  \[ x = 10 \times 1582 = 15820 \]
  Finally, the difference \( x - y \) is:
  \[ x - y = 15820 - 1582 = 14238 \]
  Thus, the difference \( x - y \) is \( \boxed{D} \).
