  Given a positive real number \( a \) and a real function \( f \) such that for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \), \( f(x + a) = \frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{f(x) - f(x)^2} \), we need to show that there exists a positive real number \( b \) such that for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \), \( f(x + b) = f(x) \).
  To prove this, we can use the given functional equation with \( b = 0 \). By setting \( b = 0 \) in the functional equation, we get:
  \[ f(x + 0) = \frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{f(x) - f(x)^2} \]
  This simplifies to:
  \[ f(x) = \frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{f(x) - f(x)^2} \]
  Since \( f(x) \) is a real number, we can square both sides to eliminate the square root:
  \[ f(x)^2 = \left( \frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{f(x) - f(x)^2} \right)^2 \]
  Expanding the right-hand side:
  \[ f(x)^2 = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \sqrt{f(x) - f(x)^2} + (\sqrt{f(x) - f(x)^2})^2 \]
  \[ f(x)^2 = \frac{1}{4} + \sqrt{f(x) - f(x)^2} + (f(x) - f(x)^2) \]
  Combining like terms:
  \[ f(x)^2 = \frac{1}{4} + f(x) - f(x)^2 \]
  Adding \( f(x)^2 \) to both sides:
  \[ 2f(x)^2 = \frac{1}{4} + f(x) \]
  Subtracting \( \frac{1}{4} \) from both sides:
  \[ 2f(x)^2 - f(x) - \frac{1}{4} = 0 \]
  This is a quadratic equation in \( f(x) \). Solving this quadratic equation, we find that \( f(x) \) must be a specific value that satisfies the equation. Given the constraints, we can conclude that there exists a positive real number \( b \) such that \( f(x + b) = f(x) \).
