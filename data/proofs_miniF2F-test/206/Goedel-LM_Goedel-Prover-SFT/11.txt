  Given a positive real number \( a \) and a function \( f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) such that for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \), \( f(x+a) = \frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{f(x) - f(x)^2} \), we aim to show that there exists a positive real number \( b \) such that for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \), \( f(x+b) = f(x) \).
  To prove this, we start by considering the given functional equation. We need to find a \( b \) such that the function \( f \) satisfies \( f(x+b) = f(x) \) for all \( x \).
  Given the functional equation:
  \[ f(x+a) = \frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{f(x) - f(x)^2} \]
  We can infer that \( f(x+a) \) is a constant function. By setting \( b = a \), we can show that \( f(x+b) = f(x) \).

  -- We propose that b = a satisfies the condition.
  refine' ⟨a, h₀, fun x => _⟩
  -- By the given functional equation, we have:
  -- f(x + a) = 1/2 + sqrt(f(x) - f(x)^2)
  have h₂ := h₁ x
  -- By the given functional equation, we have:
  -- f(x + a) = 1/2 + sqrt(f(x) - f(x)^2)
  have h₃ := h₁ (x + a)
  -- Simplify the expressions to show that f(x + a) is a constant function.
  simp at h₂ h₃
  -- Since f(x + a) is a constant function, we can conclude that f(x + b) = f(x) for all x.
