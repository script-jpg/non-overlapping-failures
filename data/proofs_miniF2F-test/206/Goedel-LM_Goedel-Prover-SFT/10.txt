  Given a positive real number \( a \) and a function \( f \) such that for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \), \( f(x + a) = \frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{f(x) - f(x)^2} \), we need to show that there exists a positive real number \( b \) such that \( f(x + b) = f(x) \) for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \).
  To prove this, we start by considering the given functional equation. By setting \( x = 0 \), we get:
  \[ f(a) = \frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{f(0) - f(0)^2} \]
  This implies that \( f(a) \) is a fixed point of the function \( f \) when \( x = 0 \). Since \( a \) is positive, we can use the periodicity of the function \( f \) to find such a \( b \).
