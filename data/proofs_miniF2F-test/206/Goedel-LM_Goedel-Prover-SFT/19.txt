  Given a positive real number \( a \) and a function \( f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) such that for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \), \( f(x + a) = \frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{f(x) - f(x)^2} \), we need to show that there exists a positive real number \( b \) such that for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \), \( f(x + b) = f(x) \).
  To prove this, we start by considering the given functional equation. We can rewrite it as:
  \[ f(x + a) = \frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{f(x) - f(x)^2} \]
  We aim to find a positive real number \( b \) such that \( f(x + b) = f(x) \) for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \). We propose \( b = a \) and verify that it satisfies the required condition.
