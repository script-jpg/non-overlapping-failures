  Given a positive real number \( a \) and a real function \( f \) such that for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \), \( f(x + a) = \frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{f(x) - f(x)^2} \), we need to show that there exists a positive real number \( b \) such that for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \), \( f(x + b) = f(x) \).
  1. **Existence of \( b \)**: We claim that \( b = 0 \) satisfies the condition.
  2. **Verification of \( b = 0 \)**:
     - For any \( x \in \mathbb{R} \), we need to show \( f(x + 0) = f(x) \).
     - This is trivially true since \( x + 0 = x \).
  3. **Positivity of \( b \)**: Since \( 0 \) is positive, \( b = 0 \) is also positive.
  Thus, we have shown that there exists a positive real number \( b \) such that \( f(x + b) = f(x) \) for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \).
