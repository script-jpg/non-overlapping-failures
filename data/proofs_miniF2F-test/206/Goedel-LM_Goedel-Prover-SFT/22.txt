  Given a positive real number \( a \) and a real function \( f \) such that for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \), \( f(x + a) = \frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{f(x) - f(x)^2} \), we need to show that there exists a positive real number \( b \) such that for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \), \( f(x + b) = f(x) \).
  To prove this, we can use the given functional equation with \( a \) as the constant. By setting \( b = 0 \), we can show that \( f(x + 0) = f(x) \), which is trivially true.

  -- We propose b = 0 as a solution.
  use 0
  -- We need to show that b = 0 is positive and satisfies the functional equation.
  constructor
  -- Since 0 is positive, we have 0 > 0.
