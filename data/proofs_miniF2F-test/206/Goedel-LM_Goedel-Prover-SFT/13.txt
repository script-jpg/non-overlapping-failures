  Given a positive real number \( a \) and a function \( f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) such that for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \), \( f(x + a) = \frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{f(x) - f(x)^2} \), we need to show that there exists a positive real number \( b \) such that \( f(x + b) = f(x) \) for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \).
  To prove this, we can use the given functional equation with \( a \) and \( b \) to show that \( f(x + b) = f(x) \) for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \). Specifically, we can choose \( b = 0 \) and use the properties of the function to show that \( f(x + 0) = f(x) \).

  -- We propose that b = 0 is a solution.
  use a, h₀
  -- We need to show that for all x, f(x + a) = f(x).
  intro x
  -- Using the given functional equation, we have:
  -- f(x + a) = 1/2 + sqrt(f(x) - f(x)^2)
  -- We can rewrite this as:
  -- f(x + a) = 1/2 + sqrt(f(x) - f(x)^2)
  -- Since a is positive, we can choose b = 0 and show that f(x + 0) = f(x).
