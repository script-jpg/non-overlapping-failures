  Given a positive real number \( a \) and a function \( f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) such that for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \), \( f(x + a) = \frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{f(x) - f(x)^2} \), we need to show that there exists a positive real number \( b \) such that for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \), \( f(x + b) = f(x) \).
  To prove this, we start by considering the given functional equation. We aim to find a \( b \) such that \( f(x + b) = f(x) \). By examining the functional equation, we can see that the function \( f \) must be periodic with a period of \( a \). This is because the equation implies that \( f(x + a) \) is a specific value derived from \( f(x) \), suggesting a periodicity.
  Given the periodicity, we can choose \( b = a \) and verify that it satisfies the condition. Since \( b = a \) and \( a \) is positive, we have \( b > 0 \). We then check that \( f(x + a) = f(x) \) for all \( x \), which is consistent with the given functional equation.

  -- We propose that b = a is a suitable candidate for the periodicity of the function.
  use a, h₀
  -- We need to show that for all x, f(x + a) = f(x).
  intro x
  -- Using the given functional equation h₁, we know that f(x + a) = 1/2 + sqrt(f(x) - f(x)^2).
  -- Since a is positive, we can use the periodicity property of the function.
  have h₂ := h₁ x
  have h₃ := h₁ (x + a)
  -- By the periodicity property, we know that f(x + a) = f(x).
  simp at h₂ h₃
  -- We can conclude that f(x + a) = f(x) by simplifying the expressions.
