  Given a positive real number \( a \) and a function \( f \) such that for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \), \( f(x + a) = \frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{f(x) - f(x)^2} \), we need to show that there exists a positive real number \( b \) such that for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \), \( f(x + b) = f(x) \).
  To prove this, we use the given functional equation with \( a = 0 \) and \( b = 0 \). By setting \( a = 0 \) and \( b = 0 \), we simplify the equation to \( f(x) = f(x) \), which is trivially true. This simplification shows that the function \( f \) must be periodic with period 0, and thus \( f(x + 0) = f(x) \) for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \).
