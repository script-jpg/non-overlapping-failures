  Given a positive real number \( a \) and a function \( f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) such that for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \), \( f(x + a) = \frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{f(x) - f(x)^2} \), we need to show that there exists a positive real number \( b \) such that \( f(x + b) = f(x) \) for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \).
  1. Start by setting \( b = a \).
  2. Verify that \( b = a \) is positive.
  3. For any \( x \in \mathbb{R} \), use the given functional equation to show that \( f(x + a) = f(x) \).

  -- We propose b = a as a solution.
  use a, h₀
  -- We need to show that for all x, f(x + a) = f(x).
  intro x
  -- Use the given functional equation to show that f(x + a) = f(x).
  have h₂ := h₁ x
  -- Simplify the expression to show that f(x + a) = f(x).
