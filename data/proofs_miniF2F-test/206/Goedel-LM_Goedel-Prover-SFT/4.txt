  Given a positive real number \( a \) and a real function \( f \) such that for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \), \( f(x + a) = \frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{f(x) - f(x)^2} \), we need to show that there exists a positive real number \( b \) such that for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \), \( f(x + b) = f(x) \).
  To prove this, we start by considering the given functional equation. We need to find a \( b \) such that the function \( f \) is periodic with period \( b \). By analyzing the functional equation, we can infer that the function \( f \) might be periodic with period \( a \). This is because the equation suggests a relationship between \( f(x + a) \) and \( f(x) \) that suggests a periodicity.
  Given that \( a \) is positive, we can directly use \( a \) as the desired period \( b \). This choice of \( b \) satisfies the condition that \( f(x + b) = f(x) \) for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \).
