  Given a positive real number \( a \) and a function \( f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) such that for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \), \( f(x + a) = \frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{f(x) - f(x)^2} \), we need to show that there exists a positive real number \( b \) such that for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \), \( f(x + b) = f(x) \).
  1. **Initial Consideration**: Start by noting that \( f \) is defined for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \).
  2. **Initial Value**: For any \( x \in \mathbb{R} \), consider the value of \( f \) at \( x \).
  3. **Functional Equation**: Use the given functional equation \( f(x + a) = \frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{f(x) - f(x)^2} \) to find a relationship involving \( f \).
  4. **Periodicity Argument**: To find a periodic \( b \), consider the value of \( f \) at \( x + a \). By the functional equation, \( f(x + a) = \frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{f(x) - f(x)^2} \). This implies that \( f \) must be periodic with period \( a \).
  5. **Conclusion**: Since \( f \) is periodic with period \( a \), we can choose \( b = a \) to satisfy the condition \( f(x + b) = f(x) \) for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \).

  -- We claim that the period b is a.
  use a, h₀
  -- For any x, we need to show that f(x + a) = f(x).
  intro x
  -- Use the given functional equation to find a relationship involving f.
  have h₂ := h₁ x
  -- Simplify the equation to find a relationship involving f.
