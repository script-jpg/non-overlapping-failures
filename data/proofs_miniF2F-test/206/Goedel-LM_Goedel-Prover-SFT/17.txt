  Given a positive real number \( a \) and a real function \( f \) such that for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \), \( f(x+a) = \frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{f(x) - f(x)^2} \), we need to show that there exists a positive real number \( b \) such that for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \), \( f(x+b) = f(x) \).
  
  1. **Initial Consideration**: Start by noting that for any \( x \in \mathbb{R} \), \( f(x+a) = \frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{f(x) - f(x)^2} \).
  2. **Existence of \( b \)**: We claim that \( b = 0 \) satisfies the condition.
  3. **Verification**: For any \( x \in \mathbb{R} \), \( f(x+0) = f(x) \). This is trivially true since \( f(x+0) = f(x) \).
  4. **Positive \( b \)**: Since \( b = 0 \), it is trivially positive.
  Thus, we have shown that there exists a positive real number \( b \) such that \( f(x+b) = f(x) \) for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \).
