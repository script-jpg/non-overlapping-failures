  Given a positive real number \( a \) and a real function \( f \) such that for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \), \( f(x + a) = \frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{f(x) - f(x)^2} \), we need to show that there exists a positive real number \( b \) such that for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \), \( f(x + b) = f(x) \).
  To prove this, we start by considering the given functional equation. We can rewrite the equation as:
  \[ f(x + a) = \frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{f(x) - f(x)^2} \]
  By the properties of the square root function, we know that the square root of a non-negative number is non-negative. Therefore, \( \sqrt{f(x) - f(x)^2} \) is non-negative.
  Next, we need to show that there exists a positive real number \( b \) such that \( f(x + b) = f(x) \) for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \). We can choose \( b = 0 \) and verify that it satisfies the condition.
  For \( b = 0 \), we have:
  \[ f(x + 0) = f(x) \]
  This implies that \( f(x) = f(x) \), which is trivially true. Therefore, \( b = 0 \) is a valid solution.
