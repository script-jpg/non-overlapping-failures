  Given a positive real number \( a \) and a real function \( f \) such that for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \), \( f(x + a) = \frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{f(x) - f(x)^2} \), we need to show that there exists a positive real number \( b \) such that for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \), \( f(x + b) = f(x) \).
  To prove this, we can use the given functional equation with \( a \) and \( b \) to show that \( f \) is periodic with period \( a \). Specifically, we will show that \( f(x + a) = f(x) \) for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \).

  -- We claim that the period b is a.
  use a, h₀
  -- We need to show that for all x, f(x + a) = f(x).
  intro x
  -- Using the given functional equation, we have:
  -- f(x + a) = 1/2 + sqrt(f(x) - f(x)^2)
  -- We can rewrite this as:
  -- f(x + a) = 1/2 + sqrt(f(x) - f(x)^2)
  -- To show f(x + a) = f(x), we need to show that the expression inside the square root is zero.
  have h₂ := h₁ x
  have h₃ := h₁ (x + a)
  -- Simplify the expressions to show that they are equal.
  simp at h₂ h₃
  -- Use the fact that the square root of zero is zero to conclude that f(x + a) = f(x).
