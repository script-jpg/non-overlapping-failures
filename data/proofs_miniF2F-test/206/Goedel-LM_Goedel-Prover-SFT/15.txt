  Given a positive real number \( a \) and a real function \( f \) such that for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \), \( f(x+a) = \frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{f(x) - f(x)^2} \), we aim to show that there exists a positive real number \( b \) such that for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \), \( f(x+b) = f(x) \).
  
  To achieve this, we use the given functional equation with \( a \) and \( x \) to derive a relationship involving \( f(x) \). Specifically, we show that \( f(x+a) = \frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{f(x) - f(x)^2} \) implies that \( f(x) \) must be a constant function. This is achieved by considering the behavior of \( f \) at specific points and using algebraic manipulations to establish the periodicity.
