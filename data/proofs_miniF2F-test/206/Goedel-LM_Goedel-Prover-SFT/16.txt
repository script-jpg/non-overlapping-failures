  Given a positive real number \( a \) and a real function \( f \) such that for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \), \( f(x + a) = \frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{f(x) - f(x)^2} \), we need to show that there exists a positive real number \( b \) such that for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \), \( f(x + b) = f(x) \).
  To prove this, we start by considering the given functional equation. We can rewrite the equation as:
  \[ f(x + a) = \frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{f(x) - f(x)^2} \]
  We need to find a \( b \) such that \( f(x + b) = f(x) \). We can use the fact that the square root function is idempotent, meaning \( \sqrt{y} = y \) for \( y \geq 0 \). Therefore, we can set \( b = a \) and show that this choice satisfies the condition.

  -- We need to show that a > 0 and for all x, f (x + a) = f x.

  -- Since a is given to be positive, we can directly use this fact.

  -- We need to verify that for all x, f (x + a) = f x.
  intro x
  -- Using the given functional equation h₁, we substitute x with x - a.
  have h₂ := h₁ (x - a)
  -- Simplify the expression to show that f (x - a + a) = f (x - a).
  simp at h₂
  -- Since a is positive, we can use the properties of the square root function to simplify the equation.
