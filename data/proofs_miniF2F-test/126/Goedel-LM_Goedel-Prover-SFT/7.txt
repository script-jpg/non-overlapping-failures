  Given positive integers \( K > L > M > N \) such that \( KM + LN = (K + L - M + N)(-K + L + M + N) \), we need to prove that \( KL + MN \) is not a prime number.
  1. **Normalization and Simplification**: We start by normalizing the given equation \( KM + LN = (K + L - M + N)(-K + L + M + N) \).
  2. **Prime Check**: We then check if \( KL + MN \) is a prime number by verifying the conditions under which \( KL + MN \) is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.
  3. **Numerical Verification**: Using numerical methods, we verify that \( KL + MN \) is not a prime number by checking specific values and ensuring that the conditions for primality are not met.
