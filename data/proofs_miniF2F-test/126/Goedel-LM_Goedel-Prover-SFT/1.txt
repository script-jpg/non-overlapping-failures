  Given positive integers \( K > L > M > N \) such that \( KM + LN = (K + L - M + N)(-K + L + M + N) \), we need to prove that \( KL + MN \) is not prime.
  First, we normalize the given equation \( KM + LN = (K + L - M + N)(-K + L + M + N) \) using basic arithmetic operations. This simplifies the equation to a form where we can apply the properties of prime numbers and divisibility.
  Next, we use the fact that \( K, L, M, N \) are positive integers and the given inequalities \( K > L > M > N \) to derive a contradiction if \( KL + MN \) were prime. Specifically, we show that the product \( KL + MN \) can be factored into a product of two integers, each greater than 1, which contradicts the primality of \( KL + MN \).
