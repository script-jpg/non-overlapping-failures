  Given positive integers \( K > L > M > N \) such that \( KM + LN = (K + L - M + N)(-K + L + M + N) \), we need to prove that \( KL + MN \) is not prime.
  1. Start by simplifying the given equation using the properties of addition and multiplication.
  2. Normalize the equation by expanding and simplifying it.
  3. Use the properties of prime numbers and the given constraints to derive the necessary conditions.
  4. Apply basic arithmetic and algebraic manipulations to show that \( KL + MN \) cannot be a prime number.
