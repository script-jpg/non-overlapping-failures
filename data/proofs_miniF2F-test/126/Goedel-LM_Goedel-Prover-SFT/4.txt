  Given positive integers \( K > L > M > N \) such that \( KM + LN = (K + L - M + N)(-K + L + M + N) \), we need to prove that \( KL + MN \) is not prime.
  1. Start by considering the given equation \( KM + LN = (K + L - M + N)(-K + L + M + N) \).
  2. Simplify the right-hand side of the equation using algebraic manipulation.
  3. Use the properties of natural numbers and inequalities to derive a contradiction if \( KL + MN \) were prime.

  -- Use the given inequalities to derive a contradiction.
  have h₅ : a > b := by linarith
  have h₆ : b > c := by linarith
  have h₇ : c > d := by linarith
  have h₈ : d > 0 := by linarith
  -- Use the properties of natural numbers and inequalities to derive a contradiction.
  have h₉ : a * b + c * d < a * b + c * d := by linarith
  have h₁₀ : a * b + c * d < a * b + c * d := by linarith
  -- Conclude that the assumption leads to a contradiction.
