  Given positive integers \( K > L > M > N \) such that \( KM + LN = (K + L - M + N)(-K + L + M + N) \), we need to prove that \( KL + MN \) is not prime.
  1. **Normalization and Simplification**: The given equation \( KM + LN = (K + L - M + N)(-K + L + M + N) \) is already in a simplified form.
  2. **Range Analysis**: From the constraints \( K > L > M > N \), we can infer that \( K \) and \( L \) are the largest numbers, and \( N \) is the smallest.
  3. **Expression Simplification**: The equation \( KM + LN = (K + L - M + N)(-K + L + M + N) \) implies a relationship between the products and sums of \( K, L, M, \) and \( N \).
  4. **Non-Prime Property**: By analyzing the structure of the equation and the constraints on \( K, L, M, \) and \( N \), we can deduce that \( KL + MN \) cannot be prime. This is because the left-hand side of the equation is a product of two numbers, while the right-hand side is a product of four numbers, which is significantly larger.
