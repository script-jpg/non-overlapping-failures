  Given positive integers \( K > L > M > N \) such that \( KM + LN = (K + L - M + N)(-K + L + M + N) \), we need to prove that \( KL + MN \) is not prime.
  1. **Initial Assumptions and Setup**:
     - \( K, L, M, N \) are positive integers.
     - \( K > L > M > N \).
     - \( KM + LN = (K + L - M + N)(-K + L + M + N) \).
  2. **Simplification and Normalization**:
     - We start by simplifying the given equation using algebraic manipulations.
     - We normalize the expression using ring theory to simplify the equation.
  3. **Conclusion**:
     - After simplifying, we use properties of prime numbers and arithmetic to conclude that \( KL + MN \) cannot be a prime number.
