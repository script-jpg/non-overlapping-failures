  Given positive integers \( K > L > M > N \) such that \( KM + LN = (K + L - M + N)(-K + L + M + N) \), we need to prove that \( KL + MN \) is not prime.
  
  1. Start by simplifying the given equation using algebraic manipulations.
  2. Use the properties of natural numbers and inequalities to derive a contradiction if \( KL + MN \) were prime.
  3. Apply the `omega` tactic to solve the resulting linear arithmetic problem, which will show that \( KL + MN \) cannot be prime.
