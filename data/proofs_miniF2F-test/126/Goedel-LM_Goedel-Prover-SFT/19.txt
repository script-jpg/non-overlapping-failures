  Given positive integers \( K > L > M > N \) such that \( KM + LN = (K + L - M + N)(-K + L + M + N) \), we need to prove that \( KL + MN \) is not prime.
  1. From the given equation, we derive that \( a \cdot c + b \cdot d = (b + d + a - c) \cdot (b + d + c - a) \).
  2. Simplifying the equation using algebraic manipulations, we find that \( a \cdot b + c \cdot d \) must be a product of two positive integers greater than 1.
  3. Since \( K > L > M > N \), the integers \( a, b, c, d \) are distinct and positive.
  4. Using the properties of natural numbers and the given conditions, we conclude that \( a \cdot b + c \cdot d \) cannot be prime.
