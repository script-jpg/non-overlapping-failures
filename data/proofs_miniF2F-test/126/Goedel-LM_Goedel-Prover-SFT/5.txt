  Given positive integers \( K > L > M > N \) such that \( KM + LN = (K + L - M + N)(-K + L + M + N) \), we need to prove that \( KL + MN \) is not prime.
  1. Start by considering the given equation \( KM + LN = (K + L - M + N)(-K + L + M + N) \).
  2. Expand and simplify the right-hand side of the equation.
  3. Use the properties of natural numbers and the given inequalities to derive a contradiction if \( KL + MN \) were prime.
  4. Conclude that \( KL + MN \) cannot be prime.
