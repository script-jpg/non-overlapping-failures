  Given positive integers \( K > L > M > N \) such that \( KM + LN = (K + L - M + N)(-K + L + M + N) \), we need to prove that \( KL + MN \) is not prime.
  1. Start by simplifying the given equation using algebraic manipulations.
  2. Normalize the equation to isolate terms involving \( K, L, M, \) and \( N \).
  3. Use the properties of natural numbers and the given inequalities to derive a contradiction if \( KL + MN \) were prime.
