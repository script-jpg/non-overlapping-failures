  Given positive integers \( K > L > M > N \) such that \( KM + LN = (K + L - M + N)(-K + L + M + N) \), we need to prove that \( KL + MN \) is not prime. We start by simplifying the given equation using basic arithmetic properties and then check for divisibility by 2, 3, and 5 to show that \( KL + MN \) is not prime.
