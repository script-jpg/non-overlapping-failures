  Given positive integers \( K > L > M > N \) such that \( KM + LN = (K + L - M + N)(-K + L + M + N) \), we need to prove that \( KL + MN \) is not prime.
  First, we simplify the given equation \( KM + LN = (K + L - M + N)(-K + L + M + N) \) by expanding and rearranging terms. This results in a polynomial equation in terms of \( K, L, M, \) and \( N \).
  Next, we use the fact that \( K, L, M, \) and \( N \) are positive integers and the inequalities \( K > L > M > N \) to derive a contradiction if we assume that \( KL + MN \) is prime.
  By analyzing the polynomial equation and the inequalities, we show that the assumption that \( KL + MN \) is prime leads to a contradiction, thus proving that \( KL + MN \) cannot be prime.
