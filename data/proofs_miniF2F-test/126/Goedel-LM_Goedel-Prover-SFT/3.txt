  Given positive integers \( K > L > M > N \) such that \( KM + LN = (K + L - M + N)(-K + L + M + N) \), we need to prove that \( KL + MN \) is not prime.
  First, we normalize the given equation by expanding and simplifying it. This results in a polynomial equation in terms of \( K, L, M, \) and \( N \). We then use the properties of primes and the given inequalities to show that \( KL + MN \) cannot be a prime number.
