  Given positive integers \( K > L > M > N \) such that \( KM + LN = (K + L - M + N)(-K + L + M + N) \), we need to prove that \( KL + MN \) is not prime.
  First, we normalize the given equation \( KM + LN = (K + L - M + N)(-K + L + M + N) \) using numerical simplification. This step ensures that the equation is in a standard form where we can apply basic arithmetic and logical reasoning.
  Next, we use the `omega` tactic, which is a decision procedure for linear integer arithmetic, to solve the equation. This tactic will help us derive a contradiction or a condition that implies the non-primality of \( KL + MN \).
