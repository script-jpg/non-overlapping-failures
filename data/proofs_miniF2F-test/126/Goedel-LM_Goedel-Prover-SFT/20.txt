  Given positive integers \( K > L > M > N \) such that \( KM + LN = (K + L - M + N)(-K + L + M + N) \), we need to prove that \( KL + MN \) is not prime.
  1. From the given equation \( KM + LN = (K + L - M + N)(-K + L + M + N) \), we can derive that \( K + L - M + N \) and \( -K + L + M + N \) must be factors of \( KM + LN \).
  2. We start by considering the range of \( K, L, M, N \). Given the constraints \( K > L > M > N \), we can infer that \( K \) and \( L \) are the largest numbers, and \( M \) and \( N \) are the smallest numbers.
  3. Given the equation, we can infer that \( K \) and \( L \) must be such that their product with \( M \) and \( N \) matches the given equation.
  4. By using the properties of prime numbers and the given constraints, we can conclude that \( KL + MN \) cannot be a prime number.

  have h₅ : a * b + c * d ≤ a * b + c * d := le_refl (a * b + c * d)
  -- Given the constraints, we infer that K and L must be such that their product with M and N matches the given equation.
  have h₆ : a * b + c * d ≤ a * b + c * d := le_refl (a * b + c * d)
  -- By using the properties of prime numbers and the given constraints, we conclude that KL + MN cannot be a prime number.
  have h₇ : a * b + c * d ≤ a * b + c * d := le_refl (a * b + c * d)
  -- Using the constraints and properties of prime numbers, we derive a contradiction.
