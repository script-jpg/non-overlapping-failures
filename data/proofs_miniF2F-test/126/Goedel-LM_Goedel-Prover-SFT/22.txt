  Given positive integers \( K > L > M > N \) such that \( KM + LN = (K + L - M + N)(-K + L + M + N) \), we need to prove that \( KL + MN \) is not prime.
  From the given equation \( KM + LN = (K + L - M + N)(-K + L + M + N) \), we can derive that \( KL + MN \) is not prime by showing that it is not a product of two distinct primes. Specifically, we will demonstrate that \( KL + MN \) can be expressed as a product of two integers, neither of which is 1, thus confirming that it is not prime.
