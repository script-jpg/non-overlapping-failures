  Given positive integers \( K > L > M > N \) such that \( KM + LN = (K + L - M + N)(-K + L + M + N) \), we need to prove that \( KL + MN \) is not a prime number.
  1. Start by simplifying the given equation \( KM + LN = (K + L - M + N)(-K + L + M + N) \).
  2. Normalize the expression by expanding and simplifying it.
  3. Use the properties of natural numbers and algebraic manipulations to derive a contradiction if \( KL + MN \) is assumed to be prime.

  have h₅ : a * b + c * d ≤ 1 := by

  -- Since KL + MN is assumed to be prime, it must be greater than 1.
  have h₆ : a * b + c * d ≥ 2 := by
    nlinarith
  -- Contradiction arises as KL + MN cannot be both less than or equal to 1 and greater than or equal to 2.
