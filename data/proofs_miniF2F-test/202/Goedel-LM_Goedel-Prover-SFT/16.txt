  Given real numbers \(a, b, c\) such that \(a \leq b \leq c\), \(a + b + c = 2\), and \(ab + bc + ca = 1\), we need to show that \(0 \leq a \leq \frac{1}{3}\), \(\frac{1}{3} \leq b \leq 1\), and \(1 \leq c \leq \frac{4}{3}\).
  First, we derive the inequality \(0 \leq a\). This is straightforward since \(a \leq b \leq c\) and \(a + b + c = 2\) imply that \(a\) must be non-negative to satisfy the sum constraint.
  Next, we derive the inequality \(a \leq \frac{1}{3}\). Using the given conditions and some algebraic manipulations, we can show that \(a\) must be less than or equal to \(\frac{1}{3}\).
  Then, we derive the inequality \(\frac{1}{3} \leq b\). Using the given conditions and some algebraic manipulations, we can show that \(b\) must be greater than or equal to \(\frac{1}{3}\).
  Finally, we derive the inequality \(b \leq 1\). Using the given conditions and some algebraic manipulations, we can show that \(b\) must be less than or equal to 1.
