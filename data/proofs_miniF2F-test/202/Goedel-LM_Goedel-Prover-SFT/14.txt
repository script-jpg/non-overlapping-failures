  Given real numbers \(a, b, c\) such that \(a \leq b \leq c\), \(a + b + c = 2\), and \(ab + bc + ca = 1\), we need to show that \(0 \leq a \leq \frac{1}{3}\), \(\frac{1}{3} \leq b \leq 1\), and \(1 \leq c \leq \frac{4}{3}\).
  To prove this, we use the given conditions and some algebraic manipulations. First, we note that the sum of squares of differences between the variables is non-negative. We then use this fact along with the given conditions to derive the required inequalities.
