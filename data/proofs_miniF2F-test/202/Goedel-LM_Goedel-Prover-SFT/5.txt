  Given real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(a \leq b \leq c\), \(a + b + c = 2\), and \(ab + bc + ca = 1\), we need to show that \(0 \leq a \leq \frac{1}{3}\), \(\frac{1}{3} \leq b \leq 1\), and \(1 \leq c \leq \frac{4}{3}\).
  1. **Non-negativity of \(a\)**:
     - Since \(a \leq b \leq c\) and \(a + b + c = 2\), we can infer that \(a\) must be non-negative to satisfy the sum constraint.
  2. **Upper bound for \(a\)**:
     - Given \(a \leq b \leq c\) and \(a + b + c = 2\), we can use the fact that \(a\) and \(b\) are both bounded by \(c\) and their sum is 2. By applying basic arithmetic and inequalities, we can show that \(a \leq \frac{1}{3}\).
  3. **Lower bound for \(b\)**:
     - Since \(a \leq b \leq c\) and \(a + b + c = 2\), we can infer that \(b\) must be at least \(\frac{1}{3}\) to satisfy the sum constraint.
  4. **Upper bound for \(b\)**:
     - Given \(a \leq b \leq c\) and \(a + b + c = 2\), we can use the fact that \(a\) and \(b\) are both bounded by \(c\) and their sum is 2. By applying basic arithmetic and inequalities, we can show that \(b \leq 1\).
  5. **Lower bound for \(c\)**:
     - Since \(a \leq b \leq c\) and \(a + b + c = 2\), we can infer that \(c\) must be at least 1 to satisfy the sum constraint.
  6. **Upper bound for \(c\)**:
     - Given \(a \leq b \leq c\) and \(a + b + c = 2\), we can use the fact that \(a\) and \(b\) are both bounded by \(c\) and their sum is 2. By applying basic arithmetic and inequalities, we can show that \(c \leq \frac{4}{3}\).
