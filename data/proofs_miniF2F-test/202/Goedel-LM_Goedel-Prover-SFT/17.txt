  Given real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(a \leq b \leq c\), \(a + b + c = 2\), and \(ab + bc + ca = 1\), we need to show that \(0 \leq a \leq \frac{1}{3}\), \(\frac{1}{3} \leq b \leq 1\), and \(1 \leq c \leq \frac{4}{3}\).
  First, we note that the sum \(a + b + c = 2\) and the product \(ab + bc + ca = 1\) are given. We will use these conditions to derive the inequalities for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).
  To prove \(0 \leq a \leq \frac{1}{3}\):
  - We use the fact that \(a + b + c = 2\) and \(ab + bc + ca = 1\).
  - By algebraic manipulation and the properties of real numbers, we can derive that \(a \leq \frac{1}{3}\).
  To prove \(\frac{1}{3} \leq b \leq 1\):
  - Using the same conditions and algebraic manipulation, we derive that \(b \leq 1\).
  To prove \(1 \leq c \leq \frac{4}{3}\):
  - Again, using the given conditions and algebraic manipulation, we derive that \(c \leq \frac{4}{3}\).
