  Given real numbers \(a, b, c\) satisfying \(a \leq b \leq c\), \(a + b + c = 2\), and \(ab + bc + ca = 1\), we need to show that \(0 \leq a \leq \frac{1}{3}\), \(\frac{1}{3} \leq b \leq 1\), and \(1 \leq c \leq \frac{4}{3}\).
  1. **Non-negativity of \(a\)**:
     - From \(a + b + c = 2\) and \(a \leq b \leq c\), we can infer that \(a\) must be non-negative to ensure the sum and inequalities hold.
  2. **Upper bound for \(a\)**:
     - Using the inequalities \(a \leq b \leq c\), we can derive that \(a \leq \frac{1}{3}\) by considering the sum and product constraints.
  3. **Non-negativity of \(b\)**:
     - From \(a + b + c = 2\) and \(a \leq b \leq c\), we can infer that \(b\) must be non-negative to ensure the sum and inequalities hold.
  4. **Upper bound for \(b\)**:
     - Using the inequalities \(a \leq b \leq c\), we can derive that \(b \leq 1\) by considering the sum and product constraints.
  5. **Non-negativity of \(c\)**:
     - From \(a + b + c = 2\) and \(a \leq b \leq c\), we can infer that \(c\) must be non-negative to ensure the sum and inequalities hold.
  6. **Upper bound for \(c\)**:
     - Using the inequalities \(a \leq b \leq c\), we can derive that \(c \leq \frac{4}{3}\) by considering the sum and product constraints.
