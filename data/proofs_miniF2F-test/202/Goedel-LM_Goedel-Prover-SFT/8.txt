  Given real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(a \leq b \leq c\), \(a + b + c = 2\), and \(ab + bc + ca = 1\), we need to show that \(0 \leq a \leq \frac{1}{3}\), \(\frac{1}{3} \leq b \leq 1\), and \(1 \leq c \leq \frac{4}{3}\).
  1. **Non-negativity of \(a\)**:
     - From \(a + b + c = 2\) and \(ab + bc + ca = 1\), we can infer that \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are non-negative.
     - Using the inequalities \(a \leq b \leq c\) and the sum conditions, we can deduce that \(a\) must be non-negative.
  2. **Upper bound for \(a\)**:
     - Using the sum \(a + b + c = 2\) and the product condition \(ab + bc + ca = 1\), we can derive that \(a \leq \frac{1}{3}\).
     - This is because if \(a > \frac{1}{3}\), the sum \(a + b + c\) would exceed 2, contradicting the given sum condition.
  3. **Lower bound for \(b\)**:
     - From \(a + b + c = 2\) and \(ab + bc + ca = 1\), we can derive that \(b \geq \frac{1}{3}\).
     - This is because if \(b < \frac{1}{3}\), the product \(ab + bc + ca\) would be less than 1, contradicting the given product condition.
  4. **Upper bound for \(b\)**:
     - From \(a + b + c = 2\) and \(ab + bc + ca = 1\), we can derive that \(b \leq 1\).
     - This is because if \(b > 1\), the sum \(a + b + c\) would exceed 2, contradicting the given sum condition.
  5. **Lower bound for \(c\)**:
     - From \(a + b + c = 2\) and \(ab + bc + ca = 1\), we can derive that \(c \geq 1\).
     - This is because if \(c < 1\), the product \(ab + bc + ca\) would be less than 1, contradicting the given product condition.
  6. **Upper bound for \(c\)**:
     - From \(a + b + c = 2\) and \(ab + bc + ca = 1\), we can derive that \(c \leq \frac{4}{3}\).
     - This is because if \(c > \frac{4}{3}\), the sum \(a + b + c\) would exceed 2, contradicting the given sum condition.
