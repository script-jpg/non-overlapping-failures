  Given real numbers \(a, b, c\) such that \(a \leq b \leq c\), \(a + b + c = 2\), and \(ab + bc + ca = 1\), we need to show that \(0 \leq a \leq \frac{1}{3}\), \(\frac{1}{3} \leq b \leq 1\), and \(1 \leq c \leq \frac{4}{3}\).
  1. **Lower Bound for \(a\)**:
     - Using the inequalities \(a \leq b \leq c\) and \(a + b + c = 2\), we can infer that \(a\) must be non-negative to satisfy the sum constraint.
  2. **Upper Bound for \(a\)**:
     - From the equation \(ab + bc + ca = 1\), we can derive that \(a\) must be less than or equal to \(\frac{1}{3}\) to ensure the sum of products is 1.
  3. **Lower Bound for \(b\)**:
     - Given \(a \leq b \leq c\) and \(a + b + c = 2\), we can infer that \(b\) must be at least \(\frac{1}{3}\) to ensure the sum constraint is satisfied.
  4. **Upper Bound for \(b\)**:
     - From the equation \(ab + bc + ca = 1\), we can derive that \(b\) must be less than or equal to 1 to ensure the sum of products is 1.
  5. **Lower Bound for \(c\)**:
     - Given \(a \leq b \leq c\) and \(a + b + c = 2\), we can infer that \(c\) must be at least 1 to ensure the sum constraint is satisfied.
  6. **Upper Bound for \(c\)**:
     - From the equation \(ab + bc + ca = 1\), we can derive that \(c\) must be less than or equal to \(\frac{4}{3}\) to ensure the sum of products is 1.
