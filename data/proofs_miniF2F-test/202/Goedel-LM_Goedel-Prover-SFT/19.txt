  Given real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(a \leq b \leq c\), \(a + b + c = 2\), and \(ab + bc + ca = 1\), we need to show that \(0 \leq a \leq \frac{1}{3}\), \(\frac{1}{3} \leq b \leq 1\), and \(1 \leq c \leq \frac{4}{3}\).
  1. **Non-negativity of \(a\)**:
     - Using the given inequalities \(a \leq b \leq c\) and \(a + b + c = 2\), we can infer that \(a\) must be non-negative to satisfy the sum constraint.
  2. **Upper bound for \(a\)**:
     - From the inequality \(a \leq b \leq c\) and the sum constraint \(a + b + c = 2\), we can derive that \(a \leq \frac{1}{3}\) to satisfy the product constraint \(ab + bc + ca = 1\).
  3. **Lower bound for \(b\)**:
     - Using the inequality \(a \leq b \leq c\) and the sum constraint \(a + b + c = 2\), we can derive that \(b \geq \frac{1}{3}\) to satisfy the product constraint \(ab + bc + ca = 1\).
  4. **Upper bound for \(c\)**:
     - Using the inequality \(a \leq b \leq c\) and the sum constraint \(a + b + c = 2\), we can derive that \(c \leq \frac{4}{3}\) to satisfy the product constraint \(ab + bc + ca = 1\).
