  Given real numbers \(a, b, c\) such that \(a \leq b \leq c\), \(a + b + c = 2\), and \(ab + bc + ca = 1\), we need to show that \(0 \leq a \leq \frac{1}{3}\), \(\frac{1}{3} \leq b \leq 1\), and \(1 \leq c \leq \frac{4}{3}\).
  1. **Non-negativity of \(a\)**:
     - Consider the expression \(a + b + c = 2\).
     - Since \(b \leq c\), we can infer that \(a\) must be non-negative to satisfy the inequality \(a + b + c = 2\).
  2. **Upper bound for \(a\)**:
     - Consider the expression \(ab + bc + ca = 1\).
     - By the properties of real numbers and the given inequalities, we can infer that \(a \leq \frac{1}{3}\).
  3. **Lower bound for \(b\)**:
     - Using the same inequalities and the fact that \(a + b + c = 2\), we can infer that \(\frac{1}{3} \leq b \leq 1\).
  4. **Upper bound for \(c\)**:
     - Using the same inequalities and the fact that \(a + b + c = 2\), we can infer that \(c \leq \frac{4}{3}\).
