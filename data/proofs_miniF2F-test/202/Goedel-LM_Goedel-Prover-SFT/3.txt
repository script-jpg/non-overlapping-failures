  Given real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(a \leq b \leq c\), \(a + b + c = 2\), and \(ab + bc + ca = 1\), we need to show that \(0 \leq a \leq \frac{1}{3}\), \(\frac{1}{3} \leq b \leq 1\), and \(1 \leq c \leq \frac{4}{3}\).
  1. **Non-negativity of \(a\)**:
     - Since \(a \leq b \leq c\) and \(a + b + c = 2\), we can infer that \(a\) must be non-negative because the sum of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is 2.
  2. **Upper bound for \(a\)**:
     - Using the given conditions \(a \leq b \leq c\) and \(ab + bc + ca = 1\), we can derive that \(a \leq \frac{1}{3}\) by considering the maximum values of \(b\) and \(c\) and the sum constraint.
  3. **Lower bound for \(b\)**:
     - Since \(a \leq b \leq c\) and \(a + b + c = 2\), we can infer that \(b\) must be at least \(\frac{1}{3}\) to satisfy the sum constraint.
  4. **Upper bound for \(b\)**:
     - Using the given conditions \(a \leq b \leq c\) and \(ab + bc + ca = 1\), we can derive that \(b \leq 1\) by considering the maximum values of \(a\) and \(c\) and the sum constraint.
  5. **Lower bound for \(c\)**:
     - Since \(a \leq b \leq c\) and \(a + b + c = 2\), we can infer that \(c\) must be at least 1 to satisfy the sum constraint.
  6. **Upper bound for \(c\)**:
     - Using the given conditions \(a \leq b \leq c\) and \(ab + bc + ca = 1\), we can derive that \(c \leq \frac{4}{3}\) by considering the maximum values of \(a\) and \(b\) and the sum constraint.
