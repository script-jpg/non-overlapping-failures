  Given real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(a \leq b \leq c\), \(a + b + c = 2\), and \(ab + bc + ca = 1\), we need to show that \(0 \leq a \leq \frac{1}{3}\), \(\frac{1}{3} \leq b \leq 1\), and \(1 \leq c \leq \frac{4}{3}\).
  First, we note that the sum of the squares of the differences between the variables is non-negative: \((a - b)^2 + (b - c)^2 + (c - a)^2 \geq 0\). Expanding this, we get:
  \[
  (a - b)^2 + (b - c)^2 + (c - a)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2 + b^2 - 2bc + c^2 + c^2 - 2ca + a^2 = 2a^2 + 2b^2 + 2c^2 - 2ab - 2bc - 2ca.
  \]
  Given \(a + b + c = 2\), we can use this to bound the individual terms. By the properties of squares and the given conditions, we can derive the required inequalities.
