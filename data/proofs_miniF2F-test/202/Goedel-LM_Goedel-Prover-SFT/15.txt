  Given real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(a \leq b \leq c\), \(a + b + c = 2\), and \(ab + bc + ca = 1\), we need to show that \(0 \leq a \leq \frac{1}{3}\), \(\frac{1}{3} \leq b \leq 1\), and \(1 \leq c \leq \frac{4}{3}\).
  First, we derive the lower bound for \(a\). Using the given conditions, we can infer that \(a\) must be non-negative to satisfy the inequalities and equalities.
  Next, we derive the upper bound for \(a\). By leveraging the given conditions and the properties of real numbers, we can show that \(a\) must be less than or equal to \(\frac{1}{3}\).
  For \(b\), we derive the lower bound. Given the inequalities \(a \leq b \leq c\) and the equality \(a + b + c = 2\), we can infer that \(b\) must be at least \(\frac{1}{3}\) to balance the sum with \(a\) and \(c\).
  For \(b\), we derive the upper bound. Using the given conditions and the properties of real numbers, we can show that \(b\) must be less than or equal to 1.
  For \(c\), we derive the lower bound. Given the inequalities \(a \leq b \leq c\) and the equality \(a + b + c = 2\), we can infer that \(c\) must be at least 1 to balance the sum with \(a\) and \(b\).
  For \(c\), we derive the upper bound. Using the given conditions and the properties of real numbers, we can show that \(c\) must be less than or equal to \(\frac{4}{3}\).
