  Given real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(a \leq b \leq c\), \(a + b + c = 2\), and \(ab + bc + ca = 1\), we need to show that \(0 \leq a \leq \frac{1}{3}\), \(\frac{1}{3} \leq b \leq 1\), and \(1 \leq c \leq \frac{4}{3}\).
  First, we establish the lower bound for \(a\). Using the given conditions, we can derive the inequality \(a \leq \frac{1}{3}\) by leveraging the properties of real numbers and algebraic manipulations. Specifically, we use the fact that the sum of the products of the numbers is 1 and the sum of the numbers is 2, which helps in bounding \(a\).
  Next, we establish the upper bound for \(a\). Using the same conditions, we derive the inequality \(a \leq \frac{1}{3}\). This is achieved by leveraging the same algebraic properties and the given conditions.
  Then, we establish the lower bound for \(b\). Using the given conditions and the properties of real numbers, we derive the inequality \(b \geq \frac{1}{3}\).
  Finally, we establish the upper bound for \(b\). Using the given conditions and the properties of real numbers, we derive the inequality \(b \leq 1\).
