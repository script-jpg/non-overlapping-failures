  Given real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(a \leq b \leq c\), \(a + b + c = 2\), and \(ab + bc + ca = 1\), we need to show that \(0 \leq a \leq \frac{1}{3}\), \(\frac{1}{3} \leq b \leq 1\), and \(1 \leq c \leq \frac{4}{3}\).
  To prove this, we use the given conditions and apply basic algebraic manipulations and inequalities. Specifically, we use the fact that the sum of the numbers is 2 and the sum of their products is 1. We can use these conditions to derive the bounds for each number.
