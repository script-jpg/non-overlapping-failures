  Given real numbers \(a, b, c\) such that \(a \leq b \leq c\), \(a + b + c = 2\), and \(ab + bc + ca = 1\), we need to show that \(0 \leq a \leq \frac{1}{3}\), \(\frac{1}{3} \leq b \leq 1\), and \(1 \leq c \leq \frac{4}{3}\).
  1. **Lower Bound for \(a\)**:
     - From the given conditions, we know \(a + b + c = 2\).
     - Since \(a \leq b \leq c\), we can infer that \(a\) must be non-negative to satisfy the sum and the ordering conditions.
  2. **Upper Bound for \(a\)**:
     - Using the inequalities \(a \leq b \leq c\), we can derive the upper bound for \(a\) by considering the sum and the product conditions.
     - Specifically, \(a\) must be less than or equal to \(\frac{1}{3}\) to satisfy the sum \(a + b + c = 2\) and the product \(ab + bc + ca = 1\).
  3. **Lower Bound for \(b\)**:
     - Since \(a \leq b \leq c\), and knowing \(a + b + c = 2\), we can infer that \(b\) must be at least \(\frac{1}{3}\) to balance the sum and the product conditions.
  4. **Upper Bound for \(b\)**:
     - Using the inequalities \(a \leq b \leq c\), we can derive the upper bound for \(b\) by considering the sum and the product conditions.
     - Specifically, \(b\) must be less than or equal to 1 to satisfy the sum \(a + b + c = 2\) and the product \(ab + bc + ca = 1\).
  5. **Lower Bound for \(c\)**:
     - Since \(a \leq b \leq c\), and knowing \(a + b + c = 2\), we can infer that \(c\) must be at least \(\frac{4}{3}\) to balance the sum and the product conditions.
  6. **Upper Bound for \(c\)**:
     - Using the inequalities \(a \leq b \leq c\), we can derive the upper bound for \(c\) by considering the sum and the product conditions.
     - Specifically, \(c\) must be less than or equal to \(\frac{4}{3}\) to satisfy the sum \(a + b + c = 2\) and the product \(ab + bc + ca = 1\).
