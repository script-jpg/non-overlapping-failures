  Given real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(a \leq b \leq c\), \(a + b + c = 2\), and \(ab + bc + ca = 1\), we need to show that \(0 \leq a \leq \frac{1}{3}\), \(\frac{1}{3} \leq b \leq 1\), and \(1 \leq c \leq \frac{4}{3}\).
  First, we derive the inequality \(0 \leq a\) by considering the non-negativity of the squares of the differences \(b - c\), \(c - a\), and \(a - b\). Using the given conditions \(a + b + c = 2\) and \(ab + bc + ca = 1\), we can apply algebraic manipulations and inequalities to show that \(a\) must be non-negative.
  Next, we derive the inequality \(a \leq \frac{1}{3}\) by again using the given conditions and algebraic manipulations. We use the fact that the sum of the squares of the differences \(b - c\), \(c - a\), and \(a - b\) is non-negative to bound \(a\).
  Then, we derive the inequality \(\frac{1}{3} \leq b\) by considering the non-negativity of the squares of the differences \(b - c\), \(c - a\), and \(a - b\). Using the given conditions \(a + b + c = 2\) and \(ab + bc + ca = 1\), we can apply algebraic manipulations and inequalities to show that \(b\) must be at least \(\frac{1}{3}\).
  Finally, we derive the inequality \(b \leq 1\) by again using the given conditions and algebraic manipulations. We use the fact that the sum of the squares of the differences \(b - c\), \(c - a\), and \(a - b\) is non-negative to bound \(b\).
