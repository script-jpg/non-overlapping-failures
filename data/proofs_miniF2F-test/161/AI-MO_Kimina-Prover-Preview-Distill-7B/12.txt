-- Today a father's age is five times his son's age. They are both older than 0. Three years ago, the sum of their ages was 30. How old is the son today? Show that it is 6.
  -- The final answer is $ \boxed{6} $

  -- The integer programming problem is translated to an arithmetic problem.

  -- Now we have this integer programming problem:
  -- $x + y = 33$
  -- $x > 0, y > 0$
  -- $5x = y$
  -- And we want to prove that $x = 6$.
