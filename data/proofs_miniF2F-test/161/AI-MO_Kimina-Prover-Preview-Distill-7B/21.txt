-- This is a system of two equations in two indeterminates x, y.

  -- We solve it by substituting the first equation into the second.

  rw [h₁] at h₂

  -- After substitution, we get an equation in x only. Let's rearrange it.

  have : 6 * (x : ℤ) = 33 := by linarith

  -- Let's simplify it.

  have : 2 * (x : ℤ) = 11 := by linarith

  -- This equation has no integer solutions. Let's prove that x = 6.

  suffices x = 6 by exact this

  -- Let's show that x can't be too large or too small.

  have h₃ : x ≤ 11 := by omega

  have h₄ : x ≥ 5 := by omega

  -- We check all possible values of x.

  interval_cases x

  -- None of them satisfy the equation, so x = 6 is the only solution.
