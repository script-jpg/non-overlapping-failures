-- This is a fun algebra problem!

  -- A father's age is five times his son's age: $x = 5y$.
  -- Three years ago, the sum of their ages was 30: $(x-3)+(y-3)=30$.
  -- How old is the son today?

  have : x = 6 := by

    -- A father's age is five times his son's age: $x = 5y$.
    have h₃ : y = 5 * x := by omega

    -- Three years ago, the sum of their ages was 30: $(x-3)+(y-3)=30$.
    have h₄ : x + y - 6 = 30 := by

      have : (x : ℤ) - 3 + (y - 3) = 30 := by norm_cast at h₂; exact_mod_cast h₂
      omega

    -- Substituting $y=5x$ into $x+y-6=30$, we get $x+5x-6=30$.
    subst h₃
    -- Simplifying, we get $6x-6=30$.
    omega

  -- The answer is $ \boxed{6} $.
