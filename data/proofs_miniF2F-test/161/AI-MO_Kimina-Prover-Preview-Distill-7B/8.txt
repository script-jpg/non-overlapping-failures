-- Today a father's age is five times his son's age. The father's age is $x$ and the son's age is $y$.
  -- This means that $5x = y$.
  have h₃ : 5 * x = y := h₁

  -- Exactly three years ago, the sum of their ages was 30.
  -- This means that $(x - 3) + (y - 3) = 30$.
  have h₄ : ↑x - (3 : ℤ) + (y - (3 : ℤ)) = 30 := h₂

  -- Simplifying, we get $x + y = 36$.
  have h₅ : x + y = 36 := by
    zify
    linarith

  -- We know that $5x = y$ and $x + y = 36$.
  -- Substituting $y = 5x$ into $x + y = 36$, we get $6x = 36$.
  have h₆ : x + 5 * x = 36 := by
    rw [← h₃]
    exact h₅

  -- This means that $x = 6$.
  have h₇ : x = 6 := by omega

  -- So the son is 6 years old today.
