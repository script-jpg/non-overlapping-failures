-- Today a father's age is five times his son's age. The son cannot be 0 years old, as
  -- three years ago he was -3 years old, and age cannot be negative. Therefore the
  -- father must be at least 5 years old.
  have : 5 ≤ x := by omega

  -- Therefore the father's age $x$ is 6, 7, 8,... and correspondingly the son's
  -- age $y$ is 30, 35, 40,...
  have : x = 6 ∧ y = 30 ∨ x = 7 ∧ y = 35 ∨ x = 8 ∧ y = 40 := by omega

  -- Exactly three years ago, the sum of their ages was 30. The only possibility
  -- is that the father was 33 years old and the son was 7 years old three years
  -- ago, and now the father is 6 + 3 = 9 years old and the son is 7 + 3 = 10
  -- years old, but this contradicts the first statement.
  rcases this with ⟨hx, hy⟩ | ⟨hx, hy⟩ | ⟨hx, hy⟩ <;> omega
