/- Today a father's age is five times his son's age. -/

  /- Exactly three years ago, the sum of their ages was 30. How old is the son today? -/
```

We have two variables $x$ (father's current age) and $y$ (son's current age), with the following conditions:
1. $x > 0$ and $y > 0$ (ages are positive)
2. $5x = y$ (father's age is five times son's age)
3. $x - 3 + (y - 3) = 30$ (sum of their ages three years ago was 30)

Let's solve this algebraically first:
From $5x = y$, we have $y = 5x$
Substituting into the third equation: $x - 3 + (5x - 3) = 30$
Simplifying: $x - 3 + 5x - 3 = 30$
$6x - 6 = 30$
$6x = 36$
$x = 6$

So the son's age is $y = 5x = 5 \cdot 6 = 30$.

Let's implement this in Lean 4:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

Now we'll define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_125 (x y : ℕ) (h₀ : 0 < x ∧ 0 < y) (h₁ : 5 * x = y)
    (h₂ : ↑x - (3 : ℤ) + (y - (3 : ℤ)) = 30) : x = 6 := by
```

We have the theorem statement with:
- $x$ and $y$ are natural numbers (ages)
- $h₀$: $x > 0$ and $y > 0$
- $h₁$: $5x = y$
- $h₂$: $x - 3 + (y - 3) = 30$ (after casting to integers)

Now we'll solve it. From $h₁$, we have $y = 5x$. Substituting into $h₂$:
$x - 3 + (5x - 3) = 30$
$6x - 6 = 30$
$6x = 36$
$x = 6$

Let's complete the proof:

```tactics
have h3 : x = 6 := by
  omega
```

The `omega` tactic is powerful enough to solve arithmetic goals involving natural numbers. It will:
1. From $h₁$: derive that $y = 5x$
2. From $h₂$: after casting to integers, derive $x - 3 + (y - 3) = 30$
3. Substitute $y = 5x$ into the equation to get $x - 3 + (5x - 3) = 30$
4. Simplify to $6x - 6 = 30$
5. Solve to get $6x = 36$
6. Divide by 6 to get $x = 6$

Now we can complete the proof:

```tactics
exact h3
```

So our complete proof shows that $x = 6$, meaning the son is 6 years old today.
