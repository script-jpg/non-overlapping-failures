The theorem states that given:
- `x` is the father's current age
- `y` is the son's current age
- `h₀`: Both ages are positive
- `h₁`: The father's age is 5 times the son's age
- `h₂`: Three years ago, the sum of their ages was 30

We need to prove that the son is 6 years old.

Let's think about how to solve this algebraically first:
- From h₁: $x = 5y$
- From h₂: $x - 3 + y - 3 = 30$
- Substituting $x = 5y$ into h₂: $5y - 3 + y - 3 = 30$
- Simplifying: $6y - 6 = 30$
- $6y = 36$
- $y = 6$

So the son is 6 years old.

Now, let's translate this to Lean 4:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

```

We're starting by importing the necessary libraries and setting up the basic framework.

Now, let's define the theorem:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_125 (x y : ℕ) (h₀ : 0 < x ∧ 0 < y) (h₁ : 5 * x = y)
    (h₂ : ↑x - (3 : ℤ) + (y - (3 : ℤ)) = 30) : x = 6 := by
```

We have defined the theorem with:
- `x` and `y` as natural numbers representing the ages
- `h₀`: Both are positive
- `h₁`: 5 * x = y (father's age is 5 times son's age)
- `h₂`: The equation for the sum of ages three years ago

Now we need to prove that `x = 6`.

First, let's convert h₂ to a more useful form:

```tactics
omega
```

The Lean tactic `omega` is powerful for solving arithmetic goals. It will:
1. Interpret the equation `↑x - (3 : ℤ) + (y - (3 : ℤ)) = 30`
2. Convert it to `x + y - 6 = 30` (since `↑x` converts x to an integer, and we're working with integer arithmetic)
3. So `x + y = 36`
4. With `h₁: 5 * x = y`, it can substitute `y = 5 * x` into `x + y = 36`
5. This becomes `x + 5 * x = 36`
6. So `6 * x = 36`
7. Therefore `x = 6`

The `omega` tactic is able to solve this system of equations automatically, proving that `x = 6`.

The key insight was that we had two equations:
1. `y = 5 * x` (from h₁)
2. `x + y = 36` (from h₂, converted to integer arithmetic)

Substituting the first into the second gives us `x + 5 * x = 36`, which simplifies to `6 * x = 36`, so `x = 6`.

The Lean proof leverages the power of `omega` to solve these arithmetic constraints directly.
