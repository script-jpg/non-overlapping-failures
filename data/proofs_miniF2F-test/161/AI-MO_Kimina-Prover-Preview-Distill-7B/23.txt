-- This is a classical algebra problem. Let's solve it in Lean 4.

  -- First, we analyze the problem and define our variables and equations.
  -- Let x be the father's current age and y be the son's current age.
  -- According to the problem, we have two conditions:
  -- 1. The father's age is five times the son's age: x = 5y
  -- 2. Three years ago, their ages summed to 30: (x-3) + (y-3) = 30

  -- We need to translate these into Lean 4 code. We'll start with the imports:

  import Mathlib
  import Aesop

  set_option maxHeartbeats 0

  open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat

  -- Now let's define the theorem statement. We need to represent our variables and conditions:

  theorem mathd_algebra_125 (x y : ℕ) (h₀ : 0 < x ∧ 0 < y) (h₁ : 5 * x = y)
      (h₂ : ↑x - (3 : ℤ) + (y - (3 : ℤ)) = 30) : x = 6 := by

  -- We have our theorem statement with:
  -- - x: father's current age (ℕ)
  -- - y: son's current age (ℕ)
  -- - h₀: both ages are positive
  -- - h₁: 5 * x = y (father's age is five times son's age)
  -- - h₂: (x - 3) + (y - 3) = 30 (sum of ages three years ago)

  -- Let's solve the second equation: (x-3) + (y-3) = 30
  -- This simplifies to x + y - 6 = 30, or x + y = 36

  have h3 : x + y = 36 := by
    have : (x : ℤ) + (y : ℤ) = 36 := by
      calc
        (x : ℤ) + (y : ℤ) = (↑x - (3 : ℤ) + (y - (3 : ℤ))) + 6 := by ring
        _ = 30 + 6 := by rw [h₂]
        _ = 36 := by norm_num
    exact_mod_cast this

  -- Now we have two equations:
  -- 1. 5 * x = y
  -- 2. x + y = 36

  -- We can substitute the first into the second. Since y = 5x, we have x + 5x = 36
  -- This simplifies to 6x = 36, so x = 6

  have : y = 5 * x := by linarith

  rw [this] at h3

  -- Now we have x + 5x = 36, which is 6x = 36, so x = 6
  have : 6 * x = 36 := by linarith

  -- Since 6x = 36, x = 6
  have : x = 6 := by omega

  -- And that's our answer: the son is 6 years old today.
