-- This is a fun problem about finding the ages of a father and son.
  -- The problem states that today the father's age is five times the son's age, and three years ago their ages summed to 30.
  -- We need to find the son's current age.

  -- Let's start by thinking about the problem algebraically. If we call the father's current age x and the son's y, then:
  -- 1. x = 5y (today the father's age is five times the son's)
  -- 2. x - 3 + y - 3 = 30 (three years ago their ages summed to 30)

  -- Simplifying the second equation: x + y - 6 = 30, so x + y = 36

  -- Substituting the first equation (x = 5y) into the simplified second equation:
  -- 5y + y = 36
  -- 6y = 36
  -- y = 6

  -- So the son is 6 years old. Let's verify:
  -- If y = 6, then x = 5y = 30
  -- Three years ago: x - 3 = 27, y - 3 = 3, and 27 + 3 = 30 ✓

  -- Now, let's translate this to Lean 2:

  -- Define the theorem statement. We have two natural numbers x and y representing the ages, with the assumptions:
  -- h₀: Both ages are positive
  -- h₁: The father's age is five times the son's (x = 5y)
  -- h₂: Three years ago their ages summed to 30 (x - 3 + y - 3 = 30)

      (h₂ : ↑x - (3 : ℤ) + (y - (3 : ℤ)) = 30) : x = 6 := by

    -- From h₁ we have the equation 5x = y, which means y = 5x
    have eq1 : y = 5 * x := by omega

    -- From h₂: x - 3 + y - 3 = 30. Let's rewrite this equation.
    -- Converting to Lean's integer arithmetic to handle the subtraction properly:
    have eq2 : (↑x : ℤ) - 3 + (y - 3) = 30 := by

    -- Now, let's substitute y = 5x from eq1 into eq2:
    rw [eq1] at eq2

    -- This gives us: x - 3 + 5x - 3 = 30
    -- Simplifying: 6x - 6 = 30
    -- So 6x = 36
    -- Therefore x = 6
