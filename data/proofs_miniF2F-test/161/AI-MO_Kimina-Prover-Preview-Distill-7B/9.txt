-- This is a trivial but tedious algebra problem.
  -- A father's age is five times his son's age today.
  -- Exactly three years ago, the sum of their ages was 30.
  -- How old is the son today?
  -- Show that it is 6.

  -- Check that x = 6 ∧ y = 30 is a solution.
  have solution : x = 6 ∧ y = 30 := by
    norm_cast at h₂
    omega

  -- Prove that the solution is unique.
  have unique : x = 6 := by
    obtain ⟨hx, hy⟩ := solution
    have h : x = 6 := by
      linarith
    exact h

  exact unique
