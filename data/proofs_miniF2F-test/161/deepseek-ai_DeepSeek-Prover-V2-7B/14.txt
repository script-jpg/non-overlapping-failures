theorem mathd_algebra_125_2 : ∃ x y : ℕ, 0 < x ∧ 0 < y ∧ 5 * x = y ∧ (x - 3) + (y - 3) = 30 := by
  /-
  We need to find natural numbers \( x \) and \( y \) such that:
  1. \( 0 < x \)
  2. \( 0 < y \)
  3. \( 5x = y \)
  4. \( (x - 3) + (y - 3) = 30 \)
  
  Given \( 5x = y \), we substitute \( y \) in the fourth equation:
  \[ (x - 3) + (5x - 3) = 30 \]
  Simplifying, we get:
  \[ 6x - 6 = 30 \]
  \[ 6x = 36 \]
  \[ x = 6 \]
  Then, substituting back to find \( y \):
  \[ y = 5 \times 6 = 30 \]
  
  Thus, the solution is \( x = 6 \) and \( y = 30 \).
