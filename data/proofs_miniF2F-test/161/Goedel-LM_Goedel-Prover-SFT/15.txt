  Given the conditions:
  1. The father's age \( F \) is five times the son's age \( S \).
  2. Three years ago, the sum of their ages was 30.
  We need to determine the son's age \( x \) today.
  From the first condition, we have:
  \[ F = 5S \]
  From the second condition, we have:
  \[ (x - 3) + (5x - 3) = 30 \]
  Simplifying the second equation:
  \[ x - 3 + 5x - 3 = 30 \]
  \[ 6x - 6 = 30 \]
  \[ 6x = 36 \]
  \[ x = 6 \]
  Thus, the son's age today is \( 6 \).

    -- Convert the equation to natural numbers for easier manipulation.
    zify at h₂
    -- Solve the equation using linear arithmetic.
