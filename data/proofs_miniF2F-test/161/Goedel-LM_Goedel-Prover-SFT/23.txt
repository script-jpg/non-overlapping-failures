  Given that the father's age is five times the son's age, and three years ago, the sum of their ages was 30, we need to determine the son's current age. We start by expressing the ages in terms of a single variable \( x \).
  1. The father's current age is \( 5x \).
  2. Three years ago, the son's age was \( x - 3 \) and the father's age was \( 5x - 3 \).
  3. According to the problem, the sum of their ages three years ago was 30:
     \[
     (x - 3) + (5x - 3) = 30
     \]
  4. Simplifying this equation:
     \[
     x - 3 + 5x - 3 = 30 \implies 6x - 6 = 30 \implies 6x = 36 \implies x = 6
     \]
  Thus, the son's current age is \( x = 6 \).
