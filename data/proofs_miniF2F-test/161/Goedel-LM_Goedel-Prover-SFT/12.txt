  Given that the father's age \( y \) is five times the son's age \( x \), and three years ago, the sum of their ages was 30, we need to determine the son's current age. The equations derived from the problem are:
  1. \( y = 5x \)
  2. \( (x - 3) + (y - 3) = 30 \)
  First, we simplify the second equation:
  \[ x - 3 + y - 3 = 30 \]
  \[ x + y - 6 = 30 \]
  \[ x + y = 36 \]
  Next, we substitute \( y = 5x \) into the equation \( x + y = 36 \):
  \[ x + 5x = 36 \]
  \[ 6x = 36 \]
  \[ x = 6 \]
  Thus, the son's current age is \( 6 \).
