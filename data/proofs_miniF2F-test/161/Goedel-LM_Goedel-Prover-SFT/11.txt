  Given that the father's age today is five times the son's age, and exactly three years ago, the sum of their ages was 30, we need to determine the son's current age. Let \( x \) be the son's current age and \( y \) be the father's current age. We are given the equations:
  \[ 5x = y \]
  \[ x - 3 + y - 3 = 30 \]
  First, substitute \( y = 5x \) into the second equation:
  \[ x - 3 + 5x - 3 = 30 \]
  Simplify the equation:
  \[ 6x - 6 = 30 \]
  Add 6 to both sides:
  \[ 6x = 36 \]
  Divide by 6:
  \[ x = 6 \]
  Thus, the son's current age is \( 6 \).
