  Given that today a father's age is five times his son's age, and exactly three years ago, the sum of their ages was 30, we need to determine the son's current age. Let \( x \) be the son's current age and \( y \) be the father's current age. We are given the following conditions:
  1. \( 5x = y \)
  2. \( x - 3 + (y - 3) = 30 \)
  First, substitute \( y = 5x \) into the second equation:
  \[ x - 3 + (5x - 3) = 30 \]
  Simplify the equation:
  \[ x - 3 + 5x - 3 = 30 \]
  \[ 6x - 6 = 30 \]
  Add 6 to both sides to isolate the term involving \( x \):
  \[ 6x = 36 \]
  Divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( x \):
  \[ x = 6 \]
  Thus, the son's current age is \( 6 \).
