  Given that the father's age today is five times his son's age, and exactly three years ago, the sum of their ages was 30, we need to determine the son's age today. We are provided with the following conditions:
  - \( y = 5x \)
  - \( x - 3 + y - 3 = 30 \)
  First, we simplify the second equation:
  \[ x - 3 + 5x - 3 = 30 \]
  \[ 6x - 6 = 30 \]
  Next, we solve for \( x \):
  \[ 6x = 36 \]
  \[ x = 6 \]
  Thus, the son's age today is \( 6 \).
