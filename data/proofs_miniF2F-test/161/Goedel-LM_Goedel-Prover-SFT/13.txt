  Given that the father's age today is five times the son's age, and exactly three years ago, the sum of their ages was 30, we need to determine the son's current age. Let \( x \) be the son's current age and \( y \) be the father's current age. We are given the following equations:
  1. \( y = 5x \)
  2. \( x - 3 + (y - 3) = 30 \)
  First, substitute \( y = 5x \) into the second equation:
  \[ x - 3 + (5x - 3) = 30 \]
  Simplify the equation:
  \[ x - 3 + 5x - 3 = 30 \]
  \[ 6x - 6 = 30 \]
  Add 6 to both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
  \[ 6x = 36 \]
  Divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( x \):
  \[ x = 6 \]
  Thus, the son's current age is \( 6 \).

    simp at h₃
    -- Simplify the equation to isolate x.
    have h₄ := congr_arg (Int.ofNat) h₂
    simp at h₄
    -- Solve the equation using the omega tactic which is designed for linear integer arithmetic.
