  Given that the father's age is five times the son's age, and exactly three years ago, the sum of their ages was 30, we need to determine the son's current age. We start by setting up the equations based on the given conditions.
  1. Let \( x \) be the son's current age and \( y \) be the father's current age.
  2. We know that \( y = 5x \) from the problem statement.
  3. We also know that the sum of their ages three years ago was 30, which gives us the equation \( x - 3 + y - 3 = 30 \).
  Substituting \( y = 5x \) into the second equation, we get:
  \[ x - 3 + 5x - 3 = 30 \]
  \[ 6x - 6 = 30 \]
  \[ 6x = 36 \]
  \[ x = 6 \]
  Thus, the son's current age is \( x = 6 \).
