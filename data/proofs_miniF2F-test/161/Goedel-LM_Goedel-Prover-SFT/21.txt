  Given that today a father's age is five times his son's age, and exactly three years ago, the sum of their ages was 30, we need to determine the son's age today. Let \( x \) be the son's age and \( y \) be the father's age. We are given the following conditions:
  1. \( 5x = y \)
  2. \( (x - 3) + (y - 3) = 30 \)
  First, substitute \( y \) from the first equation into the second equation:
  \[ (x - 3) + (5x - 3) = 30 \]
  Simplify the equation:
  \[ x - 3 + 5x - 3 = 30 \]
  \[ 6x - 6 = 30 \]
  Add 6 to both sides:
  \[ 6x = 36 \]
  Divide by 6:
  \[ x = 6 \]
  Thus, the son's age today is \( 6 \).

  -- Substitute y = 5x into the second equation
  have h₂' : 5 * x = y := by
