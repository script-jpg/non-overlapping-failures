  Given that today a father's age is five times his son's age, and exactly three years ago, the sum of their ages was 30, we need to determine the son's current age. We start by setting up the equations based on the given conditions.
  1. Let \( x \) be the son's current age and \( y \) be the father's current age. We have the equation \( 5x = y \).
  2. Three years ago, the son's age was \( x - 3 \) and the father's age was \( y - 3 \). The sum of their ages three years ago was given to be 30, so we have the equation \( (x - 3) + (y - 3) = 30 \).
  We substitute \( y = 5x \) into the second equation:
  \[ (x - 3) + (5x - 3) = 30 \]
  Simplifying this equation:
  \[ x - 3 + 5x - 3 = 30 \]
  \[ 6x - 6 = 30 \]
  Adding 6 to both sides:
  \[ 6x = 36 \]
  Dividing by 6:
  \[ x = 6 \]
  Thus, the son's current age is \( x = 6 \).

  -- We use the given equations to solve for x.
  -- Substituting y = 5x into the second equation:
  -- (x - 3) + (5x - 3) = 30
  -- Simplifying this equation:
  -- x - 3 + 5x - 3 = 30
  -- 6x - 6 = 30
  -- Adding 6 to both sides:
  -- 6x = 36
  -- Dividing by 6:
  -- x = 6
  have h₄ : (x : ℤ) = 6 := by

  -- Finally, we cast the result back to natural number.
