  Given that the father's age is five times the son's age, and exactly three years ago, the sum of their ages was 30, we need to determine the son's current age. Let \( x \) be the son's current age and \( y \) be the father's current age. We are given the following conditions:
  1. \( y = 5x \)
  2. \( x - 3 + (y - 3) = 30 \)
  First, we simplify the second equation:
  \[ x - 3 + y - 3 = 30 \]
  \[ x + y - 6 = 30 \]
  \[ x + y = 36 \]
  Next, we substitute \( y = 5x \) into the equation \( x + y = 36 \):
  \[ x + 5x = 36 \]
  \[ 6x = 36 \]
  \[ x = 6 \]
  Thus, the son's current age is \( x = 6 \).
