  To find the units digit \( n \) of the four-digit number \( 374n \) and show that it is 4, we start by expressing the number in a form that allows us to use the properties of divisibility by 18. We know that \( 374n \) must be divisible by 18. By breaking down the problem into smaller steps, we can determine the value of \( n \).
  1. **Express the number in terms of \( n \)**: The number \( 374n \) can be written as \( 374 \times 10 + n \).
  2. **Use divisibility by 18**: Since \( 374 \times 10 + n \) is divisible by 18, we can use this property to find \( n \).
  3. **Simplify the divisibility condition**: We simplify the divisibility condition to \( 374 \times 10 + n \equiv 0 \pmod{18} \).
  4. **Solve for \( n \)**: By solving the congruence, we find that \( n \equiv 4 \pmod{18} \).
  5. **Check the range of \( n \)**: Given that \( n \) is a single digit (0 to 9), the only solution is \( n = 4 \).
