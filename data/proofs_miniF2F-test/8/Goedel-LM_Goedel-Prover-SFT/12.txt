  To determine the units digit \( n \) of the four-digit number \(\underline{374n}\) that is divisible by 18, we need to show that \( n \) is 4. The given number can be expressed as \( 3740 + n \). For the number to be divisible by 18, the sum of its digits must be divisible by 18. The sum of the digits of \( 3740 + n \) is \( 3 + 7 + 4 + 0 + n = 14 + n \). For \( 14 + n \) to be divisible by 18, \( n \) must be 4, as \( 14 + 4 = 18 \).

  -- Since 18 = 2 * 3^2, we need the number to be divisible by both 2 and 3^2.
  -- This means the number must be even and the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9.
  -- The sum of the digits of 3740 + n is 14 + n.
  -- For 14 + n to be divisible by 18, n must be 4.

  -- Rewrite the divisibility condition using the modulus operation.
  -- This step is equivalent to the original condition but more explicit about the modulus.

  -- Simplify the numerical expression to confirm the condition.
  -- Now we need to check that 3740 + n is divisible by 18.
