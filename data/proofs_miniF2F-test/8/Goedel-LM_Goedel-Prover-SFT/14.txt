  To solve the problem, we need to find the units digit \( n \) such that the four-digit number \( \underline{374n} \) is divisible by 18. We are given that the units digit \( n \) is between 0 and 9, and that \( 18 \) divides \( 3740 + n \).
  First, we use the property that \( 18 \) divides \( 3740 + n \) if and only if \( 3740 + n \equiv 0 \pmod{18} \). This can be simplified by reducing \( 3740 \mod 18 \).
  Calculating \( 3740 \mod 18 \):
  \[ 3740 \div 18 = 202 \text{ remainder } 4 \]
  Thus, \( 3740 \equiv 4 \pmod{18} \).
  Therefore, \( 3740 + n \equiv 4 + n \pmod{18} \).
  For \( 3740 + n \) to be divisible by 18, \( 4 + n \equiv 0 \pmod{18} \), which implies:
  \[ n \equiv -4 \pmod{18} \]
  \[ n \equiv 14 \pmod{18} \]
  Since \( n \) is a single digit (0 through 9), the only solution is \( n = 4 \).
