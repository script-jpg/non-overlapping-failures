  To find the units digit \( n \) of the four-digit number \(\underline{374n}\) such that the number is divisible by 18, we need to check the divisibility condition. The number \(\underline{374n}\) can be expressed as \( 374n \). Since \( 374n \) is divisible by 18, we need to find \( n \) that satisfies this condition.
  First, we express the divisibility condition using the modulus operation:
  \[ 374n \equiv 0 \pmod{18} \]
  Next, we simplify the expression \( 374n \mod 18 \):
  \[ 374 \equiv 14 \pmod{18} \]
  Thus, the congruence becomes:
  \[ 14n \equiv 0 \pmod{18} \]
  To solve for \( n \), we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 14 modulo 18. The inverse of 14 modulo 18 is 14, because:
  \[ 14 \times 14 \equiv 1 \pmod{18} \]
  Therefore, we multiply both sides of the congruence \( 14n \equiv 0 \pmod{18} \) by 14:
  \[ n \equiv 0 \pmod{18} \]
  This implies that \( n \) must be a multiple of 18. Since \( n \) is a single digit (0 to 9), the only possible value for \( n \) that satisfies this condition is \( n = 4 \).
