  To determine the units digit \( n \) of the four-digit number \( 374n \) such that it is divisible by 18, we need to check the conditions under which the number is divisible by 18. A number is divisible by 18 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 9.
  1. **Divisibility by 2**: Since the last digit of the number \( 374n \) is \( n \), the number is divisible by 2 if \( n \) is even.
  2. **Divisibility by 9**: The sum of the digits of the number \( 374n \) is \( 3 + 7 + 4 + n = 14 + n \). Therefore, the number is divisible by 9 if \( 14 + n \) is divisible by 9.
  Given that \( n \) is a single digit (0 through 9), we can solve for \( n \) to find that \( n = 4 \) satisfies both conditions.
