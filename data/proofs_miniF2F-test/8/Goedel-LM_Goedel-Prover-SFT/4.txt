  To solve the problem, we need to determine the units digit \( n \) of the number \( 374n \) such that it is divisible by 18. The number \( 374n \) can be expressed as \( 3740 + n \). We need to find \( n \) such that \( 3740 + n \) is divisible by 18.
  First, we calculate the remainder of 3740 when divided by 18:
  \[ 3740 \div 18 = 202 \text{ remainder } 4 \]
  Thus,
  \[ 3740 \equiv 4 \pmod{18} \]
  Therefore, we need:
  \[ 3740 + n \equiv 0 \pmod{18} \]
  which simplifies to:
  \[ 4 + n \equiv 0 \pmod{18} \]
  Solving for \( n \):
  \[ n \equiv -4 \pmod{18} \]
  \[ n \equiv 14 \pmod{18} \]
  Since \( n \) is a single-digit number (0 to 9), the only solution is \( n = 4 \).
