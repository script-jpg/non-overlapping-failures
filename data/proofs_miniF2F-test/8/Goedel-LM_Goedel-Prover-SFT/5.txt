  To solve the problem, we need to determine the units digit \( n \) of the four-digit number \( 374n \) such that the number is divisible by 18. The number \( 374n \) can be expressed as \( 3740 + n \). Given that \( 3740 \) is already divisible by 18, we only need to consider the divisibility of \( n \) by 18.
  First, we calculate the remainder of \( 3740 \) when divided by 18:
  \[ 3740 \div 18 = 202 \text{ remainder } 4 \]
  Thus, \( 3740 \equiv 4 \pmod{18} \).
  Next, we need \( 3740 + n \equiv 0 \pmod{18} \). This implies:
  \[ 4 + n \equiv 0 \pmod{18} \]
  \[ n \equiv -4 \pmod{18} \]
  \[ n \equiv 14 \pmod{18} \]
  Since \( n \) is a single digit (0 through 9), the only solution is \( n = 4 \).
