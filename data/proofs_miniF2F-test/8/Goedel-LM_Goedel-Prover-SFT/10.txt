  To determine the units digit \( n \) of the four-digit number \( 374n \) such that it is divisible by 18, we need to show that \( n \) must be 4. The divisibility rule for 18 states that a number is divisible by 18 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 9. Since 374n is divisible by 18, it must satisfy the divisibility conditions for both 2 and 9.
  1. **Divisibility by 2**: The units digit of 374n is n. For 374n to be divisible by 2, n must be even. The even digits between 0 and 9 are 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8.
  2. **Divisibility by 9**: The sum of the digits of 374n is \( 3 + 7 + 4 + n = 14 + n \). For 374n to be divisible by 9, \( 14 + n \) must be divisible by 9. We check each possible even value of n:
     - If \( n = 0 \), \( 14 + 0 = 14 \) (not divisible by 9)
     - If \( n = 2 \), \( 14 + 2 = 16 \) (not divisible by 9)
     - If \( n = 4 \), \( 14 + 4 = 18 \) (divisible by 9)
     - If \( n = 6 \), \( 14 + 6 = 20 \) (not divisible by 9)
     - If \( n = 8 \), \( 14 + 8 = 22 \) (not divisible by 9)
  Thus, the only value of n that satisfies both conditions is 4.
