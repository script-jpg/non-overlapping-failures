  To find the units digit \( n \) of the four-digit number \( 374n \) such that it is divisible by 18, we need to determine the value of \( n \) that satisfies the divisibility condition. The number \( 374n \) can be expressed as \( 3740 + n \). We need to find \( n \) such that \( 3740 + n \) is divisible by 18.
  First, we calculate the remainder of \( 3740 \) when divided by 18:
  \[ 3740 \div 18 = 202 \text{ remainder } 8 \]
  Thus, \( 3740 \equiv 8 \pmod{18} \).
  Next, we need to find \( n \) such that \( 8 + n \equiv 0 \pmod{18} \). This simplifies to:
  \[ n \equiv -8 \pmod{18} \]
  Since \( -8 \equiv 10 \pmod{18} \), we need \( n \equiv 10 \pmod{18} \).
  Given that \( n \) is a single digit (0 through 9), the only value that satisfies this condition is \( n = 4 \).

  -- We need to find the value of n such that 3740 + n is divisible by 18.
  have : n = 4 := by
    -- We use the fact that 18 divides 3740 + n to find n.
    have : 18 ∣ 3740 + n := h₁
    -- We use the property of divisibility to rewrite the equation.
