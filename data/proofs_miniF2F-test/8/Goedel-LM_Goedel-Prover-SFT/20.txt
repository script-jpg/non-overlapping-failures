  To solve the problem, we need to determine the units digit \( n \) of the four-digit number \( 374n \) such that it is divisible by 18. We will show that the only possible value for \( n \) is 4.
  1. **Divisibility Rule Application**:
     - A number is divisible by 18 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 9.
     - Since \( 374n \) is even, it is divisible by 2.
     - We need to check if \( 374n \) is divisible by 9.
  2. **Divisibility by 9**:
     - The sum of the digits of \( 374n \) is \( 3 + 7 + 4 + n = 14 + n \).
     - For \( 374n \) to be divisible by 9, \( 14 + n \) must be divisible by 9.
     - We solve \( 14 + n \equiv 0 \pmod{9} \):
       \[
       14 + n \equiv 0 \pmod{9} \implies n \equiv -14 \pmod{9} \implies n \equiv 4 \pmod{9}
       \]
     - Since \( n \) is a single digit (0 through 9), the only solution is \( n = 4 \).
  3. **Verification**:
     - Substitute \( n = 4 \) into the number: \( 3744 \).
     - Check divisibility by 18:
       \[
       3744 \div 18 = 208 \quad \text{(exact division)}
       \]
     - Thus, \( 3744 \) is divisible by 18, confirming that \( n = 4 \) is the correct solution.

  -- We need to show that n % 18 = 0, which is equivalent to n % 9 = 0
  have : n % 18 = 0 := by omega
  -- Solve the modular equation n % 9 = 0
  have : n % 9 = 0 := by omega
  -- Since n is a single digit, the only solution is n = 4
