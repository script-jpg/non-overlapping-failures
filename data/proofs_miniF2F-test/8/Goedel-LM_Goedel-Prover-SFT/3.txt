  To determine the units digit \( n \) in the four-digit number \( \underline{374n} \) such that it is divisible by 18, we need to find \( n \) that satisfies the given conditions. The number \( \underline{374n} \) can be expressed as \( 374 \times 10 + n \). We are given that \( 18 \) divides \( 374 \times 10 + n \).
  First, we simplify the divisibility condition:
  \[ 18 \mid 374 \times 10 + n \]
  This implies:
  \[ 374 \times 10 + n \equiv 0 \pmod{18} \]
  Next, we compute the remainder of \( 374 \times 10 \) when divided by 18:
  \[ 374 \div 18 = 20 \text{ remainder } 14 \]
  Thus:
  \[ 374 \times 10 = 3740 \equiv 14 \times 10 = 140 \equiv 140 \pmod{18} \]
  Since \( 140 \equiv 14 \pmod{18} \), we have:
  \[ 140 + n \equiv 0 \pmod{18} \]
  This simplifies to:
  \[ 14 + n \equiv 0 \pmod{18} \]
  Solving for \( n \):
  \[ n \equiv -14 \pmod{18} \]
  \[ n \equiv 4 \pmod{18} \]
  Given that \( n \) is a single digit (0-9), the only solution is:
  \[ n = 4 \]
