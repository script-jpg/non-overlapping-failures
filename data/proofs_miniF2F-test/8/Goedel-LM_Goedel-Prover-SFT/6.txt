  To find the units digit \( n \) of the four-digit number \(\underline{374n}\) such that it is divisible by 18, we need to ensure that the number formed by appending \( n \) to 374 is divisible by 18. This can be done by checking the divisibility condition directly.
  Given the number \(\underline{374n}\), we can express it as \( 374 \times 10 + n \). We need to find \( n \) such that \( 374 \times 10 + n \) is divisible by 18.
  First, we simplify the divisibility condition:
  \[ 374 \times 10 + n \equiv 0 \pmod{18} \]
  \[ 3740 + n \equiv 0 \pmod{18} \]
  Next, we compute the remainder of 3740 when divided by 18:
  \[ 3740 \div 18 = 202 \text{ remainder } 4 \]
  Thus,
  \[ 3740 \equiv 4 \pmod{18} \]
  Therefore, we need:
  \[ 4 + n \equiv 0 \pmod{18} \]
  \[ n \equiv -4 \pmod{18} \]
  \[ n \equiv 14 \pmod{18} \]
  Since \( n \) must be a single digit (0 through 9), the only solution is:
  \[ n = 4 \]
