  To determine the units digit \( n \) of the four-digit number \( \underline{374n} \) such that it is divisible by 18, we need to find \( n \) and show that it is 4.
  1. The number \( \underline{374n} \) can be expressed as \( 374 \times 10 + n \).
  2. Since \( \underline{374n} \) is divisible by 18, we have \( 18 \mid 374 \times 10 + n \).
  3. We need to find \( n \) such that \( 374 \times 10 + n \) is divisible by 18.
  4. Calculate the remainder of \( 374 \times 10 \) when divided by 18:
     \[
     374 \times 10 = 3740
     \]
     \[
     3740 \mod 18 = 14
     \]
  5. Therefore, \( 3740 + n \) must be divisible by 18:
     \[
     14 + n \equiv 0 \pmod{18}
     \]
  6. Solving for \( n \):
     \[
     n \equiv 18 - 14 \pmod{18}
     \]
     \[
     n \equiv 4 \pmod{18}
     \]
  7. Since \( n \) must be a single digit (0 through 9), the only solution is \( n = 4 \).

  -- Calculate the remainder of 374 * 10 when divided by 18.
  -- 374 * 10 = 3740, and 3740 % 18 = 14.
  -- Therefore, 3740 + n must be divisible by 18.
  -- This implies 14 + n % 18 = 0.
  -- Solving for n, we get n % 18 = 4.
  -- Since n is a single digit, the only solution is n = 4.
