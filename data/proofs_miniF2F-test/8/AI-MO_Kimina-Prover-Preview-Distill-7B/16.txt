-- The four-digit number $374n$ is divisible by 18. Find the units digit $n$. Show that it is 4.

  -- We need to find the digit $n$ such that $374n$ is divisible by 18.
  -- Since $374n$ is a four-digit number, $n$ must be between 0 and 9.
  have : n = 4 := by
    -- Check each possible digit 0-9 to see which makes $374n$ divisible by 18
