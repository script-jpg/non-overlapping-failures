-- The four-digit number is $374n$, where $n$ is the units digit.
  -- The number $374n$ is divisible by $18$.
  -- We need to find $n$.
  have : 374 * 10 + n = 3740 + n := by omega

  -- The number $3740$ is not divisible by $18$, but $3740 + n$ is divisible by $18$.
  -- Therefore, $n$ is divisible by $18$, where $0 \leq n \leq 9$.
  have : n = 4 := by
    omega

  -- Therefore, the units digit $n$ is $4$.
