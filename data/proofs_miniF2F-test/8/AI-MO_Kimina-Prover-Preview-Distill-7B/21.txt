-- The four-digit number is $374n$, where $n$ is the units digit.
  -- The number $374n$ is divisible by $18$.
  -- We need to find the value of $n$.

  rw [this] at h₁
  -- We know $3740 + n$ is divisible by $18$.
  -- So is $3740 + n = 18 * k$ for some $k$.
  rcases h₁ with ⟨k, h₁⟩
  -- We have $n = 18 * k - 3740$.
  have h₂ : n = 18 * k - 3740 := by omega
  -- Since $n$ is a digit, $0 ≤ n ≤ 9$.
  -- So $0 ≤ 18 * k - 3740 ≤ 9$.
  -- Thus $3740 ≤ 18 * k ≤ 3749$.
  -- We can find $k$ from this.
  have h₃ : k = 208 := by omega
  -- Substitute $k = 208$ into $n = 18 * k - 3740$.
  rw [h₃] at h₂
  -- So $n = 18 * 208 - 3740 = 4$.
