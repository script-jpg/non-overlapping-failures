-- We find the value of $n$ such that the four-digit number $374n$ is divisible by 18.
  -- A number is divisible by 18 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 9.
  have h₂: 2 ∣ 374 * 10 + n := by
    -- Clearly, $3740$ is even and $n$ is a digit, so $3740+n$ is even.

  have h₃: 9 ∣ 374 * 10 + n := by
    -- We know that a number is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.
    -- The sum of the digits of $374n$ is $3+7+4+n = 14 + n$, and $14+n$ is divisible by 9 if and only if $n = 4$.

  have h₄: 18 ∣ 374 * 10 + 4 := by
    norm_num
  -- Since $n \leq 9$, we conclude that $n = 4$.
