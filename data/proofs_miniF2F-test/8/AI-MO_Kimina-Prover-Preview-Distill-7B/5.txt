-- The four-digit number is $374n$, and we are told it is divisible by 18.
  -- We need to find the units digit $n$.
  have h₂ : n = 4 := by
    -- We know $n$ is a digit, so we can try all possible values (0 through 9).
    omega
  -- Because $n$ is a digit, we can use the `omega` tactic to solve this problem.
  exact h₂
