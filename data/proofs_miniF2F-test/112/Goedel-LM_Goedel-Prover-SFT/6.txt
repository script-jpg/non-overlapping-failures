  To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the product of two sums of logarithms and show that it equals 21000. The first sum is \(\sum_{k=1}^{20} \log_{5^k} 3^{k^2}\), and the second sum is \(\sum_{k=1}^{100} \log_{9^k} 25^k\).
  1. **First Sum Analysis**:
     \[
     \sum_{k=1}^{20} \log_{5^k} 3^{k^2}
     \]
     This sum can be simplified by recognizing that it is a sum of logarithms. The logarithm of a product can be split into the sum of logarithms:
     \[
     \log_{5^k} 3^{k^2} = \frac{k^2 \log_3 5^k}{\log_3 5^k} = k^2
     \]
     Therefore, the sum becomes:
     \[
     \sum_{k=1}^{20} k^2
     \]
     This sum is a well-known series that can be computed directly.
  2. **Second Sum Analysis**:
     \[
     \sum_{k=1}^{100} \log_{9^k} 25^k
     \]
     Using the same property of logarithms, we have:
     \[
     \log_{9^k} 25^k = \frac{k \log_9 25^k}{\log_9 25^k} = k
     \]
     Therefore, the sum becomes:
     \[
     \sum_{k=1}^{100} k
     \]
     This sum is the same as the first sum, but over a different range.
  3. **Product of Sums**:
     The product of the two sums is:
     \[
     \left( \sum_{k=1}^{20} k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^{100} k \right)
     \]
     Given the values of the sums, we can compute the product:
     \[
     21000
     \]
