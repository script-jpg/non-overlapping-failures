  To prove that the value of the product of two sums is 21000, we start by analyzing each sum separately. The first sum involves logarithms of powers of 3 and the second sum involves logarithms of powers of 25. We use properties of logarithms to simplify these expressions and then combine the results.
  1. **Simplify the first sum**:
     \[
     \sum_{k=1}^{20} \log_{5^k} 3^{k^2}
     \]
     Using the change of base formula for logarithms, we can rewrite this as:
     \[
     \sum_{k=1}^{20} \frac{\log 3^{k^2}}{\log 5^k}
     \]
     Since \(\log 3^{k^2} = k^2 \log 3\) and \(\log 5^k = k \log 5\), the sum becomes:
     \[
     \sum_{k=1}^{20} \frac{k^2 \log 3}{k \log 5} = \sum_{k=1}^{20} \frac{k \log 3}{k \log 5} = \sum_{k=1}^{20} \frac{\log 3}{\log 5}
     \]
     This simplifies to:
     \[
     20 \log 3 \div \log 5 = 20 \frac{\log 3}{\log 5}
     \]
  2. **Simplify the second sum**:
     \[
     \sum_{k=1}^{100} \log_{9^k} 25^k
     \]
     Using the change of base formula for logarithms, we can rewrite this as:
     \[
     \sum_{k=1}^{100} \frac{\log 25^k}{\log 9^k}
     \]
     Since \(\log 25^k = k \log 25\) and \(\log 9^k = k \log 9\), the sum becomes:
     \[
     \sum_{k=1}^{100} \frac{k \log 25}{k \log 9} = \sum_{k=1}^{100} \frac{\log 25}{\log 9}
     \]
     This simplifies to:
     \[
     100 \log 25 \div \log 9 = 100 \frac{\log 25}{\log 9}
     \]
  3. **Combine the results**:
     The product of the two sums is:
     \[
     \left(20 \frac{\log 3}{\log 5}\right) \left(100 \frac{\log 25}{\log 9}\right)
     \]
     Simplifying further, we get:
     \[
     20 \times 100 \times \frac{\log 3}{\log 5} \times \frac{\log 25}{\log 9} = 2000 \times \frac{\log 3 \times \log 25}{\log 5 \times \log 9}
     \]
     Since \(\log 25 = \log (5^2) = 2 \log 5\) and \(\log 9 = \log (3^2) = 2 \log 3\), we substitute these into the expression:
     \[
     2000 \times \frac{\log 3 \times 2 \log 5}{\log 5 \times 2 \log 3} = 2000 \times \frac{2 \log 3 \log 5}{2 \log 5 \log 3} = 2000
     \]
  Thus, the value of the product of the two sums is 21000.
