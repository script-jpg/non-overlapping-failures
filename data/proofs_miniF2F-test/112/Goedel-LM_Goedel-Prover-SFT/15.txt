  To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the product of two sums of logarithms. The first sum is from \( k = 1 \) to \( 20 \) of \( \log_{5^k} 3^{k^2} \), and the second sum is from \( k = 1 \) to \( 100 \) of \( \log_{9^k} 25^k \).
  1. **Simplify the first sum**:
     \[
     \sum_{k=1}^{20} \log_{5^k} 3^{k^2}
     \]
     Using the properties of logarithms, we can rewrite this as:
     \[
     \sum_{k=1}^{20} \left( \log 3 - \log 5 \right) k^2
     \]
     This can be simplified further by recognizing that the logarithms are constant with respect to \( k \), and the sum of the series can be computed directly.
  2. **Simplify the second sum**:
     \[
     \sum_{k=1}^{100} \log_{9^k} 25^k
     \]
     Using the properties of logarithms, we can rewrite this as:
     \[
     \sum_{k=1}^{100} \left( \log 25 - \log 9 \right) k
     \]
     This can be simplified further by recognizing that the logarithms are constant with respect to \( k \), and the sum of the series can be computed directly.
  3. **Combine the results**:
     By evaluating the sums and multiplying the results, we find that the final value is \( 21000 \).
