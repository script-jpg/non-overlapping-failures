  -- The previous code is trying to prove the goal by contradiction, assuming that p * q - (p + q) = 194 for some primes p, q in the given range. It derives a contradiction by showing that there are no such p and q satisfying this equation.

  -- The problem asks which number could be obtained from subtracting the sum of two different primes between 4 and 18 from their product. We need to show that 194 is not one of these numbers.

  -- The approach is to assume that there exist two primes p, q in the given range such that p * q - (p + q) = 194. We then try to find these primes by case analysis on p and q.

  -- The key insight is that if we rearrange the equation p * q - (p + q) = 194, we get p * q - p - q = 194, which can be rewritten as (p - 1) * (q - 1) = 195. This is a useful transformation because it converts the problem from looking for two primes to looking for two numbers (p-1) and (q-1) whose product is 195.

  -- We then analyze the factors of 195 to determine if there are any pairs of factors that could correspond to p and q. Since 195 = 3 * 5 * 13, we look for factor pairs of 195 where both factors are between 2 and 17 (since p and q must be between 4 and 18).

  -- After checking all possible factor pairs of 195, we find that none of them could correspond to primes p and q in the given range. Therefore, no such primes exist, and 194 is not a possible value.

  -- The Lean proof formalizes this reasoning by using case analysis on all possible values of p and q in the range, showing that none of them satisfy the equation p * q - (p + q) = 194.

  -- The Lean proof is more comprehensive than the original problem's solution because it checks all possible values in the range, ensuring that 194 is indeed not achievable.
