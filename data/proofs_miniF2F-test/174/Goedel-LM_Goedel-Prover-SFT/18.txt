  To solve the problem, we need to verify that the expression \( p \cdot q - (p + q) \) for two distinct prime numbers \( p \) and \( q \) between 4 and 18 does not equal 194. We will check each possible pair of primes within the specified range and show that the expression does not yield 194.

  have h₃ : p ≤ 18 := by linarith
  have h₄ : q ≤ 18 := by linarith
  interval_cases p <;> interval_cases q <;> simp_all (config := {decide := true})
  -- By checking all pairs of primes within the range, we find that none of them satisfy the expression equaling 194.
