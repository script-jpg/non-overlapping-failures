  Given two different prime numbers \( p \) and \( q \) both between 4 and 18, we need to show that the expression \( p \times q - (p + q) \) cannot be 194. We will consider all possible pairs of primes \( (p, q) \) that satisfy the given conditions and verify that the expression does not yield 194 for any pair.

  -- By checking all pairs of primes (p, q) where 4 ≤ p, p ≤ 18, 4 ≤ q, and q ≤ 18, we find that none of these pairs satisfy the expression p * q - (p + q) = 194.
