  We need to show that the expression \( p \cdot q - (p + q) \) for two different prime numbers \( p \) and \( q \) between 4 and 18 cannot equal 194. We will consider all possible pairs of prime numbers within the specified range and verify that the expression does not yield 194.

  -- We consider all possible pairs of prime numbers p and q within the range [4, 18]
  have h₃ : p ≤ 18 := by linarith
  have h₄ : q ≤ 18 := by linarith
  interval_cases p <;> interval_cases q <;> simp_all (config := {decide := true})
  -- For each pair (p, q), we compute p * q - (p + q) and check if it equals 194
  -- Since all pairs result in different values, 194 is not a possible result
