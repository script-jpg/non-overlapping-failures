  We need to show that for two different prime numbers \( p \) and \( q \) between 4 and 18, the expression \( pq - (p + q) \) does not equal 194. We will consider all pairs of primes \( p \) and \( q \) within the specified range and verify that the expression does not yield 194.

  -- We consider all possible pairs of primes p and q within the given range.
  have h : p * q - (p + q) ≠ 194 := by
    -- We know that the maximum value of p and q is 18.
    have h : p ≤ 18 := by linarith
    have h' : q ≤ 18 := by linarith
    -- We use interval_cases to consider all possible values of p and q.
    interval_cases p <;> interval_cases q <;> simp_all (config := {decide := true})
    -- For each pair (p, q), we check if the expression pq - (p + q) equals 194.
    -- By checking all pairs, we find that none of them satisfy the equation.
  -- Therefore, the expression pq - (p + q) does not equal 194.
