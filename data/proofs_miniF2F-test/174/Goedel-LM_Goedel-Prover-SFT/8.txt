  Given two different prime numbers \( p \) and \( q \) between 4 and 18, we need to show that the expression \( p \times q - (p + q) \) cannot equal 194. We will consider all possible pairs of primes \( p \) and \( q \) within the specified range and verify that the expression does not yield 194.

  -- We will consider all pairs of primes p and q within the range [4, 18]
  have h : p ≤ 18 := by linarith
  have h' : q ≤ 18 := by linarith
  interval_cases p <;> interval_cases q <;> simp_all (config := {decide := true})
  -- For each pair (p, q), we compute p * q - (p + q) and check if it equals 194
  -- By checking all pairs, we find that none of them yield 194, thus confirming the theorem
