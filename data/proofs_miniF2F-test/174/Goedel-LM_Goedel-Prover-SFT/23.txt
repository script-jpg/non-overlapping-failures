  To show that the product of two different prime numbers between 4 and 18, when subtracted from their sum, cannot be 22, 60, 119, 180, or 231, we proceed as follows:
  1. Assume the primes \( p \) and \( q \) are chosen such that \( 4 \leq p \leq 18 \) and \( 4 \leq q \leq 18 \).
  2. We need to verify that \( p \times q - (p + q) \) is not equal to any of the numbers 22, 60, 119, 180, or 231.
  3. We use the fact that both \( p \) and \( q \) are prime numbers and their values are bounded by 18.
  4. By examining the possible pairs of primes within the specified range, we can check that \( p \times q - (p + q) \) does not yield any of the given numbers.

  have h₄ := h₀.2.eq_two_or_odd
  -- We use interval_cases to check all possible values of p and q within the given range.
  interval_cases p <;> interval_cases q <;> simp_all (config := {decide := true})
