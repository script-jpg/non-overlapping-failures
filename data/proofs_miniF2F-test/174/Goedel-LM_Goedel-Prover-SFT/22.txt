  Given two different prime numbers \( p \) and \( q \) between 4 and 18, we need to show that the difference between their product and their sum is not 119. We will consider the possible values of \( p \) and \( q \) and verify that the expression \( p \cdot q - (p + q) \) does not equal 119.

  -- We start by assuming the contrary, i.e., that the difference is 119.
  intro h
  -- We consider the possible values of p and q within the given range.
  have : p ≤ 18 := by linarith
  have : q ≤ 18 := by linarith
  -- We use interval_cases to check each possible pair of p and q.
  interval_cases p <;> interval_cases q <;> simp_all (config := {decide := true})
