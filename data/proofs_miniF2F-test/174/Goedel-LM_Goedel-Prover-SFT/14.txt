  To solve the problem, we need to determine which number could be obtained by choosing two different prime numbers between 4 and 18 and then subtracting their sum from their product. We will show that the number 119 cannot be obtained under these conditions.
  1. **Identify the range of possible values for the primes:**
     - The primes \( p \) and \( q \) must be between 4 and 18.
  2. **List the possible values of \( p \) and \( q \):**
     - \( p \) and \( q \) can be 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, or 19.
  3. **Calculate the product and sum of \( p \) and \( q \):**
     - The product \( p \times q \) can be 5 \times 7 = 35, 5 \times 11 = 55, 5 \times 13 = 65, 5 \times 17 = 85, 5 \times 19 = 95,
      7 \times 11 = 77, 7 \times 13 = 91, 7 \times 17 = 119, 7 \times 19 = 133,
      11 \times 13 = 143, 11 \times 17 = 187, 11 \times 19 = 209,
      13 \times 17 = 221, 13 \times 19 = 247,
      17 \times 19 = 323.
     - The sum \( p + q \) can be 5 + 7 = 12, 5 + 11 = 16, 5 + 13 = 18, 5 + 17 = 22, 5 + 19 = 24,
       7 + 11 = 18, 7 + 13 = 20, 7 + 17 = 24, 7 + 19 = 26,
       11 + 13 = 24, 11 + 17 = 28, 11 + 19 = 30,
       13 + 17 = 30, 13 + 19 = 32,
       17 + 19 = 36.
  4. **Calculate \( p \times q - (p + q) \):**
     - For each pair \((p, q)\), compute \( p \times q - (p + q) \).
  5. **Check if any result equals 194:**
     - None of the calculated values match 194.
  Thus, the number 194 cannot be obtained by choosing two different prime numbers between 4 and 18 and then subtracting their sum from their product.
