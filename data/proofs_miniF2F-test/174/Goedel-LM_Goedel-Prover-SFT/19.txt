  Given two different prime numbers \( p \) and \( q \) between 4 and 18, we need to show that their product minus their sum cannot be 194. We start by considering the range of \( p \) and \( q \). Since \( p \) and \( q \) are prime numbers and their product minus their sum equals 194, we can use the properties of prime numbers and the range constraints to derive a contradiction. Specifically, we will use the fact that the product of two primes in the range 4 to 18 and their sum, if the result is 194, would imply that the primes are \( 2 \) and \( 2 \), which contradicts the primality of these numbers.
