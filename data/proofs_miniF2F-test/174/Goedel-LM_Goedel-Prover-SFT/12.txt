  To solve the problem, we need to show that for two distinct prime numbers \( p \) and \( q \) chosen from the set \(\{4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18\}\), the expression \( p \cdot q - (p + q) \) cannot equal 194.
  1. **Range Constraints**: Given \( 4 \leq p \leq 18 \) and \( 4 \leq q \leq 18 \), we need to check all pairs \((p, q)\) where \( p \) and \( q \) are distinct primes within this range.
  2. **Prime Check**: We need to ensure that \( p \) and \( q \) are indeed prime numbers within the specified range.
  3. **Expression Calculation**: For each pair \((p, q)\), we calculate \( p \cdot q - (p + q) \) and verify that it does not equal 194.
  4. **Verification**: By checking all pairs, we find that none of them satisfy the condition \( p \cdot q - (p + q) = 194 \).

  -- We need to show that the expression p * q - (p + q) does not equal 194 for any valid p and q.
  have h : p * ↑q - (↑p + ↑q) ≠ (194 : ℕ) := by
    -- Since p and q are primes and within the specified range, we can check all pairs (p, q).
    have h₃ : p ≤ 18 := by linarith
    have h₄ : q ≤ 18 := by linarith
    -- We use interval_cases to check all possible values of p and q.
    interval_cases p <;> interval_cases q <;> simp_all (config := {decide := true})
    -- For each pair (p, q), we check if the expression p * q - (p + q) equals 194.
    -- By checking all pairs, we find that none of them satisfy this condition.
  -- Therefore, the expression p * q - (p + q) cannot equal 194.
