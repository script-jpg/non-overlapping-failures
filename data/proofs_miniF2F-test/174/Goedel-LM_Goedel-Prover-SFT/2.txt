  To solve the problem, we need to verify that the expression \( p \cdot q - (p + q) \) for any two distinct prime numbers \( p \) and \( q \) chosen from the set \(\{4, 5, \ldots, 18\}\) does not equal 194. We will check all possible pairs of distinct primes within this range and show that none of the results match 194.

  -- We will check all pairs of distinct primes from the set {4, 5,..., 18}
  -- and show that none of the results match 194.
  have l₀ : p ≤ 18 := by linarith
  have l₁ : q ≤ 18 := by linarith
  -- We use interval_cases to check each pair of distinct primes.
  interval_cases p <;> interval_cases q <;> simp_all (config := {decide := true})
  -- By checking all pairs, we find that none of the results equal 194.
