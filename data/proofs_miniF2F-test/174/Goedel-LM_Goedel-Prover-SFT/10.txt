  We need to show that for two different prime numbers \( p \) and \( q \) each between 4 and 18, the expression \( p \times q - (p + q) \) does not equal 194. We will consider all possible pairs \((p, q)\) under the given constraints and verify that the expression does not yield 194.

  -- We will check all possible pairs (p, q) where p and q are primes and 4 ≤ p, q ≤ 18.
  -- For each pair, we will compute the expression p * q - (p + q) and check if it equals 194.
  -- By examining all pairs, we will find that none of them satisfy the equation, thus proving the theorem.
