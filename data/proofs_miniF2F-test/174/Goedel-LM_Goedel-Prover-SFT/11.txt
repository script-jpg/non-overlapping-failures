  Given two different prime numbers \( p \) and \( q \) between 4 and 18, we need to show that the difference between their product and their sum is not equal to any of the numbers 22, 60, 119, 180, or 231. We will use the properties of primes and the range constraints to derive the necessary result.

  -- We use the fact that p and q are primes and their values are between 4 and 18.
  have h₃ : p ≤ 18 := by linarith
  have h₄ : q ≤ 18 := by linarith
  -- We will use interval cases to check each possible value of p and q within the given range.
  interval_cases p <;> interval_cases q <;> simp_all (config := {decide := true})
  -- By checking all combinations of p and q, we will show that the expression p * q - (p + q) does not yield any of the given numbers.
