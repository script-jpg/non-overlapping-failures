  Given two different prime numbers \( p \) and \( q \) between 4 and 18, we need to show that the difference between their product and their sum is not equal to 194. We will consider all possible pairs \((p, q)\) where \( p \) and \( q \) are primes within the specified range and verify that the expression \( p \cdot q - (p + q) \) does not yield 194.

  -- Consider all possible pairs (p, q) where p and q are primes between 4 and 18.
  have : p ≤ 18 := by linarith
  have : q ≤ 18 := by linarith
  -- Use interval_cases to check all possible pairs (p, q) within the range.
  interval_cases p <;> interval_cases q <;> simp_all (config := {decide := true})
  -- Use linarith to conclude that none of the pairs yield 194.
