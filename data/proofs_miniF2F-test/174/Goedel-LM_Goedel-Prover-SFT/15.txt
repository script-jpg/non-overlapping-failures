  To prove that the difference between the product of two different prime numbers between 4 and 18 and their sum cannot be 194, we start by considering the range of possible primes within the given constraints. The primes between 4 and 18 are 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19. We then compute the product of any two of these primes and subtract their sum. By examining the possible combinations, we find that none of the results match 194. Therefore, the statement is true.
