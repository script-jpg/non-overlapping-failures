  To prove that the sum of two different prime numbers between 4 and 18, subtracted from their product, cannot be 194, we start by considering the range of possible primes within the given constraints. The primes in this range are 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19. We need to show that for any pair of these primes, the expression \( p \times q - (p + q) \) is not equal to 194.
  First, we note that the product of any two primes in this range is at least \( 5 \times 7 = 35 \). Additionally, the sum of any two primes in this range is at least \( 5 + 7 = 12 \). Therefore, the expression \( p \times q - (p + q) \) is at least \( 35 - 12 = 23 \), which is significantly larger than 194.
  To formalize this, we can use the fact that the smallest prime in the range is 5, and the largest is 19. For any pair of primes \( p \) and \( q \) in this range, the sum \( p + q \) is at least 10 (since \( 5 + 7 = 12 \)), and the product \( p \times q \) is at least 35. Thus, the expression \( p \times q - (p + q) \) is at least 23, which is much larger than 194.
