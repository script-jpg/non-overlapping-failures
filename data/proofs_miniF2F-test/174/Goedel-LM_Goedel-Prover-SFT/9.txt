  Given two different prime numbers \( p \) and \( q \) between 4 and 18, we need to show that the difference between their product and their sum is not equal to any of the numbers in the set \(\{22, 60, 119, 180, 231\}\). Specifically, we aim to prove that \( p \cdot q - (p + q) \neq 194 \).
  To prove this, we will consider the possible values of \( p \) and \( q \) that satisfy the given conditions. We will then compute the expression \( p \cdot q - (p + q) \) for each pair and verify that it is not equal to 194.
