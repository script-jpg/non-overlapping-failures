  Given two different prime numbers \( p \) and \( q \) such that \( 4 \leq p \leq 18 \) and \( 4 \leq q \leq 18 \), we need to show that the expression \( p \cdot q - (p + q) \) cannot be equal to 194.
  1. **Case Analysis on \( p \) and \( q \)**:
     - Since \( p \) and \( q \) are primes between 4 and 18, we can list the possible pairs \((p, q)\) and compute \( p \cdot q - (p + q) \).
  2. **Verification**:
     - By evaluating each pair, we find that none of the values compute to 194.
  Thus, the expression \( p \cdot q - (p + q) \) cannot be equal to 194.

  -- We need to show that the expression p * q - (p + q) cannot be equal to 194.
  -- First, we list all possible pairs (p, q) where p and q are primes between 4 and 18.
  have h₃ : p * q - (p + q) ≠ (194 : ℕ) := by
    -- We use a case analysis to check each possible pair (p, q).
    have h₄ : p * q - (p + q) ≤ 18 * 18 := by
      -- Since p and q are primes between 4 and 18, their product is at most 18 * 18.
      have : p ≤ 18 := by linarith
      have : q ≤ 18 := by linarith
      nlinarith
    -- We now check each possible pair (p, q) to see if it equals 194.
    interval_cases p <;> interval_cases q <;> norm_num at h₀ <;> omega
  -- By evaluating each pair, we find that none of the values compute to 194.
  -- Therefore, the expression p * q - (p + q) cannot be equal to 194.
