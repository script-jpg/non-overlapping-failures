  Given two different prime numbers \( p \) and \( q \) between 4 and 18, we need to show that the expression \( pq - (p + q) \) cannot be equal to 194. We will consider all possible pairs of primes within the specified range and verify that the expression does not yield 194 for any pair.

  -- We will consider all possible pairs of primes between 4 and 18 and check that the expression does not yield 194.
  have h₃ : p ≤ 18 := by linarith
  have h₄ : q ≤ 18 := by linarith
  -- We use interval_cases to consider all possible values of p and q within the range [4, 18].
  interval_cases p <;> interval_cases q <;> norm_num [Nat.Prime, Nat.succ_le_iff] at h₀ h₁ h₂ ⊢
  -- For each pair (p, q), we compute the expression pq - (p + q) and check if it equals 194.
  -- By examining all pairs, we find that none of them yield 194, thus proving the theorem.
