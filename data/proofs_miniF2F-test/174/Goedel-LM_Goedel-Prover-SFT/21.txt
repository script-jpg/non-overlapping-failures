  Given two different prime numbers \( p \) and \( q \) between 4 and 18, we need to show that the difference between their product and their sum is not 194. We will consider all pairs of primes within the specified range and verify that the expression \( p \times q - (p + q) \) does not equal 194.

  -- Consider all pairs of prime numbers p and q between 4 and 18.
  have h₀ := h₀.1
  have h₁ := h₀.2
  -- We know that p and q are primes and within the range [4, 18].
  have h₂ : p ≤ 18 := by linarith
  have h₃ : q ≤ 18 := by linarith
  have h₄ : p ≥ 4 := by linarith
  have h₅ : q ≥ 4 := by linarith
  -- We will check each pair (p, q) to ensure that the expression p * q - (p + q) is not 194.
