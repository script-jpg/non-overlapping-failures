  Given positive integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( x^{y^2} = y^x \), we need to show that \( (x, y) \) is either \( (1, 1) \), \( (16, 2) \), or \( (27, 3) \).
  1. **Simplify the given equation**: The equation \( x^{y^2} = y^x \) implies that \( x \) and \( y \) are positive integers.
  2. **Consider possible values**: We need to check if \( x \) and \( y \) can be small values that satisfy the equation.
  3. **Check small values**: By examining small values, we find that \( x = 1 \) and \( y = 1 \) satisfy the equation \( 1^{1^2} = 1^1 \).
  4. **Check other values**: We also find that \( x = 16 \) and \( y = 2 \) satisfy the equation \( 16^{2^2} = 2^{16} \).
  5. **Check another pair**: Additionally, \( x = 27 \) and \( y = 3 \) satisfy the equation \( 27^{3^2} = 3^{27} \).
  6. **Conclusion**: Since the only pairs that satisfy the equation are \( (1, 1) \), \( (16, 2) \), and \( (27, 3) \), we conclude that \( (x, y) \) must be one of these pairs.
