  Given positive integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( x^{y^2} = y^x \), we need to show that \( (x, y) \) is equal to \( (1, 1) \), \( (16, 2) \), or \( (27, 3) \).
  1. **Normalization and Simplification**: We start by normalizing the given equation \( x^{y^2} = y^x \).
  2. **Case Analysis**: We analyze the possible values of \( x \) and \( y \) by considering the constraints and solving the equation.
  3. **Verification**: We verify that the only solutions to the equation are \( (1, 1) \), \( (16, 2) \), and \( (27, 3) \).
