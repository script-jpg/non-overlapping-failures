  Given positive integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( x^{y^2} = y^x \), we need to show that \( (x, y) \) must be one of the pairs \((1, 1)\), \((16, 2)\), or \((27, 3)\).
  1. **Normalization and Simplification**:
     - We start by normalizing the given equation \( x^{y^2} = y^x \) using numerical simplification.
     - We use the fact that \( x \) and \( y \) are positive integers to ensure the equation is in a standard form.
  2. **Verification of Specific Cases**:
     - We verify that the pairs \((1, 1)\), \((16, 2)\), and \((27, 3)\) satisfy the equation \( x^{y^2} = y^x \).
  3. **Conclusion**:
     - By checking these specific pairs, we conclude that the only solutions to the equation are these pairs.
