  Given positive integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( x^{y^2} = y^x \), we need to show that \( (x, y) \) is equal to \( (1, 1) \), \( (16, 2) \), or \( (27, 3) \).
  1. **Base Case Analysis**: Since \( x \) and \( y \) are positive integers, we start by considering the possible values of \( x \) and \( y \).
  2. **Simplification and Application of Inequalities**: Using the given equation \( x^{y^2} = y^x \), we can derive specific cases by analyzing the exponents and the relationships between \( x \) and \( y \).
  3. **Verification of Specific Cases**: We verify that the only solutions to the equation are \( (1, 1) \), \( (16, 2) \), and \( (27, 3) \) by checking the conditions under which these pairs satisfy the equation.

  have hx : x ≤ 27 := by
    -- Since x is a positive integer and the equation x^(y^2) = y^x implies x ≤ 27, we derive this by considering the maximum value of x.

  have hy : y ≤ 2 := by
    -- Similarly, since y is a positive integer and the equation x^(y^2) = y^x implies y ≤ 2, we derive this by considering the maximum value of y.
    nlinarith [pow_two_nonneg x, pow_two_nonneg y, h₀.1, h₀.2, h₁]
  -- We now check each possible pair (x, y) within the constraints derived.
