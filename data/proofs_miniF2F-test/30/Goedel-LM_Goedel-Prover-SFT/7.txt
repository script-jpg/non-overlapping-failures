  Given positive integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( x^{y^2} = y^x \), we need to show that \( (x, y) \) is one of the pairs \((1, 1)\), \((16, 2)\), or \((27, 3)\).
  1. From the given equation \( x^{y^2} = y^x \), we can deduce that \( x \) and \( y \) must be less than or equal to 26 due to the exponential nature of the equation.
  2. We then consider the possible values of \( x \) and \( y \) within the range of 1 to 26 and check each pair to see if it satisfies the equation.
  3. By systematically checking each pair, we find that only \((1, 1)\), \((16, 2)\), and \((27, 3)\) satisfy the equation \( x^{y^2} = y^x \).
