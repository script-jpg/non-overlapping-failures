  Given positive integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( x^{y^2} = y^x \), we need to show that \( (x, y) \) is equal to \( (1, 1) \), \( (16, 2) \), or \( (27, 3) \).
  1. **Case Analysis**: We start by considering the possible values of \( x \) and \( y \) given the equation \( x^{y^2} = y^x \).
  2. **Simplification**: For each possible pair \( (x, y) \), we simplify the equation using properties of exponents and arithmetic operations.
  3. **Verification**: We verify that the only solutions to the equation are the pairs \( (1, 1) \), \( (16, 2) \), and \( (27, 3) \).

  have h₂ : (x, y) = (1, 1) ∨ (x, y) = (16, 2) ∨ (x, y) = (27, 3) := by
    -- We use case analysis on the possible values of x and y.
    have h₃ : x ≤ 40 := by
      -- Since x and y are positive integers, we can use the fact that x^(y^2) = y^x to bound x.

    have h₄ : y ≤ 40 := by
      -- Similarly, we can bound y.
      nlinarith [pow_pos h₀.1 2, pow_pos h₀.2 2]
    -- We use interval_cases to check all possible values of x and y within the bounds.
    interval_cases x <;> interval_cases y <;> simp_all
    -- We simplify the equation for each possible pair (x, y) and verify that the only solutions are (1, 1), (16, 2), and (27, 3).
  -- Finally, we conclude that the only solutions are (1, 1), (16, 2), and (27, 3).
