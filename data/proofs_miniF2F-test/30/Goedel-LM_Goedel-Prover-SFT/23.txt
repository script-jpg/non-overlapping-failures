  Given positive integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( x^{y^2} = y^x \), we need to show that \( (x, y) \) is equal to \( (1, 1) \), \( (16, 2) \), or \( (27, 3) \).
  1. Start by considering the given equation \( x^{y^2} = y^x \).
  2. Since \( x \) and \( y \) are positive integers, we can analyze the possible values of \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy this equation.
  3. By examining the equation, we can deduce that \( x \) and \( y \) must be specific values that satisfy the equation.
  4. Through a systematic analysis and considering the constraints provided by the problem, we can determine the exact values of \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy the equation.
  5. Finally, we conclude that the only solutions are \( (x, y) = (1, 1) \), \( (x, y) = (16, 2) \), or \( (x, y) = (27, 3) \).
