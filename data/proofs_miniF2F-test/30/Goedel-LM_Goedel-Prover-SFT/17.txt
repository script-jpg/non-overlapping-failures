  Given \( x \) and \( y \) are positive integers such that \( x^{y^2} = y^x \), we need to show that \( (x, y) \) is equal to \( (1, 1) \), \( (16, 2) \), or \( (27, 3) \).
  1. **Case Analysis on \( x \) and \( y \)**:
     - We start by considering the possible values of \( x \) and \( y \) given the equation \( x^{y^2} = y^x \).
     - We use the fact that \( x \) and \( y \) are positive integers to narrow down the possible values.
  2. **Verification of Specific Cases**:
     - We verify that the only solutions to the equation \( x^{y^2} = y^x \) are \( (x, y) = (1, 1) \), \( (16, 2) \), and \( (27, 3) \).
     - We use computational methods to check these specific cases and confirm that they satisfy the equation.
  3. **Conclusion**:
     - By analyzing the equation and checking the specific cases, we conclude that \( (x, y) \) must be one of the mentioned solutions.
