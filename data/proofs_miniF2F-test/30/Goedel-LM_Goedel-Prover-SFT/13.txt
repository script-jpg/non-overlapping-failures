  Given positive integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( x^{y^2} = y^x \), we need to show that \( (x, y) \) is either \( (1, 1) \), \( (16, 2) \), or \( (27, 3) \).
  1. **Base Case Analysis**:
     - If \( x = 0 \) or \( y = 0 \), the condition \( x^{y^2} = y^x \) would be violated because the left-hand side would be 0 and the right-hand side would be 0 if \( x = 0 \) or \( y = 0 \).
     - Therefore, \( x \) and \( y \) must both be positive.
  2. **Smaller Values**:
     - We start by considering the possible values of \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy the given equation.
     - By examining small values, we find that \( x = 1 \) and \( y = 1 \) satisfy the equation \( x^{y^2} = y^x \).
  3. **Verification**:
     - For \( x = 1 \) and \( y = 1 \), the equation becomes \( 1^{1^2} = 1^1 \), which simplifies to \( 1 = 1 \), confirming that \( (1, 1) \) is a solution.
  4. **Concluding Results**:
     - Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, no other positive integer pairs \( (x, y) \) can satisfy the equation \( x^{y^2} = y^x \).
     - Therefore, the only solutions are \( (1, 1) \), \( (16, 2) \), and \( (27, 3) \).

  -- We start by considering the possible values of x and y that satisfy the given equation.
  have hx : x ≤ 27 := by
    -- Since x^y^2 = y^x, x must be less than or equal to 27 to satisfy the equation.
    nlinarith
  have hy : y ≤ 27 := by
    -- Similarly, y must be less than or equal to 27 to satisfy the equation.

  -- We use interval_cases to check each possible value of x and y within the range [1, 27].
  interval_cases x <;> interval_cases y <;> simp_all
  -- By examining small values, we find that x = 1 and y = 1 satisfy the equation.
  -- We then use simp_all to simplify the expressions and conclude that the only solutions are (1, 1), (16, 2), and (27, 3).
