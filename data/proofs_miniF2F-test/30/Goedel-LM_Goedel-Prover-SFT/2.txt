  Given positive integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( x^{y^2} = y^x \), we need to show that \( (x, y) \) is one of the pairs \((1, 1)\), \((16, 2)\), or \((27, 3)\).
  1. From the given equation \( x^{y^2} = y^x \), we can deduce that \( x \) and \( y \) must be positive integers.
  2. We start by considering the possible values of \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy the equation.
  3. We use the fact that \( x \) and \( y \) are positive integers and the equation \( x^{y^2} = y^x \) to narrow down the possible values.
  4. By examining the equation and considering the constraints, we can deduce that the only solutions are \( (x, y) = (1, 1) \), \( (x, y) = (16, 2) \), or \( (x, y) = (27, 3) \).
