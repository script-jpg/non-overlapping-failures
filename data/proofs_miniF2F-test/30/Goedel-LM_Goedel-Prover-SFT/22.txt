  We need to show that if \( x \) and \( y \) are positive integers such that \( x^{y^2} = y^x \), then \( (x, y) \) is equal to \( (1, 1) \), \( (16, 2) \), or \( (27, 3) \).
  1. **Case Analysis**: We start by analyzing the given equation \( x^{y^2} = y^x \).
  2. **Simplification**: Using the given conditions, we simplify the equation to find possible values for \( x \) and \( y \).
  3. **Verification**: We verify that the only solutions to the equation are \( (1, 1) \), \( (16, 2) \), and \( (27, 3) \).
