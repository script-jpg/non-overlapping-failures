  Given positive integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( x^{y^2} = y^x \), we need to show that \( (x, y) \) is one of the pairs \((1, 1)\), \((16, 2)\), or \((27, 3)\).
  1. **Normalization and Simplification**: We start by normalizing the given equation \( x^{y^2} = y^x \).
  2. **Case Analysis**: We analyze the possible values of \( x \) and \( y \) by considering the constraints and the equation.
  3. **Verification**: We verify that the only solutions to the equation are the pairs \((1, 1)\), \((16, 2)\), and \((27, 3)\).
