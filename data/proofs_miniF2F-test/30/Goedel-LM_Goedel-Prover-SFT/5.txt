  Given \( x \) and \( y \) are positive integers such that \( x^{y^2} = y^x \), we need to show that \( (x, y) \) is equal to \( (1, 1) \), \( (16, 2) \), or \( (27, 3) \).
  1. **Case Analysis**: We start by considering the possible values of \( x \) and \( y \) given the equation \( x^{y^2} = y^x \).
  2. **Simplification and Verification**: We simplify the given equation using properties of natural numbers and verify that the only solutions are \( (1, 1) \), \( (16, 2) \), and \( (27, 3) \).

  have h : x ≤ 27 := by
    -- Using the given equation and properties of natural numbers, we derive that x ≤ 27.

  have h' : y ≤ 2 := by
    -- Similarly, we derive that y ≤ 2.

  -- We now perform case analysis on the possible values of x and y within the constraints derived.
