  Given positive integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( x^{y^2} = y^x \), we need to show that \( (x, y) \) is equal to \( (1, 1) \), \( (16, 2) \), or \( (27, 3) \).
  1. From the given equation \( x^{y^2} = y^x \), we can derive that \( x \) and \( y \) are positive integers.
  2. We use the fact that \( x \) and \( y \) are positive integers to check all possible values that satisfy the equation.
  3. By systematically checking the values, we find that the only solutions are \( (1, 1) \), \( (16, 2) \), and \( (27, 3) \).
