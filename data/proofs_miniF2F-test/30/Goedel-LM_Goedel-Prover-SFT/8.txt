  Given positive integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( x^{y^2} = y^x \), we need to show that \( (x, y) \) is one of the pairs \((1, 1)\), \((16, 2)\), or \((27, 3)\).
  1. **Case Analysis**: We start by considering the possible values of \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy the given equation.
  2. **Verification**: We verify that for \( x = 1 \) and \( y = 1 \), \( x^{y^2} = y^x \) holds true.
  3. **Exclusion**: We show that no other pairs \((x, y)\) satisfy the equation by examining the possible values and their implications.

  have h₁' := h₀.1 -- Extract the positivity condition for x from h₀.
  have h₂ : x ≤ 27 := by
    -- Since x and y are positive integers, we can use the given equation to derive a bound on x.

    have hx' : x ^ y ^ 2 ≥ 28 ^ y ^ 2 := by gcongr
    have hy : y ^ x ≥ 28 ^ x := by gcongr
    linarith
  have h₃ : y ≤ 27 := by
    -- Similarly, we derive a bound on y.
    apply Nat.le_of_not_lt
    intro h
    have hy : y ≥ 28 := by linarith
    have hy' : y ^ x ≥ 28 ^ x := by gcongr
    have hx : x ^ y ^ 2 ≥ 28 ^ y ^ 2 := by gcongr
    linarith
  interval_cases x <;> interval_cases y <;> simp_all
  -- By examining the possible values of x and y within the bounds derived, we conclude the required pairs.
