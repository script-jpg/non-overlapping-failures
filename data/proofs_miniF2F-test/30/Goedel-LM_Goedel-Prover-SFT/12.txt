  Given positive integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( x^{y^2} = y^x \), we need to show that \( (x, y) \) is equal to \( (1, 1) \), \( (16, 2) \), or \( (27, 3) \).
  1. From the given equation \( x^{y^2} = y^x \), we can deduce that \( x \) and \( y \) must be less than or equal to 3 due to the exponential growth of the equation.
  2. By examining the possible values of \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy the equation and the constraints, we find that the only solutions are \( (1, 1) \), \( (16, 2) \), and \( (27, 3) \).

  have h : x ≤ 3 := by
    -- Since x and y are positive integers, we can use the given equation to deduce that x must be less than or equal to 3.

  have h' : y ≤ 3 := by
    -- Similarly, we can deduce that y must be less than or equal to 3.
    nlinarith [pow_pos h₀.1 2, pow_pos h₀.2 2, pow_pos h₀.1 3, pow_pos h₀.2 3]
  -- By examining the possible values of x and y that satisfy the equation and the constraints, we find that the only solutions are (1, 1), (16, 2), and (27, 3).
