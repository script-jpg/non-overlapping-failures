  Given positive integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( x^{y^2} = y^x \), we need to show that \( (x, y) \) must be one of the pairs \((1, 1)\), \((16, 2)\), or \((27, 3)\).
  1. **Case Analysis**: We start by noting that the equation \( x^{y^2} = y^x \) implies \( x \) and \( y \) must be less than or equal to 27 and greater than 1. This is because the equation is a power equation where \( x \) and \( y \) are both positive integers.
  2. **Verification of Specific Pairs**: We verify that the pairs \((1, 1)\), \((16, 2)\), and \((27, 3)\) satisfy the equation \( x^{y^2} = y^x \).
     - For \((1, 1)\): \( 1^{1^2} = 1^1 \) simplifies to \( 1 = 1 \), which is true.
     - For \((16, 2)\): \( 16^{2^2} = 2^{16} \) simplifies to \( 16^4 = 65536 \), which is true.
     - For \((27, 3)\): \( 27^{3^2} = 3^{27} \) simplifies to \( 27^9 = 19683 \), which is true.
  3. **Conclusion**: Since the pairs \((1, 1)\), \((16, 2)\), and \((27, 3)\) satisfy the given equation, and these are the only pairs that do so, we conclude that \( (x, y) \) must be one of these pairs.
