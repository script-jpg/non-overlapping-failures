  We need to show that for any integer $n \geq 3$, the following inequality holds: $n! < n^{n-1}$.
  We will use mathematical induction on $n$.

  The base case is when $n = 3$:
  $3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6$ and $3^{3-1} = 3^2 = 9$.
  Clearly, $6 < 9$ so the base case holds.

  For the inductive step, we assume the inequality holds for some integer $k \geq 3$, i.e., $k! < k^{k-1}$.
  We need to show that $(k+1)! < (k+1)^{k}$.

  We know that $(k+1)! = (k+1) \times k!$ by the definition of factorial.
  By the inductive hypothesis, $k! < k^{k-1}$.
  So, $(k+1)! = (k+1) \times k! < (k+1) \times k^{k-1}$.

  Now, we need to show that $(k+1) \times k^{k-1} < (k+1)^{k}$.
  This can be rewritten as $k^{k-1} < (k+1)^{k-1}$, which is true because $k < k+1$ and the function $f(x) = x^{k-1}$ is strictly increasing for $x > 0$ when $k-1 > 0$ (which follows from our assumption $k \geq 3$).

  Combining these, we get $(k+1)! < (k+1)^{k}$, completing the inductive step.

  Therefore, by mathematical induction, the inequality $n! < n^{n-1}$ holds for all integers $n \geq 3$.
