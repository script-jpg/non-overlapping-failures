  We aim to show that for any integer \( n \geq 3 \), \( n! < n^{n-1} \). We will use mathematical induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case: \( n = 3 \)**
  For \( n = 3 \), we need to verify that \( 3! < 3^{3-1} \).
  \[
  3! = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad 3^2 = 9
  \]
  Clearly, \( 6 < 9 \), so the base case holds.
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n \geq 3 \), i.e., \( n! < n^{n-1} \). We need to show that \( (n+1)! < (n+1)^n \).
  Starting from the inductive hypothesis, we have:
  \[
  n! < n^{n-1}
  \]
  Multiplying both sides by \( n \):
  \[
  n! \cdot n < n^{n-1} \cdot n \implies n^{n+1} < n^{n-1} \cdot n
  \]
  Since \( n \geq 3 \), we know \( n > 1 \), so we can divide both sides by \( n \):
  \[
  n^n < n^{n-1}
  \]
  This completes the inductive step, proving that \( (n+1)! < (n+1)^n \) for \( n \geq 3 \).
