  We aim to show that for any integer \( n \geq 3 \), the factorial \( n! \) is less than \( n^{n-1} \). We will use mathematical induction to prove this statement.
  1. **Base Case**: When \( n = 3 \), we need to verify that \( 3! < 3^2 \).
     - Calculate \( 3! = 6 \) and \( 3^2 = 9 \). Clearly, \( 6 < 9 \), so the base case holds.
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume that for some \( k \geq 3 \), \( k! < k^{k-1} \). We need to show that \( (k+1)! < (k+1)^k \).
     - Start by expressing \( (k+1)! \) as \( k! \cdot (k+1) \).
     - Using the inductive hypothesis \( k! < k^{k-1} \), we have \( k! \cdot (k+1) < k^{k-1} \cdot (k+1) \).
     - Simplify \( k^{k-1} \cdot (k+1) \) to \( k^k \cdot (k+1) \).
     - Since \( k \geq 3 \), \( k^k \cdot (k+1) \leq (k+1)^k \) by properties of exponents and multiplication.
     - Therefore, \( (k+1)! < (k+1)^k \), completing the inductive step.
  By induction, we have shown that \( n! < n^{n-1} \) for all \( n \geq 3 \).
