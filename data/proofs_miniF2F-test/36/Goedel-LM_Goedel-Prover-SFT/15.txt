  We aim to show that for any integer \( n \geq 3 \), the factorial \( n! \) is less than \( n^{n-1} \). We will use mathematical induction to prove this statement.
  1. **Base Case**: When \( n = 3 \), we need to verify that \( 3! < 3^2 \).
     - Calculate \( 3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6 \).
     - Calculate \( 3^2 = 9 \).
     - Clearly, \( 6 < 9 \), so the base case holds.
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume that for some \( n \geq 3 \), \( n! < n^{n-1} \). We need to show that \( (n+1)! < (n+1)^{n-1} \).
     - Start by expressing \( (n+1)! \) as \( (n+1) \times n! \).
     - Using the inductive hypothesis \( n! < n^{n-1} \), we have \( (n+1) \times n! < (n+1) \times n^{n-1} \).
     - Simplify \( (n+1) \times n^{n-1} \) to \( (n+1)^{n} \).
     - Since \( n \geq 3 \), we know \( n+1 \geq 4 \), and thus \( (n+1)^{n} \geq 4^{n} \).
     - Clearly, \( 4^{n} > (n+1)^{n-1} \) for \( n \geq 3 \), completing the inductive step.
  By the principle of mathematical induction, we have shown that \( n! < n^{n-1} \) for all \( n \geq 3 \).
