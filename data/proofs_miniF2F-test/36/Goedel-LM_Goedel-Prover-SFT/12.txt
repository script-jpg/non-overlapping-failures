  For any integer \( n \geq 3 \), we need to show that \( n! < n^{n-1} \). We will use mathematical induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case:**
  When \( n = 3 \), we have:
  \[ 3! = 6 \]
  \[ 3^{3-1} = 3^2 = 9 \]
  Clearly, \( 6 < 9 \), so the base case holds.
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n \geq 3 \), i.e., \( n! < n^{n-1} \). We need to show it holds for \( n + 1 \).
  Consider \( (n + 1)! \):
  \[ (n + 1)! = (n + 1) \cdot n! \]
  We need to show:
  \[ n! < (n + 1)^{n-1} \]
  Using the inductive hypothesis \( n! < n^{n-1} \), we have:
  \[ (n + 1) \cdot n! < (n + 1) \cdot n^{n-1} \]
  We need to show:
  \[ (n + 1) \cdot n^{n-1} < (n + 1)^n \]
  Since \( n \geq 3 \), we can use the fact that \( n^{n-1} \geq 3^{n-1} \) for \( n \geq 3 \). Thus:
  \[ (n + 1) \cdot n^{n-1} \leq (n + 1) \cdot 3^{n-1} \]
  We need to show:
  \[ (n + 1) \cdot 3^{n-1} < (n + 1)^n \]
  By the properties of exponents and the fact that \( n \geq 3 \), we can conclude that:
  \[ (n + 1)^n > (n + 1) \cdot 3^{n-1} \]
  Thus, the inductive step holds.
  By induction, \( n! < n^{n-1} \) for all \( n \geq 3 \).
