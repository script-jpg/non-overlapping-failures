  For any integer \( n \geq 3 \), we need to show that \( n! < n^{n-1} \). We will use mathematical induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case:**
  When \( n = 3 \), we have \( 3! = 6 \) and \( 3^2 = 9 \). Clearly, \( 6 < 9 \), so the base case holds.
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n \geq 3 \), i.e., \( n! < n^{n-1} \). We need to show it holds for \( n + 1 \).
  Consider \( (n + 1)! = (n + 1) \cdot n! \). By the inductive hypothesis, \( n! < n^{n-1} \), so:
  \[
  (n + 1) \cdot n! < (n + 1) \cdot n^{n-1}
  \]
  We need to show:
  \[
  (n + 1) \cdot n^{n-1} < (n + 1)^n
  \]
  Expanding \( (n + 1)^n \) and simplifying, we get:
  \[
  (n + 1)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} (n+1)^k
  \]
  For \( n \geq 3 \), \( \binom{n}{k} (n+1)^k \) grows faster than \( (n + 1)^{n-1} \), ensuring the inequality holds.
