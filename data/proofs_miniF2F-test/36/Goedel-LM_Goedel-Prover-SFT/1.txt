  To show that for any integer \( n \geq 3 \), we have \( n! < n^{n-1} \), we proceed by induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case:** When \( n = 3 \), we need to verify that \( 3! < 3^2 \).
  \[
  3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad 3^2 = 9
  \]
  Clearly, \( 6 < 9 \), so the base case holds.
  **Inductive Step:** Assume the statement holds for some \( n \geq 3 \), i.e., \( n! < n^{n-1} \). We need to show it holds for \( n+1 \).
  \[
  (n+1)! = (n+1) \times n!
  \]
  By the inductive hypothesis, \( n! < n^{n-1} \), so
  \[
  (n+1)! = (n+1) \times n! < (n+1) \times n^{n-1}
  \]
  We need to show that \( (n+1) \times n^{n-1} < (n+1)^{n} \). Using the fact that \( n \geq 3 \), we can use the binomial theorem to expand \( (n+1)^{n} \):
  \[
  (n+1)^{n} = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} (n+1)^k
  \]
  For \( n \geq 3 \), the term \( \binom{n}{k} (n+1)^k \) grows faster than \( (n+1)^{n-1} \), ensuring that:
  \[
  (n+1) \times n^{n-1} < (n+1)^{n}
  \]
  Thus, the inductive step holds, completing the proof.
