  We aim to show that for any integer \( n \geq 3 \), the factorial \( n! \) is less than \( n^{n-1} \). We will use mathematical induction to prove this statement.
  **Base Case:**
  For \( n = 3 \), we need to verify that \( 3! < 3^{3-1} \).
  \[
  3! = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad 3^2 = 9
  \]
  Clearly, \( 6 < 9 \), so the base case holds.
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( k \geq 3 \), i.e., \( k! < k^{k-1} \). We need to show that the statement holds for \( k + 1 \), i.e., \( (k+1)! < (k+1)^k \).
  Starting from the inductive hypothesis \( k! < k^{k-1} \), we have:
  \[
  (k+1)! = (k+1) \cdot k! < (k+1) \cdot k^{k-1}
  \]
  We need to show that:
  \[
  (k+1) \cdot k^{k-1} < (k+1)^k
  \]
  Expanding \( (k+1)^k \):
  \[
  (k+1)^k = \sum_{i=0}^{k} \binom{k}{i} (k+1)^i
  \]
  We need to prove that:
  \[
  (k+1) \cdot k^{k-1} < \sum_{i=0}^{k} \binom{k}{i} (k+1)^i
  \]
  Since \( k \geq 3 \), we can use the fact that \( \binom{k}{i} \) grows slower than \( (k+1)^i \), and the sum of these terms is greater than \( (k+1) \cdot k^{k-1} \).
  Thus, by induction, the statement holds for all \( n \geq 3 \).
