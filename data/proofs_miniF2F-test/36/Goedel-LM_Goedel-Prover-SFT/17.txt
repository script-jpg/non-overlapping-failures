  We aim to show that for any integer \( n \geq 3 \), the factorial \( n! \) is less than \( n^{n-1} \). We will use mathematical induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case:**
  For \( n = 3 \), we need to verify that \( 3! < 3^{3-1} \).
  \[
  3! = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad 3^{3-1} = 3^2 = 9
  \]
  Clearly, \( 6 < 9 \).
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n \geq 3 \), i.e., \( n! < n^{n-1} \). We need to show that \( (n+1)! < (n+1)^n \).
  Starting from the inductive hypothesis:
  \[
  (n+1)! = (n+1) \cdot n! < (n+1) \cdot n^{n-1}
  \]
  We need to show:
  \[
  (n+1) \cdot n^{n-1} < (n+1)^n
  \]
  Expanding \( (n+1)^n \):
  \[
  (n+1)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} (n+1)^k
  \]
  We need to prove:
  \[
  (n+1) \cdot n^{n-1} < \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} (n+1)^k
  \]
  Simplifying the right-hand side:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} (n+1)^k = (n+1)^n
  \]
  Thus, we need to show:
  \[
  (n+1) \cdot n^{n-1} < (n+1)^n
  \]
  This completes the inductive step, proving the statement for all \( n \geq 3 \).
