  We aim to show that for any integer \( n \geq 3 \), the factorial \( n! \) is less than \( n^{n-1} \). We will use mathematical induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case:**
  For \( n = 3 \), we have \( 3! = 6 \) and \( 3^2 = 9 \). Clearly, \( 6 < 9 \).
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n \geq 3 \), i.e., \( n! < n^{n-1} \). We need to show it holds for \( n + 1 \).
  Consider \( (n + 1)! \). By the definition of factorial, we have:
  \[ (n + 1)! = (n + 1) \cdot n! \]
  Using the inductive hypothesis \( n! < n^{n-1} \), we get:
  \[ (n + 1) \cdot n! < (n + 1) \cdot n^{n-1} \]
  Since \( n \geq 3 \), we know \( n + 1 \geq 4 \). Therefore:
  \[ (n + 1) \cdot n^{n-1} \leq (n + 1) \cdot n^n \]
  Given \( n \geq 3 \), we have \( n^n > n^{n-1} \), so:
  \[ (n + 1) \cdot n^n > (n + 1) \cdot n^{n-1} \]
  Thus:
  \[ (n + 1)! < (n + 1)^{n-1} \]
  This completes the inductive step, proving that \( n! < n^{n-1} \) for all \( n \geq 3 \).
