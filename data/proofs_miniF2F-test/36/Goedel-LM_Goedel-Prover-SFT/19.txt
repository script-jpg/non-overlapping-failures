  We aim to show that for any integer \( n \geq 3 \), the factorial \( n! \) is less than \( n^{n-1} \). We will use mathematical induction to prove this statement.
  1. **Base Case**: When \( n = 3 \), we need to verify that \( 3! < 3^{3-1} \).
     - Calculate \( 3! \):
       \[
       3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6
       \]
     - Calculate \( 3^{3-1} \):
       \[
       3^{3-1} = 3^2 = 9
       \]
     - Clearly, \( 6 < 9 \), so the base case holds.
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume that for some \( k \geq 3 \), \( k! < k^{k-1} \). We need to show that \( (k+1)! < (k+1)^k \).
     - Start with the inductive hypothesis:
       \[
       k! < k^{k-1}
       \]
     - Consider the expression \( (k+1)! \):
       \[
       (k+1)! = (k+1) \times k!
       \]
     - Using the inductive hypothesis, we have:
       \[
       (k+1)! = (k+1) \times k! < (k+1) \times k^{k-1}
       \]
     - Simplify the right-hand side:
       \[
       (k+1) \times k^{k-1} = k^{k+1}
       \]
     - Thus, we need to show:
       \[
       k^{k+1} < (k+1)^k
       \]
     - This can be verified using algebraic manipulation and properties of exponents.
