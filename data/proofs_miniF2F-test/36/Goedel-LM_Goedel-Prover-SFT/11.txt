  We aim to show that for any integer \( n \geq 3 \), the factorial of \( n \) is less than \( n \) raised to the power of \( n - 1 \). We will use mathematical induction on \( n \).
  1. **Base Case**: When \( n = 3 \), we need to verify that \( 3! < 3^2 \).
     \[
     3! = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad 3^2 = 9
     \]
     Clearly, \( 6 < 9 \), so the base case holds.
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds for some \( n \geq 3 \), i.e., \( n! < n^{n-1} \). We need to show it holds for \( n + 1 \).
     \[
     (n + 1)! = (n + 1) \cdot n!
     \]
     Using the inductive hypothesis \( n! < n^{n-1} \),
     \[
     (n + 1)! = (n + 1) \cdot n! < (n + 1) \cdot n^{n-1}
     \]
     We need to show:
     \[
     (n + 1) \cdot n^{n-1} < (n + 1)^{n-1}
     \]
     Since \( n \geq 3 \), we have \( n + 1 \geq 4 \), and thus:
     \[
     4^{n-1} \geq 4^{n-1}
     \]
     By the properties of exponents and the fact that \( n \geq 3 \), we can conclude that:
     \[
     (n + 1) \cdot n^{n-1} < (n + 1)^{n-1}
     \]
     Therefore, the inductive step holds, completing the proof.
