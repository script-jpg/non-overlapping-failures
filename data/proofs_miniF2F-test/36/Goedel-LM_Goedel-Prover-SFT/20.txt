  We aim to show that for any integer \( n \geq 3 \), the factorial of \( n \) is less than \( n^{n-1} \). We proceed by induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case:**
  For \( n = 3 \), we have \( 3! = 6 \) and \( 3^2 = 9 \). Clearly, \( 6 < 9 \), so the base case holds.
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n \geq 3 \), i.e., \( n! < n^{n-1} \). We need to show it holds for \( n + 1 \).
  Starting from \( (n+1)! = (n+1) \cdot n! \), we need to show:
  \[ (n+1) \cdot n! < (n+1)^{n} \]
  Using the inductive hypothesis \( n! < n^{n-1} \), we can rewrite the inequality as:
  \[ (n+1) \cdot n! < (n+1)^{n} \]
  Since \( n \geq 3 \), we know \( n+1 \geq 4 \). We can use the fact that \( n^{n-1} < (n+1)^{n-1} \) for \( n \geq 3 \) to conclude the proof.
