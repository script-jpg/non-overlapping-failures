  We aim to show that for any integer \( n \geq 3 \), the factorial of \( n \) is less than \( n \) raised to the power of \( n-1 \). We will use mathematical induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case:**
  For \( n = 3 \), we need to verify that \( 3! < 3^2 \).
  \[
  3! = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad 3^2 = 9
  \]
  Clearly, \( 6 < 9 \), so the base case holds.
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n \geq 3 \), i.e., \( n! < n^{n-1} \). We need to show it holds for \( n + 1 \), i.e., \( (n+1)! < (n+1)^n \).
  Starting from the inductive hypothesis \( n! < n^{n-1} \), we have:
  \[
  (n+1)! = (n+1) \cdot n!
  \]
  Using the inductive hypothesis, we get:
  \[
  (n+1) \cdot n! < (n+1) \cdot n^{n-1}
  \]
  Since \( n \geq 3 \), we know \( n+1 \geq 4 \). We need to show:
  \[
  (n+1) \cdot n^{n-1} < (n+1)^n
  \]
  Expanding \( (n+1)^n \):
  \[
  (n+1)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} (n+1)^{n-k}
  \]
  For \( n \geq 3 \), the term \( \binom{n}{k} (n+1)^{n-k} \) is less than \( (n+1)^n \) for \( k \leq n \). Therefore, we have:
  \[
  (n+1) \cdot n^{n-1} < (n+1)^n
  \]
  Thus, by induction, the statement holds for all \( n \geq 3 \).
