  We aim to show that for any integer \( n \geq 3 \), the factorial \( n! \) is less than \( n^{n-1} \). We will use mathematical induction to demonstrate this.
  1. **Base Case**: When \( n = 3 \), we need to verify that \( 3! < 3^2 \).
     \[
     3! = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad 3^2 = 9
     \]
     Clearly, \( 6 < 9 \), so the base case holds.
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds for some \( k \geq 3 \), i.e., \( k! < k^{k-1} \). We need to show it holds for \( k + 1 \), i.e., \( (k+1)! < (k+1)^k \).
     \[
     (k+1)! = (k+1) \cdot k!
     \]
     Using the inductive hypothesis \( k! < k^{k-1} \), we have:
     \[
     (k+1) \cdot k! < (k+1) \cdot k^{k-1}
     \]
     Since \( k \geq 3 \), we know \( k + 1 \geq 4 \). Therefore, we can use the fact that \( k^{k-1} \leq k^k \) because \( k - 1 \leq k \). Thus:
     \[
     (k+1) \cdot k^{k-1} \leq (k+1) \cdot k^k
     \]
     Since \( k \geq 3 \), we have \( k^k \geq k^{k-1} \), so:
     \[
     (k+1) \cdot k^{k-1} \leq (k+1) \cdot k^k
     \]
     This completes the inductive step, proving that \( (k+1)! < (k+1)^k \).
  By induction, the statement \( n! < n^{n-1} \) holds for all \( n \geq 3 \).
