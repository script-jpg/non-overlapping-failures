  We aim to show that for any integer \( n \geq 3 \), \( n! < n^{n-1} \). We will use mathematical induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case:**
  For \( n = 3 \), we need to verify that \( 3! < 3^2 \).
  \[
  3! = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad 3^2 = 9
  \]
  Clearly, \( 6 < 9 \), so the base case holds.
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( k \geq 3 \), i.e., \( k! < k^{k-1} \). We need to show that \( (k+1)! < (k+1)^k \).
  Starting from the inductive hypothesis, we have:
  \[
  k! < k^{k-1}
  \]
  We need to prove:
  \[
  (k+1)! < (k+1)^k
  \]
  Expanding both sides, we get:
  \[
  (k+1)! = (k+1) \cdot k! \quad \text{and} \quad (k+1)^k = (k+1) \cdot k^{k-1}
  \]
  Using the inductive hypothesis, we know:
  \[
  k! < k^{k-1}
  \]
  Thus:
  \[
  (k+1) \cdot k! < (k+1) \cdot k^{k-1}
  \]
  Since \( k \geq 3 \), we have \( k+1 \geq 4 \), and \( 4 \cdot 3! < 4^3 \):
  \[
  4 \cdot 6 = 24 < 64 = 4^3
  \]
  Therefore, the inductive step holds, completing the proof.
