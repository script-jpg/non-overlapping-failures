  For any integer \( n \geq 3 \), we need to show that \( n! < n^{n-1} \). We will use mathematical induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case:**
  When \( n = 3 \), we need to verify that \( 3! < 3^2 \).
  \[
  3! = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad 3^2 = 9
  \]
  Clearly, \( 6 < 9 \).
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n \geq 3 \), i.e., \( n! < n^{n-1} \). We need to show it holds for \( n + 1 \), i.e., \( (n+1)! < (n+1)^n \).
  Starting from the inductive hypothesis:
  \[
  n! < n^{n-1}
  \]
  Multiplying both sides by \( n + 1 \):
  \[
  (n+1) \cdot n! < (n+1) \cdot n^{n-1}
  \]
  Since \( (n+1) \cdot n^{n-1} = (n+1)^n \), we have:
  \[
  (n+1)! = (n+1) \cdot n! < (n+1) \cdot n^{n-1} = (n+1)^n
  \]
  Thus, the statement holds for \( n + 1 \). By induction, the statement is true for all \( n \geq 3 \).
