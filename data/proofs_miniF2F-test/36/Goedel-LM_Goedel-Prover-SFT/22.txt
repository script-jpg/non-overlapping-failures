  We aim to show that for any integer \( n \geq 3 \), the factorial of \( n \) is less than \( n \) raised to the power of \( n-1 \). We proceed by induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case:**
  For \( n = 3 \), we need to verify that \( 3! < 3^2 \).
  \[
  3! = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad 3^2 = 9
  \]
  Clearly, \( 6 < 9 \).
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n \geq 3 \), i.e., \( n! < n^{n-1} \). We need to show it holds for \( n + 1 \).
  \[
  (n + 1)! = (n + 1) \cdot n!
  \]
  By the inductive hypothesis, \( n! < n^{n-1} \). Since \( n \geq 3 \), we have \( n + 1 \geq 4 \), and thus \( (n + 1) \cdot n! \leq (n + 1) \cdot n^{n-1} \).
  Using the fact that \( n \geq 3 \), we know \( n^{n-1} \geq n^2 \). Therefore,
  \[
  (n + 1) \cdot n^{n-1} \leq (n + 1) \cdot n^2
  \]
  Since \( n \geq 3 \), \( n + 1 \geq 4 \), and thus:
  \[
  (n + 1) \cdot n^2 \leq (n + 1)^2
  \]
  Thus, \( (n + 1)! \leq (n + 1)^2 \), completing the inductive step.
  By induction, the statement holds for all \( n \geq 3 \).
