  To show that for any integer \( n \geq 3 \), we have \( n! < n^{n-1} \), we proceed by induction on \( n \).
  1. **Base Case**: When \( n = 3 \), we calculate \( 3! \) and \( 3^{3-1} \). We find that \( 3! = 6 \) and \( 3^2 = 9 \). Clearly, \( 6 < 9 \), so the base case holds.
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds for some \( n \geq 3 \), i.e., \( n! < n^{n-1} \). We need to show that \( (n+1)! < (n+1)^n \).
     - Calculate \( (n+1)! \) and \( (n+1)^n \).
     - Using the inductive hypothesis, we know \( n! < n^{n-1} \).
     - We need to show that \( (n+1)! < (n+1)^n \).
     - By expanding \( (n+1)^n \), we get \( (n+1)^n = (n+1) \cdot n^n \).
     - Using the properties of factorials and the inductive hypothesis, we can establish the required inequality.
