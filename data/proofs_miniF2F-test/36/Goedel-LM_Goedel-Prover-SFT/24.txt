  We aim to show that for any integer \( n \geq 3 \), \( n! < n^{n-1} \). We will use mathematical induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case:**
  For \( n = 3 \), we need to verify that \( 3! < 3^2 \).
  \[
  3! = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad 3^2 = 9
  \]
  Clearly, \( 6 < 9 \), so the base case holds.
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n \geq 3 \), i.e., \( n! < n^{n-1} \). We need to show that it holds for \( n+1 \), i.e., \( (n+1)! < (n+1)^n \).
  Starting from the inductive hypothesis:
  \[
  n! < n^{n-1}
  \]
  Multiplying both sides by \( n+1 \):
  \[
  (n+1)n! < (n+1)n^{n-1}
  \]
  Since \( n \geq 3 \), we have \( n+1 \geq 4 \), and thus:
  \[
  (n+1)n^{n-1} \leq (n+1)^n
  \]
  Therefore:
  \[
  (n+1)n! < (n+1)^n
  \]
  This completes the inductive step, proving the statement for all \( n \geq 3 \).
