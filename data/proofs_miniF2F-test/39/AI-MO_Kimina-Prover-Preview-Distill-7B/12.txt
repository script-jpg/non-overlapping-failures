-- We need to find a counterexample to this statement.
  -- Let's try a = 2, b = 2.
  -- This is a case where both a and b are even, but $8 \nmid a^2 + b^2$.
  -- Let's prove this formally.

  -- Now, we need to prove the negation of the original statement.
  -- The original statement is: for all integers a and b, both a and b are even iff 8 divides a^2 + b^2.
  -- To prove this is false, we need to find a counterexample where:
  -- (1) both a and b are even, but 8 does not divide a^2 + b^2, or
  -- (2) 8 divides a^2 + b^2, but not both a and b are even.

  -- (1) is the case here with a = 2, b = 2:
  -- a = 2 = 2 * 1, so there exists i = 1 such that a = 2 * i
  -- b = 2 = 2 * 1, so there exists j = 1 such that b = 2 * j
  -- However, a^2 + b^2 = 2^2 + 2^2 = 4 + 4 = 8
  -- 8 = 8 * 1, so k = 1 satisfies 8 = 8 * k
  -- So this is actually a case where both a and b are even and 8 divides a^2 + b^2.
  -- Therefore it's not a counterexample.

  -- Let's try a different example: a = 2, b = 4:
  -- a = 2 = 2 * 1, so there exists i = 1 such that a = 2 * i
  -- b = 4 = 2 * 2, so there exists j = 2 such that b = 2 * j
  -- a^2 + b^2 = 4 + 16 = 20
  -- 20 = 8 * 2 + 4, so 8 does not divide 20.
  -- So (1) is satisfied with a = 2, b = 4 as a counterexample.

  -- Let's complete the proof with this counterexample:
