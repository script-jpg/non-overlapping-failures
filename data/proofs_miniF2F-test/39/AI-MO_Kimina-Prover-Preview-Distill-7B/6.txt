-- We need to find a counterexample to this statement.
  -- Let's try a = 2, b = 2. This is clearly a case where both numbers are even.
  -- If the statement were true, then we would have 8 ∣ 2^2 + 2^2 = 8.
  -- This would mean that 8 ∣ 8, which is true, but the converse implication doesn't hold.
  -- We can use this to show that the original statement is false.
