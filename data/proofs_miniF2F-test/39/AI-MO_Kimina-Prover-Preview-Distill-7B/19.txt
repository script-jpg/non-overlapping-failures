-- We need to show that the statement is false.
  -- So we need to find a counterexample.
  -- Let's think about it.
  -- If a and b are both even, then a = 2i and b = 2j for some integers i and j.
  -- So a^2 + b^2 = (2i)^2 + (2j)^2 = 4i^2 + 4j^2 = 4(i^2 + j^2).
  -- For this to be divisible by 8, i^2 + j^2 would need to be even.
  -- But if i and j are both even or both odd, then i^2 + j^2 is even; if one is even and the other is odd, i^2 + j^2 is odd.
  -- So let's try a = 2, b = 2: 2^2 + 2^2 = 4 + 4 = 8, which is divisible by 8.
  -- How about a = 2, b = 4: 2^2 + 4^2 = 4 + 16 = 20, which is not divisible by 8.
  -- So we found a counterexample: a = 2, b = 4.
  -- In this case, a = 2 * 1, b = 2 * 2, but 2^2 + 4^2 = 20 = 8 * 2 + 4, not divisible by 8.
  -- So the statement is false.

  -- We need to formalize this in Lean 4.
  -- We need to:
  -- 1. Set up the theorem statement
  -- 2. Find a counterexample
  -- 3. Prove that it's a counterexample

  -- The theorem statement is already given.
  -- We need to prove that it is not true that for all integers a, b, they are both even if and only if 8 divides a^2 + b^2.

  -- To prove this is false, we need to find a counterexample.
  -- In Lean 4, we can use `intro h` to assume the statement is true, and then derive a contradiction.
  intro h
  -- Now we have `h : ∀ a b : ℤ, (∃ i j, a = 2 * i ∧ b = 2 * j) ↔ ∃ k, a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 = 8 * k`
  -- We need to find a counterexample.
  -- Let's use a = 2, b = 4
  specialize h 2 4
  -- Now we have `h : (∃ i j, 2 = 2 * i ∧ 4 = 2 * j) ↔ ∃ k, 2 ^ 2 + 4 ^ 2 = 8 * k`
  -- The left side is true: 2 = 2 * 1, 4 = 2 * 2
  have h1 : ∃ i j, 2 = 2 * i ∧ 4 = 2 * j := ⟨1, 2, by norm_num, by norm_num⟩
  -- So the left side is true, which means the right side must be true
  have h2 := h.1 h1
  -- `h2` is `∃ k, 2 ^ 2 + 4 ^ 2 = 8 * k`
  -- But 2^2 + 4^2 = 4 + 16 = 20
  -- And 20 is not divisible by 8
  -- So we have a contradiction
  rcases h2 with ⟨k, hk⟩
  -- Now we have `2^2 + 4^2 = 8 * k`
  -- Let's compute 2^2 + 4^2 = 4 + 16 = 20
  -- So 20 = 8 * k
  -- But 20 is not divisible by 8
  have : 2 ^ 2 + 4 ^ 2 = 8 * k := hk
  norm_num at this
  -- Now we have `20 = 8 * k`
  -- But 20 is not divisible by 8, so this is a contradiction
