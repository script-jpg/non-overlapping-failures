-- We need to find a counterexample to this statement.
  -- To show that the statement is false, we need to find integers $a$ and $b$ such that
  -- $a$ and $b$ are both even, but $8 \nmid a^2 + b^2$.
  -- Alternatively, we can find integers $a$ and $b$ such that $8 \mid a^2 + b^2$, but $a$ and $b$ are both odd.

  -- Let's try $a = 2$ and $b = 2$.
  -- $a$ and $b$ are both even, but $2^2 + 2^2 = 4 + 4 = 8$, and $8 \mid 8$.
  -- So this example does not work.

  -- How about $a = 2$ and $b = 4$?
  -- $a$ and $b$ are both even, and $2^2 + 4^2 = 4 + 16 = 20$, but $8 \nmid 20$.
  -- This is a counterexample to the statement!

  -- Let's complete the proof by providing this counterexample.
