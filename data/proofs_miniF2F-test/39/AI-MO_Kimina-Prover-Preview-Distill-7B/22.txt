-- We need to show that the statement is false.
  -- That is, there exists some a, b which are both even such that 8 ∤ a^2 + b^2
  -- Or there exists a, b where 8 ∣ a^2 + b^2 but not both even.

  -- We give a counterexample: 2, 2.
  -- Both even, so existential statement false.
  -- counterexample: a = 2, b = 2.

  -- Because, 2^2 + 2^2 = 4 + 4 = 8, which is divisible by 8.
  -- So in this case, the bidirectional implication is of the form true → false
  -- which is false.

  -- So it is not true that for all a, b, the statement holds.
