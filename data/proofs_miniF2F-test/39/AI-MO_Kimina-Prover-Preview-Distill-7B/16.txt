-- We need to find a counterexample to this statement.
  -- Let's try a = 2, b = 2. Then a^2 + b^2 = 4 + 4 = 8. So k = 1.
  -- But a = 2, b = 2 cannot be written in the form 2 * i, 2 * j where i, j are integers.
  -- Because if a = 2 * i, then i = 1, but b = 2 * j, j = 1, but then b = 2, which is consistent.
  -- So this isn't a counterexample.
  -- Let's try a = 2, b = 4. Then a^2 + b^2 = 4 + 16 = 20. But 20 is not divisible by 8.
  -- So this is a counterexample!
  -- Let's formalize this in Lean:

  -- We need to prove the negation of the original statement.
  intro h
  specialize h 2 4
  -- Now we have: (a = 2 * i ∧ b = 2 * j) ↔ ∃ k, a^2 + b^2 = 8 * k
  -- (2 = 2 * i ∧ 4 = 2 * j) ↔ ∃ k, 2^2 + 4^2 = 8 * k
  -- (True) ↔ ∃ k, 4 + 16 = 8 * k
  -- (True) ↔ ∃ k, 20 = 8 * k
  -- The left side is true, but the right side is false for all k.
  -- So we have a contradiction.
