-- We need to show that the statement is false. To do this, we need to find a counterexample where $a$ and $b$ are both even, but $8 \nmid a^2 + b^2$.

  -- Let's think about this. If $a$ and $b$ are both even, then $a = 2i$ and $b = 2j$ for some integers $i$ and $j$.
  -- So $a^2 + b^2 = (2i)^2 + (2j)^2 = 4i^2 + 4j^2 = 4(i^2 + j^2)$.
  -- For $8 \mid a^2 + b^2$, we need $8 \mid 4(i^2 + j^2)$, which means $2 \mid i^2 + j^2$.

  -- Let's try to find a counterexample. If we take $i = 1$ and $j = 1$, then $a = 2 \cdot 1 = 2$ and $b = 2 \cdot 1 = 2$.
  -- So $a^2 + b^2 = 2^2 + 2^2 = 4 + 4 = 8$.
  -- Here, $8 \mid 8$, so this isn't a counterexample.

  -- Let's try $i = 1$ and $j = 2$. Then $a = 2 \cdot 1 = 2$ and $b = 2 \cdot 2 = 4$.
  -- So $a^2 + b^2 = 2^2 + 4^2 = 4 + 16 = 20$.
  -- Here, $8 \nmid 20$, which is a problem.

  -- So we have a counterexample: $a = 2$ and $b = 4$ (or $a = 2$ and $b = 4$).
  -- Let's formalize this in Lean:

  intro h
  specialize h 2 4
  simp at h
  norm_num at h
