-- We need to show that the statement is false
  -- Forward direction is true: if a and b are both even, then 8 divides a^2 + b^2
  -- Backward direction is false: 8 dividing a^2 + b^2 does not imply both a and b are even

  -- To prove this, we find a counterexample: a=2, b=2
  -- a and b are both even, but 8 does not divide a^2 + b^2 = 8
  -- This is a contradiction

  -- Thus, the statement is false
