-- We need to find a counterexample to this statement.
  -- We can try a = 2 and b = 2, which are both even.
  -- If the statement is false, there should exist a counterexample with a^2 + b^2 not divisible by 8.
  -- But for a = 2 and b = 2, a^2 + b^2 = 4 + 4 = 8, which is divisible by 8.
  -- Let's try another example: a = 2 and b = 4.
  -- For a = 2 and b = 4, a^2 + b^2 = 4 + 16 = 20, which is not divisible by 8.
  -- This could be a counterexample!

  -- Now we need to formalize the proof by providing a counterexample.
