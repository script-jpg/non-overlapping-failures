-- Let $a$ and $b$ be two integer numbers. Show that the following statement is false: $a$ and $b$ are both even iff $8 \mid a^2 + b^2$.

  -- We need to find a counterexample to this statement. 

  -- To this end, we consider $a = 2$ and $b = 2$.

  -- $a$ and $b$ are both even, but $8 \nmid a^2 + b^2 = 2^2 + 2^2 = 4 + 4 = 8$.

  -- This is a contradiction.
