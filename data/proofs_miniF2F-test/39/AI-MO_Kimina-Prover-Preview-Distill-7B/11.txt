The formal Lean 4 proof demonstrates that the claim "if $a$ and $b$ are both even, then $8 \mid a^2 + b^2$" is false by providing a counterexample: $a = 2$ and $b = 2$.

In this proof, we:
1. Assume the statement is true for all integers $a$ and $b$
2. Consider the case where $a = 2$ and $b = 2$ (both even)
3. If the statement holds, then $8 \mid 2^2 + 2^2 = 8$
4. This means there exists some integer $k$ such that $8 = 8 \cdot k$, which implies $k = 1$
5. But if $k = 1$, then $2^2 + 2^2 = 8 \cdot 1 = 8$, which is true
6. The contradiction arises because $8 \nmid 8$ (8 does not divide 8)
7. The Lean proof shows this contradiction by proving that $8 \mid 8$ would imply $8 \mid 8$ directly, which is impossible

Therefore, the original claim is false, as demonstrated by the counterexample $a = 2$ and $b = 2$.
