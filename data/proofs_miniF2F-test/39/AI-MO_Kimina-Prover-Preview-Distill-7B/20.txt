-- We need to show that the statement is false
  -- To do this, we need to find a counterexample where $a$ and $b$ are both even, but $8 \nmid a^2 + b^2$

  -- Let's think about this. If $a$ and $b$ are both even, then $a = 2i$ and $b = 2j$ for some integers $i$ and $j$
  -- So $a^2 + b^2 = (2i)^2 + (2j)^2 = 4i^2 + 4j^2 = 4(i^2 + j^2)$
  -- For $8 \mid a^2 + b^2$, we need $8 \mid 4(i^2 + j^2)$, which means $2 \mid i^2 + j^2$

  -- Let's try to find a counterexample. If we take $i = 1$ and $j = 1$, then $i^2 + j^2 = 1 + 1 = 2$, which is even
  -- So this would give $a^2 + b^2 = 4 \cdot 2 = 8$, which is divisible by 8

  -- Let's try another example. If we take $i = 1$ and $j = 2$, then $i^2 + j^2 = 1 + 4 = 5$, which is odd
  -- This would give $a^2 + b^2 = 4 \cdot 5 = 20$, which is not divisible by 8

  -- So $a = 2 \cdot 1 = 2$ and $b = 2 \cdot 2 = 4$ is a counterexample

  -- We can generalize this. If $i$ and $j$ are such that $i^2 + j^2$ is odd, then $a^2 + b^2 = 4(i^2 + j^2)$ will not be divisible by 8

  -- We need to show that there exist $i$ and $j$ such that $i^2 + j^2$ is odd
  -- This is true as soon as one of $i$ and $j$ is even and the other is odd

  -- Let me complete the proof with this counterexample:
