-- We need to show that the statement is false
  -- The statement is: ∀ a b : ℤ, (∃ i j, a = 2 * i ∧ b = 2 * j) ↔ ∃ k, a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 = 8 * k
  -- We can show this by finding a counterexample

  -- Let's think about how to prove the negation of a universal statement
  -- ¬∀ x, P(x) is equivalent to (∃ x, ¬P(x))
  -- So we need to find specific values a, b : ℤ such that
  -- ¬(∃ i j, a = 2 * i ∧ b = 2 * j) ∨ ∃ k, a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 = 8 * k

  -- Let's try a = 2, b = 2
  -- Then a = 2 * 1, b = 2 * 1, so the left side is true
  -- We need to check if ∃ k, 2^2 + 2^2 = 8 * k
  -- 2^2 + 2^2 = 4 + 4 = 8
  -- 8 = 8 * 1, so k = 1 works
  -- So in this case, both sides are true, which doesn't give us a counterexample

  -- Let's try a = 2, b = 4
  -- a = 2 * 1, b = 2 * 2, so the left side is true
  -- Check if ∃ k, 2^2 + 4^2 = 8 * k
  -- 2^2 + 4^2 = 4 + 16 = 20
  -- 20 is not divisible by 8, so the right side is false
  -- This gives us a counterexample where the left side is true and the right side is false

  -- Let's formalize this in Lean:

  intro h
  specialize h 2 4
  simp at h
  norm_num at h
