-- We need to show that the statement is false
  -- To do this, we need to find a counterexample where $a$ and $b$ are both even, but $8 \nmid a^2 + b^2$
  -- Let's think of a simple case where $a = b = 2$
  -- Then $a^2 + b^2 = 2^2 + 2^2 = 4 + 4 = 8$
  -- $8 \mid 8$ is true, so this isn't a counterexample
  -- Let's try $a = 2$ and $b = 4$
  -- $a^2 + b^2 = 2^2 + 4^2 = 4 + 16 = 20$
  -- $8 \nmid 20$, this is a counterexample!
  -- Let's formalize this in Lean:

  intro h
  specialize h 2 4
  norm_num at h
  -- After norm_num, h becomes: (∃ i j, 2 = 2 * i ∧ 4 = 2 * j) ↔ ∃ k, 2 ^ 2 + 4 ^ 2 = 8 * k
  -- The left side is true (with i = 1, j = 2)
  -- The right side is false, as 4 + 16 = 20, and 8 does not divide 20
  -- So we have a counterexample, proving the statement is false
  -- The contradiction will be that the left side is true but the right side is false
  -- This makes the entire bi-implication false, as expected for a counterexample
