-- We need to show that the statement is false
  -- Forward direction (⟹): assume a and b are both even, prove ∃ k, a^2 + b^2 = 8 * k
  -- Backward direction (⟸): assume ∃ k, a^2 + b^2 = 8 * k, prove a and b are both even
  -- We can disprove the statement by finding a counterexample

  -- number theory note:
  -- a and b are both even: ∃ i j, a = 2 * i ∧ b = 2 * j
  -- a^2 = 4 * i^2, b^2 = 4 * j^2
  -- a^2 + b^2 = 4 * i^2 + 4 * j^2 = 4 * (i^2 + j^2)
  -- we can get a^2 + b^2 = 4 * m for some integer m
  -- However, in order to get a^2 + b^2 = 8 * k, we need to prove that i^2 + j^2 is even
  -- That is to say, we need to prove that if a and b are both even, then a^2 + b^2 = 8 * k for some integer k

  -- Let's try some specific numbers:
  -- a = 2, b = 2: a^2 + b^2 = 4 + 4 = 8 = 8 * 1, works
  -- a = 2, b = 4: a^2 + b^2 = 4 + 16 = 20, 20 is not divisible by 8, so it's a counterexample!

  -- Thus the statement is false

  -- Formal proof:

  -- Next, we need to formalize this in Lean 4. We can use `number_theory_2_6` as a related theorem
  -- The statement we are proving is the negative of `number_theory_2_6`
  -- In other words, we need to show that it is not true that for any integers a and b,
  -- a and b are both even if and only if there exists an integer k such that a^2 + b^2 = 8 * k

  -- We can use `^` in Lean for exponentiation, and we can use `*` for multiplication

  -- The integers in Lean are represented by `ℤ`, and we can use `Int.even` to determine if an integer is even

  -- We need to find a counterexample to the original claim

  -- Let's use `a = 2` and `b = 4` as our counterexample:
  -- a and b are both even: ∃ i j, a = 2 * i ∧ b = 2 * j
  -- 2 = 2 * 1, 4 = 2 * 2: works
  -- But a^2 + b^2 = 4 + 16 = 20, and 20 is not divisible by 8

  -- Now we need to formalize this in Lean. We can use `intro h` to assume the statement is true,
  -- and then derive a contradiction

  intro h
  specialize h 2 4
  simp at h
  norm_num at h
