-- We need to show that the statement is false
  -- If $a$ and $b$ are both even, then $a^2 + b^2$ is divisible by $8$
  -- But the converse is not true

  -- Assume the statement is true
  intro h

  -- Choose a counterexample: let $a = 2$ and $b = 2$
  specialize h 2 2

  -- We know that $2^2 + 2^2 = 4 + 4 = 8$
  -- So $8 \mid 8$, which is true
  -- But $2$ is not divisible by $4$, so $2$ is not even
  -- This is a contradiction
