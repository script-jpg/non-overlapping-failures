-- We need to find a counterexample to this statement.
  -- Let's try a = 2, b = 2. Then a^2 + b^2 = 4 + 4 = 8, which is divisible by 8.
  -- This is not a counterexample.

  -- Let's try a = 2, b = 4. Then a^2 + b^2 = 4 + 16 = 20, which is not divisible by 8.
  -- This is a counterexample!

  -- To formalize this, we use the `disprove` tactic, which takes a counterexample.
