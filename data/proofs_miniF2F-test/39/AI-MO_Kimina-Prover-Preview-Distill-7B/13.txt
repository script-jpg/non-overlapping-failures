-- We need to show that the statement "for all integers a and b, a and b are both even if and only if 8 divides a^2 + b^2" is false.

  -- Let's think about why this is false. If a and b are both even, then a = 2i and b = 2j for some integers i and j.
  -- So a^2 + b^2 = (2i)^2 + (2j)^2 = 4i^2 + 4j^2 = 4(i^2 + j^2).
  -- For 8 to divide this, we need 8 to divide 4(i^2 + j^2), which means 2 to divide (i^2 + j^2).
  -- But i^2 + j^2 could be odd (e.g., if i = 1 and j = 1, then i^2 + j^2 = 2, which is even; but if i = 1 and j = 2, then i^2 + j^2 = 5, which is odd).
  -- So it's possible for a and b to be even, but 8 not to divide a^2 + b^2.

  -- Let's provide a specific counterexample: a = 2, b = 2.
  -- Then a^2 + b^2 = 4 + 4 = 8, which is divisible by 8.
  -- But let's try a = 2, b = 4: a^2 + b^2 = 4 + 16 = 20, which is not divisible by 8.
  -- So the implication fails when a = 2, b = 4.

  -- We can formalize this as:
  intro h
  specialize h 2 4
  -- After specializing, we have: (exists i j, 2 = 2 * i ∧ 4 = 2 * j) ↔ exists k, 2^2 + 4^2 = 8 * k
  -- The left side is true (i = 1, j = 2)
  -- The right side is false, as 4 + 16 = 20 ≠ 8 * k for any integer k
  simp [Int.ofNat even_iff] at h
  -- The simp tactic will simplify the expressions, proving the left side is true and the right side is false
  -- This creates a contradiction in our context
  omega
  -- The omega tactic will detect the contradiction, as we've proven the biconditional is false
