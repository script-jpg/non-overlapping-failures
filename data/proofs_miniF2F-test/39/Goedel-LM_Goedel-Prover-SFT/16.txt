  We aim to show that the statement "For any integers \(a\) and \(b\), \(a\) and \(b\) are both even if and only if \(8 \mid a^2 + b^2\)" is false. To prove this, we will use a counterexample. Specifically, we will consider the integers \(a = 2\) and \(b = 2\). According to the statement, \(a\) and \(b\) should be even if and only if \(8 \mid a^2 + b^2\). However, we will show that this is not the case by examining the divisibility condition and the parity of \(a\) and \(b\).
