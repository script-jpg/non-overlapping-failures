  We aim to show that the statement "two integer numbers \(a\) and \(b\) are both even if and only if \(8 \mid a^2 + b^2\)" is false. To prove this, we will provide a counterexample. Specifically, we will show that for \(a = 2\) and \(b = 4\), the sum \(a^2 + b^2\) is not divisible by 8, despite \(a\) and \(b\) being even.
