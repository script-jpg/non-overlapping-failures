  We aim to show that for any integer numbers \(a\) and \(b\), the statement that both \(a\) and \(b\) are even if and only if \(8 \mid a^2 + b^2\) is false. We proceed by contradiction.
  Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that the statement is true. Then, for any integers \(a\) and \(b\), we can express \(a\) and \(b\) as \(2i\) and \(2j\) respectively, where \(i\) and \(j\) are integers. Consequently, \(a^2 + b^2 = (2i)^2 + (2j)^2 = 4i^2 + 4j^2 = 4(i^2 + j^2)\), which is clearly divisible by 8. This contradicts the assumption that \(a^2 + b^2\) is not divisible by 8 when both \(a\) and \(b\) are even. Therefore, the original statement must be false.

  -- Consider the specific case where a = 2 and b = 2.
  have h₁ := h 2 2
  -- Consider the specific case where a = 0 and b = 0.
  have h₂ := h 0 0
  -- Simplify the expressions and derive a contradiction.
