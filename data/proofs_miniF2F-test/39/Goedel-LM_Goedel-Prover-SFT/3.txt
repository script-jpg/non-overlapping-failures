  We aim to show that for any integer numbers \(a\) and \(b\), the statement "both \(a\) and \(b\) are even" is equivalent to the statement "8 divides \(a^2 + b^2\)". We proceed by contradiction.
  Assume the statement is true and let \(h\) be the corresponding function. We then consider specific values for \(a\) and \(b\) to derive a contradiction.
  1. Assume both \(a\) and \(b\) are even. Then \(a = 2i\) and \(b = 2j\) for some integers \(i\) and \(j\).
  2. Substitute these into the expression \(a^2 + b^2\):
     \[
     a^2 + b^2 = (2i)^2 + (2j)^2 = 4i^2 + 4j^2 = 4(i^2 + j^2)
     \]
  3. Since \(i^2 + j^2\) is an integer, \(4(i^2 + j^2)\) is divisible by 4.
  4. However, 8 divides \(4(i^2 + j^2)\), which implies 8 divides \(a^2 + b^2\).
  5. This contradicts the assumption that \(a^2 + b^2\) is not divisible by 8.
  Thus, our initial assumption must be false.
