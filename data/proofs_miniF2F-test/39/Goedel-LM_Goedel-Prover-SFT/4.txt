  We aim to show that the statement "two integers \(a\) and \(b\) are both even if and only if \(8 \mid a^2 + b^2\)" is false. To prove this, we will demonstrate that there exist integers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a\) and \(b\) are both even, but \(8 \nmid a^2 + b^2\).
  1. Assume the statement is true and denote it by \(h\).
  2. Apply \(h\) to the specific case where \(a = 2\) and \(b = 4\).
  3. Simplify the expression \(a^2 + b^2\) for these values.
  4. Show that the simplified expression is not divisible by 8, leading to a contradiction.

  -- Assume the statement is true and denote it by `h`.
  intro h
  -- Apply `h` to the specific case where `a = 2` and `b = 4`.
  have h₁ := h 2 4
  -- Simplify the expression `a^2 + b^2` for these values.
  simp at h₁
  -- Show that the simplified expression is not divisible by 8, leading to a contradiction.
  have h₂ := h 4 2
  simp at h₂
  have h₃ := h 6 6
  simp at h₃
  -- Use the `omega` tactic to solve the resulting arithmetic contradiction.
