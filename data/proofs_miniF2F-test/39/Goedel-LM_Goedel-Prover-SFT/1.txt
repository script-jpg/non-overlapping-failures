  We aim to show that the statement "If \(a\) and \(b\) are both even, then \(8 \mid a^2 + b^2\)" is false. To prove this, we will consider specific cases where \(a\) and \(b\) are not both even.
  1. **Case 1: \(a = 2k\) and \(b = 2l + 1\) for some integers \(k\) and \(l\).**
     - \(a^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2\)
     - \(b^2 = (2l + 1)^2 = 4l^2 + 4l + 1\)
     - \(a^2 + b^2 = 4k^2 + 4l^2 + 4l + 1 = 4(k^2 + l^2 + l) + 1\)
     - Since \(4(k^2 + l^2 + l)\) is even, \(a^2 + b^2\) is odd, which means \(8 \nmid a^2 + b^2\).
  2. **Case 2: \(a = 2k + 1\) and \(b = 2l\) for some integers \(k\) and \(l\).**
     - \(a^2 = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1\)
     - \(b^2 = (2l)^2 = 4l^2\)
     - \(a^2 + b^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 + 4l^2 = 4(k^2 + l^2 + k) + 1\)
     - Since \(4(k^2 + l^2 + k)\) is even, \(a^2 + b^2\) is odd, which means \(8 \nmid a^2 + b^2\).
  In both cases, \(a^2 + b^2\) is not divisible by 8, thus proving the original statement is false.
