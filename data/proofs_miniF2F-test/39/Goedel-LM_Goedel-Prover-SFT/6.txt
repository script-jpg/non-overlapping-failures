  We aim to show that the statement "For any integers \(a\) and \(b\), \(a\) and \(b\) are both even if and only if \(8 \mid a^2 + b^2\)" is false. To prove this, we will use the method of contradiction.
  1. Assume the statement is true and derive a contradiction.
  2. Consider the case where \(a = 2i\) and \(b = 2j\) for some integers \(i\) and \(j\).
  3. Calculate \(a^2 + b^2\) and show that it is not divisible by 8.
  4. This leads to a contradiction, proving that the original statement is false.
