  We aim to show that the statement "For any integers \(a\) and \(b\), \(a\) and \(b\) are both even if and only if \(8 \mid a^2 + b^2\)" is false. To prove this, we will use the method of counterexample. Specifically, we will demonstrate that there exist integers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a\) and \(b\) are both even, but \(8 \nmid a^2 + b^2\).
  1. Assume the statement is true and derive a contradiction.
  2. Consider the specific case where \(a = 2\) and \(b = 2\). According to the statement, \(a\) and \(b\) are both even, so there exist integers \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(a = 2i\) and \(b = 2j\).
  3. Calculate \(a^2 + b^2\) for the given values: \(2^2 + 2^2 = 4 + 4 = 8\).
  4. Since \(8 \mid a^2 + b^2\), by the assumption, there exists an integer \(k\) such that \(a^2 + b^2 = 8k\).
  5. However, \(8 \mid a^2 + b^2\) implies that \(a^2 + b^2\) is divisible by 8, but we have \(a^2 + b^2 = 8\), which is not divisible by 8.
  6. This contradiction shows that the original statement is false.
