  We aim to show that the statement "for any integers \(a\) and \(b\), \(a\) and \(b\) are both even if and only if \(8 \mid a^2 + b^2\)" is false. To prove this, we assume the statement is true and derive a contradiction.
  1. Assume the statement is true.
  2. Apply this assumption to the specific integers \(a = 2\) and \(b = 2\).
  3. Simplify the expression \(a^2 + b^2\) for these values.
  4. Show that the result is not divisible by 8, leading to a contradiction.
