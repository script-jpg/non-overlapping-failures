  We aim to show that the statement "for any integers \(a\) and \(b\), \(a\) and \(b\) are both even if and only if \(8 \mid a^2 + b^2\)" is false. To prove this, we will use the method of counterexample. Specifically, we will show that there exist integers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a\) and \(b\) are both even, but \(8\) does not divide \(a^2 + b^2\).
  1. Consider the integers \(a = 2\) and \(b = 2\).
  2. Verify that \(a\) and \(b\) are both even.
  3. Show that \(8\) does not divide \(2^2 + 2^2\).

  -- Consider the integers a = 2 and b = 4.
  have h2 := h 2 4
  -- Simplify the expressions and show that the assumptions lead to a contradiction.
