  We aim to show that the statement "for all integers \(a\) and \(b\), \(a\) and \(b\) are both even if and only if \(8 \mid a^2 + b^2\)" is false. We proceed by contradiction.
  Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that the statement is true. We then apply this assumption to the specific case where \(a = 2\) and \(b = 6\). By the assumption, \(a\) and \(b\) are both even if and only if \(8 \mid a^2 + b^2\). However, we find that \(a^2 + b^2 = 4 + 36 = 40\), which is not divisible by 8. This leads to a contradiction, as \(40\) is not divisible by 8. Therefore, the original statement must be false.
