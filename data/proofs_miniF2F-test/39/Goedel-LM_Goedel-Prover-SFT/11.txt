  We aim to show that the statement "For any integer numbers \(a\) and \(b\), \(a\) and \(b\) are both even if and only if \(8 \mid a^2 + b^2\)" is false. To prove this, we will use the following steps:
  1. Assume the statement is true and derive a contradiction.
  2. Apply the assumed statement to specific pairs of integers to find contradictions.

  -- Assume the statement is true and derive a contradiction.
  intro h
  -- Apply the assumed statement to the pair (0, 0).
  have h1 := h 0 0
  -- Apply the assumed statement to the pair (0, 2).
  have h2 := h 0 2
  -- Apply the assumed statement to the pair (2, 0).
  have h3 := h 2 0
  -- Apply the assumed statement to the pair (2, 2).
  have h4 := h 2 2
  -- Simplify the derived statements to find contradictions.
  simp at h1 h2 h3 h4
  -- Use the `omega` tactic to find a contradiction in the simplified statements.
