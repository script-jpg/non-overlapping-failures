  We aim to show that the statement "for any integer numbers \(a\) and \(b\), \(a\) and \(b\) are both even if and only if \(8 \mid a^2 + b^2\)" is false. We proceed by contradiction. Assume the statement is true and denote it by \(h\). We then consider specific values for \(a\) and \(b\) to derive a contradiction.
  1. Assume \(h\) holds for all \(a\) and \(b\).
  2. Apply \(h\) to \(a = 2\) and \(b = 2\). By the assumption, \(a\) and \(b\) are even, so there exist integers \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(a = 2i\) and \(b = 2j\).
  3. Apply \(h\) to \(a = 2\) and \(b = 0\). By the assumption, \(a\) and \(b\) are even, so there exist integers \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(a = 2i\) and \(b = 2j\).
  4. Apply \(h\) to \(a = 0\) and \(b = 2\). By the assumption, \(a\) and \(b\) are even, so there exist integers \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(a = 2i\) and \(b = 2j\).
  5. Apply \(h\) to \(a = 0\) and \(b = 0\). By the assumption, \(a\) and \(b\) are even, so there exist integers \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(a = 2i\) and \(b = 2j\).
  6. Simplify the expressions using the specific values and derive contradictions using the properties of divisibility and modular arithmetic.
