  We aim to show that the statement "for all integers \(a\) and \(b\), \(a\) and \(b\) are both even if and only if \(8 \mid a^2 + b^2\)" is false. To prove this, we will provide a counterexample where \(a\) and \(b\) are not both even, but \(8 \mid a^2 + b^2\). Specifically, we will show that for \(a = 2\) and \(b = 2\), \(a\) and \(b\) are not both even, but \(8 \mid a^2 + b^2\).

  -- Consider the specific case where a = 2 and b = 2.
  have h₁ := h 2 2
  -- Consider the specific case where a = 2 and b = 1.
  have h₂ := h 2 1
  -- Simplify the conditions and check the divisibility.
  simp at h₁ h₂
  -- Use the omega tactic to find the contradiction.
