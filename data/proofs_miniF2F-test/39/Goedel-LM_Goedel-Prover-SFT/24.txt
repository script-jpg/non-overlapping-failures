  We aim to show that the statement "for any integers \(a\) and \(b\), \(a\) and \(b\) are both even if and only if \(8 \mid a^2 + b^2\)". We proceed by contradiction. Assume the statement is true. Then, for any integers \(a\) and \(b\), \(a\) and \(b\) are both even if and only if \(8 \mid a^2 + b^2\). We will show that this leads to a contradiction.
  1. Assume \(a\) and \(b\) are both even. Then there exist integers \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(a = 2i\) and \(b = 2j\).
  2. We need to show that \(8 \mid a^2 + b^2\). Substituting \(a = 2i\) and \(b = 2j\), we get \(a^2 + b^2 = (2i)^2 + (2j)^2 = 4i^2 + 4j^2 = 4(i^2 + j^2)\).
  3. Since \(i^2 + j^2\) is an integer, \(4(i^2 + j^2)\) is divisible by 4.
  4. To show \(8 \mid a^2 + b^2\), we need \(4(i^2 + j^2)\) to be divisible by 8. This implies \(i^2 + j^2\) must be divisible by 2, which is not necessarily true.
  5. Therefore, \(8 \mid a^2 + b^2\) is not always true, leading to a contradiction.
  Thus, the statement "for any integers \(a\) and \(b\), \(a\) and \(b\) are both even if and only if \(8 \mid a^2 + b^2\)" is false.
