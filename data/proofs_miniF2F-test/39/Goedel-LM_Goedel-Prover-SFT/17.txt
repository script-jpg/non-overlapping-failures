  We aim to show that for any integers \(a\) and \(b\), the statement "both \(a\) and \(b\) are even" is equivalent to "8 divides \(a^2 + b^2\)". The proof proceeds by contradiction.
  1. Assume the negation of the statement, i.e., there exist integers \(a\) and \(b\) such that the equivalence does not hold.
  2. Consider the specific case where \(a = 4\) and \(b = 0\).
  3. Verify that \(a\) and \(b\) are even, but \(8\) does not divide \(a^2 + b^2\).
  4. This leads to a contradiction, confirming the original statement.
