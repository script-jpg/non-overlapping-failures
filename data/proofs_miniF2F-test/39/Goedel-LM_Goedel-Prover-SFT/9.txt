  We aim to show that the statement "For any integers \(a\) and \(b\), \(a\) and \(b\) are both even if and only if \(8 \mid a^2 + b^2\)" is false. To prove this, we will use a counterexample. Specifically, we will show that for \(a = 2\) and \(b = 6\), the statement does not hold.
  1. Assume the statement is true and let \(k\) be the integer such that \(a^2 + b^2 = 8k\).
  2. For \(a = 2\) and \(b = 6\), we calculate \(a^2 + b^2 = 2^2 + 6^2 = 4 + 36 = 40\).
  3. We need \(40 = 8k\) for some integer \(k\). However, \(40 \div 8 = 5\) but \(5\) is not an integer, leading to a contradiction.
  4. Therefore, the original statement must be false.
