  We aim to show that for any integers \(a\) and \(b\), the statement "both \(a\) and \(b\) are even" is equivalent to the statement "there exists an integer \(k\) such that \(a^2 + b^2 = 8k\)".
  1. **Definition of Evenness**: A number \(n\) is even if there exists an integer \(m\) such that \(n = 2m\).
  2. **Statement of Evenness**: For \(a\) and \(b\), the statement "both \(a\) and \(b\) are even" can be rewritten as the existence of integers \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(a = 2i\) and \(b = 2j\).
  3. **Equivalence**: We need to show that the existence of such \(i\) and \(j\) is equivalent to the existence of an integer \(k\) such that \(a^2 + b^2 = 8k\).
  4. **Proof of Equivalence**:
     - If \(a = 2i\) and \(b = 2j\), then \(a^2 + b^2 = (2i)^2 + (2j)^2 = 4i^2 + 4j^2 = 4(i^2 + j^2)\). Since \(i^2 + j^2\) is an integer, \(a^2 + b^2 = 4(i^2 + j^2)\) is divisible by 4.
     - Conversely, if \(a^2 + b^2 = 8k\), then \(a^2 + b^2 = 8k\) implies that \(a^2 + b^2\) is divisible by 8. For \(a^2 + b^2\) to be divisible by 8, both \(a\) and \(b\) must be even (since the square of an odd number is not divisible by 8).
  Thus, the statement "both \(a\) and \(b\) are even" is equivalent to the statement "there exists an integer \(k\) such that \(a^2 + b^2 = 8k\)".
