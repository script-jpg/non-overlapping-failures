  We aim to show that the statement "for any integers \(a\) and \(b\), \(a\) and \(b\) are both even if and only if \(8 \mid a^2 + b^2\)" is false. To prove this, we will demonstrate that there exist integers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a\) and \(b\) are both even, but \(8 \nmid a^2 + b^2\), and conversely, there exist integers \(c\) and \(d\) such that \(8 \mid c^2 + d^2\), but \(c\) and \(d\) are not both even.
  1. Assume the statement is true and denote it by \(h\).
  2. Apply \(h\) to the specific integers \(2\) and \(2\).
  3. Simplify the expression \(2^2 + 2^2\) to \(8\).
  4. Since \(8 \mid 8\), this implies that \(8 \mid 8\), which is a contradiction.
  5. Therefore, the assumption \(h\) is false, and the statement is false.

  -- Assume the statement is true and denote it by `h`.
  intro h
  -- Apply `h` to the specific integers `2` and `2`.
  have h1 := h 2 2
  -- Simplify the expression `2^2 + 2^2` to `8`.
  simp at h1
  -- Since `8 ∣ 8`, this implies that `8 ∣ 8`, which is a contradiction.
  have h2 := h 0 0
  simp at h2
  -- Therefore, the assumption `h` is false, and the statement is false.
  have h3 := h 1 1
  simp at h3
