  We aim to show that the statement "For any integer numbers \(a\) and \(b\), \(a\) and \(b\) are both even if and only if \(8 \mid a^2 + b^2\)" is false. To prove this, we will use specific values of \(a\) and \(b\) to demonstrate that the statement does not hold universally.
  1. Assume the statement is true and derive a contradiction.
  2. Consider the values \(a = 2\) and \(b = 2\). According to the statement, \(a\) and \(b\) are both even if and only if \(8 \mid a^2 + b^2\).
  3. Calculate \(a^2 + b^2\) for these values: \(2^2 + 2^2 = 4 + 4 = 8\).
  4. Since \(8 \mid 8\) is true, the statement holds for \(a = 2\) and \(b = 2\).
  5. However, consider the values \(a = 2\) and \(b = 1\). According to the statement, \(a\) and \(b\) are both even if and only if \(8 \mid a^2 + b^2\).
  6. Calculate \(a^2 + b^2\) for these values: \(2^2 + 1^2 = 4 + 1 = 5\).
  7. Since \(5 \not\mid 8\) is false, the statement does not hold for these values.
  8. Therefore, the original statement is false.
