intro h
  specialize h 2 4
  -- We choose a = 2 and b = 4, both even numbers.
  have h₁ := h
  simp at h₁
  -- Simplify the statement to check the equivalence.
  obtain ⟨k, hk⟩ := h₁
  -- Use the simplified statement to find a contradiction.
  have h₂ := hk
  ring_nf at h₂
  -- Normalize the equation to find a contradiction.
