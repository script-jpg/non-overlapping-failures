  To solve the problem, we need to determine how many marbles to remove from a total of 239 + 174 + 83 marbles to start the game. The game involves arranging marbles into piles of 10, so we need to find the remainder when the total number of marbles is divided by 10.
  First, we calculate the total number of marbles:
  \[ 239 + 174 + 83 = 496 \]
  Next, we find the remainder of 496 when divided by 10:
  \[ 496 \div 10 = 49 \text{ remainder } 6 \]
  Thus, the remainder is 6, which means 6 marbles must be removed to start the game.
