  To determine how many marbles must be removed to start the game, we need to find the remainder when the total number of marbles is divided by 10. Given that Sally brought 239 marbles, Wei-Hwa brought 174 marbles, and Zoe brought 83 marbles, we calculate the total number of marbles as follows:
  \[ 239 + 174 + 83 = 496 \]
  Next, we find the remainder when 496 is divided by 10:
  \[ 496 \mod 10 = 6 \]
  Thus, Sally, Wei-Hwa, and Zoe must remove 6 marbles to start the game.
