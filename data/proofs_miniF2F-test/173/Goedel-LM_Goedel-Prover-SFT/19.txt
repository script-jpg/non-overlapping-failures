  To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of marbles that need to be removed to start the game. We are given the number of marbles each person brought: Sally brought 239 marbles, Wei-Hwa brought 174 marbles, and Zoe brought 83 marbles. The total number of marbles is \(239 + 174 + 83 = 496\). We need to find the remainder when 496 is divided by 10.
  First, we calculate the sum of the marbles:
  \[ 239 + 174 + 83 = 496 \]
  Next, we find the remainder of 496 when divided by 10:
  \[ 496 \div 10 = 49 \text{ remainder } 6 \]
  Thus, the remainder is 6, which means 6 marbles need to be removed to start the game.
