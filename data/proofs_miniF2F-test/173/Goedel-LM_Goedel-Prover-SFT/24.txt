  To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of marbles that must be removed to start the game. Given that Sally brought 239 marbles, Wei-Hwa brought 174 marbles, and Zoe brought 83 marbles, we need to find the number of marbles that must be removed to ensure that all piles have exactly 10 marbles.
  First, we calculate the total number of marbles:
  \[ 239 + 174 + 83 = 496 \]
  Next, we determine the number of marbles that need to be removed to make the total number of marbles a multiple of 10. We start by calculating the remainder when 496 is divided by 10:
  \[ 496 \div 10 = 49 \text{ remainder } 6 \]
  Thus, the number of marbles that need to be removed is 6.
