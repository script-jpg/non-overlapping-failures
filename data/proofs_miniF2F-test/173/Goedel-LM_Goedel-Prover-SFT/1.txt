  To determine how many marbles must be removed to start the game, we need to find the remainder when the total number of marbles is divided by 10. The total number of marbles is the sum of the marbles brought by Sally, Wei-Hwa, and Zoe. Given that Sally brought 239 marbles, Wei-Hwa brought 174 marbles, and Zoe brought 83 marbles, the total number of marbles is \(239 + 174 + 83\).
  First, we calculate the sum of these numbers:
  \[ 239 + 174 + 83 = 496 \]
  Next, we find the remainder when 496 is divided by 10:
  \[ 496 \div 10 = 49 \text{ remainder } 6 \]
  Thus, the remainder is 6. Therefore, 6 marbles must be removed to start the game.
