  To solve the problem, we need to determine how many marbles must be removed to start the game. Given that Sally brought 239 marbles, Wei-Hwa brought 174 marbles, and Zoe brought 83 marbles, we need to find the total number of marbles and then determine how many marbles must be removed to make the total a multiple of 10.
  First, we calculate the total number of marbles:
  \[ 239 + 174 + 83 = 496 \]
  Next, we determine how many marbles must be removed to make 496 a multiple of 10:
  \[ 496 \div 10 = 49.6 \]
  Since 496 is not divisible by 10, we need to find the remainder when 496 is divided by 10. This is done by summing the digits of 496:
  \[ 4 + 9 + 6 = 19 \]
  Finally, we find the remainder of 19 when divided by 10:
  \[ 19 \mod 10 = 9 \]
  Thus, 9 marbles must be removed to make the total 496 a multiple of 10.
