  To determine the number of marbles that need to be removed to start the game, we need to find the remainder when the total number of marbles is divided by 10. The total number of marbles is the sum of Sally's, Wei-Hwa's, and Zoe's marbles. We are given:
  - Sally brought 239 marbles.
  - Wei-Hwa brought 174 marbles.
  - Zoe brought 83 marbles.
  First, we calculate the total number of marbles:
  \[ 239 + 174 + 83 = 506 \]
  Next, we find the remainder when 506 is divided by 10:
  \[ 506 \div 10 = 50 \text{ remainder } 6 \]
  Thus, the remainder is 6. Therefore, 6 marbles need to be removed to start the game.

  -- We need to find the remainder when the total number of marbles is divided by 10.
  -- The total number of marbles is 239 + 174 + 83.
  -- We use the modulo operation to find the remainder.

  -- The simplification above calculates the remainder of 239 + 174 + 83 when divided by 10.
  -- The result is 6, which matches our expected result.
