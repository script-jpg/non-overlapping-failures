  To solve the problem, we need to determine how many marbles must be removed from the total number of marbles (239 + 174 + 83) to start the game. The total number of marbles is 496. To start the game, we need to reduce the total modulo 10. Since 496 modulo 10 is 6, we conclude that 6 marbles must be removed.

  -- Calculate the total number of marbles
  have h₀ : 239 + 174 + 83 = 496 := by norm_num
  -- Calculate the remainder when 496 is divided by 10
  have h₁ : 496 % 10 = 6 := by norm_num
  -- Since 496 modulo 10 is 6, we conclude that 6 marbles must be removed
