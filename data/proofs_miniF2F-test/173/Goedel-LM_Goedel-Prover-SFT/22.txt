  To determine how many marbles must be removed to start the game, we need to find the remainder when the total number of marbles is divided by 10. The total number of marbles is given by the sum of the marbles brought by Sally, Wei-Hwa, and Zoe: 239, 174, and 83. We calculate the sum of these numbers and then find its remainder when divided by 10.
  First, we compute the sum of the marbles:
  \[ 239 + 174 + 83 = 506 \]
  Next, we find the remainder of 506 when divided by 10:
  \[ 506 \div 10 = 50 \text{ remainder } 6 \]
  Thus, the remainder is 6. Therefore, to start the game, 6 marbles must be removed.
