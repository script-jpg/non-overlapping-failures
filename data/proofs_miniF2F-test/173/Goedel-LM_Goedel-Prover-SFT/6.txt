  To solve the problem, we need to determine the remainder when the total number of marbles is divided by 10. Given that Sally brought 239 marbles, Wei-Hwa brought 174 marbles, and Zoe brought 83 marbles, we can calculate the total number of marbles by summing these values. The sum is \(239 + 174 + 83 = 506\). We then find the remainder of 506 when divided by 10.
  First, we perform the addition:
  \[ 239 + 174 = 413 \]
  \[ 413 + 83 = 506 \]
  Next, we find the remainder of 506 when divided by 10:
  \[ 506 \div 10 = 50 \text{ remainder } 6 \]
  Thus, the remainder is 6. Therefore, the number of marbles that must be removed to start the game is 6.
