  To determine the number of marbles that must be removed to start the game, we first calculate the total number of marbles brought by Sally, Wei-Hwa, and Zoe. Given that Sally brought 239 marbles, Wei-Hwa brought 174 marbles, and Zoe brought 83 marbles, we sum these numbers:
  \[ 239 + 174 + 83 = 496 \]
  Next, we need to find the remainder when 496 is divided by 10. This can be done using modular arithmetic:
  \[ 496 \mod 10 \]
  Performing the division, we get:
  \[ 496 \div 10 = 49 \text{ remainder } 6 \]
  Thus, the remainder is 6, which means that 6 marbles must be removed to start the game.
