-- We need to find the total number of marbles modulo 10.
  calc (239 + 174 + 83) % 10
      -- Calculate the sum of the marbles: 239 + 174 + 83 = 496
      _ = 496 % 10
      -- Calculate 496 modulo 10, which is 6
      _ = 6

  -- Therefore, 6 marbles must be removed to start the game.
```

In this problem, we calculated the total number of marbles and found that 6 marbles must be removed to group them into piles of 10. This is a straightforward application of modular arithmetic, where we calculate the remainder when dividing by 10. The Lean proof demonstrates this calculation formally.

/- Sally, Wei-Hwa, and Zoe are playing a game of marbles involving first arranging as many piles of 10 marbles as possible.  Sally brought 239 marbles, Wei-Hwa brought 174 marbles, and Zoe brought 83 marbles.  If all their marbles are grouped together, how many must be removed in order to start the game? Show that it is 6.-/
