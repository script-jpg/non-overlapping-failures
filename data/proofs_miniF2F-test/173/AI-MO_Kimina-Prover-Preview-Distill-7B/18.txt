-- We need to find the number of marbles that need to be removed so that the remaining marbles can be grouped into piles of 10.

  -- Then, we need to find the remainder when dividing by 10, as this will tell us how many marbles are left over after making as many piles of 10 as possible.

  -- We can calculate this remainder by first determining how many complete piles of 10 marbles can be made.
  let complete_piles := total_marbles / 10
