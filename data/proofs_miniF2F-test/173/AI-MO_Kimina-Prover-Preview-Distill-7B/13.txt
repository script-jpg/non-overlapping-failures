In this problem, we need to determine how many marbles must be removed so that the remaining marbles can be grouped into piles of 10. 

First, let's calculate the total number of marbles:
- Sally has 239 marbles
- Wei-Hwa has 174 marbles
- Zoe has 83 marbles

Adding these together: 239 + 174 + 83 = 496 marbles in total.

To find out how many marbles need to be removed, we need to find 496 modulo 10. The remainder when 496 is divided by 10 is 6, since 496 = 49 * 10 + 6. 

Therefore, 6 marbles must be removed so that the remaining 490 marbles can be grouped into 49 piles of 10 marbles each.

In Lean 4, we would prove this as follows:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

Now we need to state the theorem. We want to prove that when we add up all the marbles and take the remainder modulo 10, we get 6.

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_254 : (239 + 174 + 83) % 10 = 6 := by
```

Now we need to prove that (239 + 174 + 83) % 10 = 6. Let's compute directly:
239 + 174 + 83 = 496
496 % 10 = 6

In Lean, we can prove this by direct computation using the `norm_num` tactic, which is powerful for solving arithmetic goals:

```tactics
norm_num
```

The `norm_num` tactic is able to compute arithmetic expressions and verify equalities between concrete numbers. In this case, it computes (239 + 174 + 83) % 10, which is 496 % 10, and confirms that it equals 6. This completes our proof.

Therefore, the number of marbles that must be removed is 6.
