-- We need to find the number of marbles that need to be removed so that the remaining marbles can be grouped into piles of 10.
  -- First, let's calculate the total number of marbles.
  -- Sally has 239 marbles, Wei-Hwa has 174, and Zoe has 83.
  -- Total marbles = 239 + 174 + 83
  have h1 : 239 + 174 + 83 = 496 := by norm_num
  -- Now, we need to find 496 % 10 to determine how many marbles need to be removed.
  -- 496 divided by 10 is 49 with a remainder of 6.
  -- Therefore, 496 % 10 = 6
  have h2 : 496 % 10 = 6 := by norm_num
  -- Substituting the value, we get the final answer.
  rw [h1, h2]
