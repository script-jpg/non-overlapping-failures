-- We need to find the number of marbles that must be removed so that the remaining marbles can be grouped into piles of 10.
  -- The total number of marbles is 239 + 174 + 83.
  -- We need to calculate (239 + 174 + 83) % 10 to find the remainder when divided by 10.
  -- The remainder is the number of marbles that must be removed.
  -- Let's calculate:
  -- 239 + 174 + 83 = 496
  -- 496 % 10 = 6
  -- Therefore, 6 marbles must be removed.
