-- We need to find the number of marbles that need to be removed so that the remaining marbles can be grouped into piles of 10.
  -- First, let's calculate the total number of marbles.
  have h1 : 239 + 174 + 83 = 496 := by norm_num
  rw [h1]
  -- Now we need to find 496 % 10, which is the remainder when 496 is divided by 10.
  -- To find this, we can calculate how many complete piles of 10 can be made from 496 marbles.
  have h2 : 496 ÷ 10 = 49 := by norm_num
  have h3 : 496 - 10 * 49 = 6 := by norm_num
  -- The remainder is 6, which means 6 marbles need to be removed to make 49 complete piles of 10.
