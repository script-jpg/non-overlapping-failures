-- We need to find the number of marbles that need to be removed so that the remaining marbles can be grouped into piles of 10.
  -- First, let's calculate the total number of marbles.
  have h1 : 239 + 174 + 83 = 496 := by norm_num
  -- Now, to find the number of marbles that need to be removed, we calculate the remainder when 496 is divided by 10.
  have h2 : 496 % 10 = 6 := by norm_num
  -- Therefore, 6 marbles need to be removed.
  rw [h1, h2]
