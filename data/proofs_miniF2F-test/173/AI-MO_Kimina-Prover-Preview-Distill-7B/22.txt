The key insight is that we need to find the remainder when the sum of all marbles is divided by 10. This is because we want to arrange as many piles of 10 marbles as possible, and the remainder will tell us how many marbles are left over that cannot be grouped into complete piles.

Let's calculate this step by step:

1. First, we add up all the marbles: 239 (Sally's) + 174 (Wei-Hwa's) + 83 (Zoe's).
   - 239 + 174 = 413
   - 413 + 83 = 496

2. Now we need to find the remainder when 496 is divided by 10. This is equivalent to finding 496 mod 10.

3. To compute 496 mod 10, we look at the last digit of 496, which is 6. This is because the remainder when dividing by 10 is simply the last digit of the number.

Therefore, 496 mod 10 = 6.

This means we need to remove 6 marbles from the total so that the remaining marbles can be grouped into complete piles of 10.

The Lean proof is remarkably simple because it's a direct computation:

We've imported the necessary libraries and opened namespaces to access mathematical definitions and lemmas.

Now, let's look at the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_254 : (239 + 174 + 83) % 10 = 6 := by 
```

The theorem states that when we sum the marbles brought by Sally, Wei-Hwa, and Zoe, and then take the remainder when dividing by 10, the result is 6. This directly corresponds to the number of marbles that must be removed to start the game.

To complete the proof, we simply use the `rfl` tactic, which stands for "reflexivity":

```tactics
rfl
```

The `rfl` tactic proves that the left and right sides of the equation are definitionally equal. In this case, Lean can compute the arithmetic expression `(239 + 174 + 83) % 10` and verify that it equals 6.

So the complete proof is:
- Calculate the total number of marbles: 239 + 174 + 83 = 496
- Find the remainder when 496 is divided by 10 (i.e., 496 mod 10)
- The remainder is the last digit of 496, which is 6
- Therefore, we need to remove 6 marbles to start the game

The Lean proof confirms that indeed, (239 + 174 + 83) % 10 = 6, which is the answer to the problem.
