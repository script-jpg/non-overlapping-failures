This Lean 4 proof is quite straightforward. We need to show that when all the marbles are grouped together, 6 marbles must be removed so that the remaining marbles can be arranged into piles of 10. 

First, we calculate the total number of marbles: 
- Sally brought 239 marbles
- Wei-Hwa brought 174 marbles
- Zoe brought 83 marbles

Adding these together: 239 + 174 + 83 = 496 marbles

To determine how many marbles need to be removed, we find the remainder when 496 is divided by 10. This is because we want to form as many piles of 10 marbles as possible, and the remainder will be the number of marbles that cannot be grouped into complete piles of 10.

Performing the division: 496 ÷ 10 = 49 with a remainder of 6.

Therefore, 6 marbles must be removed, leaving 490 marbles, which can be arranged into 49 piles of 10 marbles each.

In Lean, we express this as `(239 + 174 + 83) % 10 = 6`, which is exactly what the theorem states. The `norm_num` tactic is able to compute this arithmetic expression directly:
1. It calculates 239 + 174 + 83 = 496
2. It computes 496 % 10 = 6 
3. It verifies that 6 = 6

This completes our proof that 6 marbles must be removed, which is the answer to the original problem.
