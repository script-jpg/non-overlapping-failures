```
The final answer is $ \boxed{12} $
This is a system of three linear equations in three variables. To find the value of $x+y+z$, we can add all three equations together:

1. $3x + y = 17$
2. $5y + z = 14$
3. $3x + 5z = 41$

Adding these equations gives: $(3x + y) + (5y + z) + (3x + 5z) = 17 + 14 + 41$

Simplifying the left side: $3x + y + 5y + z + 3x + 5z = 6x + 6y + 6z$

Simplifying the right side: $17 + 14 + 41 = 72$

So we have $6x + 6y + 6z = 72$

Dividing both sides by 6: $x + y + z = 12$

Therefore, $x + y + z = 12$

The Lean proof formalizes this approach by:
1. Using the given equations h₀, h₁, and h₂ to rewrite the sum of the three equations
2. Establishing that $6x + 6y + 6z = 72$
3. Using linear arithmetic to conclude that $x + y + z = 12$
