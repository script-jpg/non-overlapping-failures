-- Given the equations $3x+y=17,5y+z=14$ and $3x+5z=41$, what is the value of the sum $x+y+z$? Show that it is 12.-/
  --/-- To find the value of $x + y + z$, we can add all three equations together. -/
  have h : 3 * x + y + (5 * y + z) + (3 * x + 5 * z) = 17 + 14 + 41 := by
    rw [h₀, h₁, h₂]
  -- Simplifying the left side: $3x + y + 5y + z + 3x + 5z = 6x + 6y + 6z$
  have h' : 6 * x + 6 * y + 6 * z = 72 := by linarith
  -- Dividing both sides by 6: $x + y + z = 12$
