The above is the entire proof, and it gives the wrong answer! What's the problem?

The fundamental problem is that once we start working with real numbers, we begin to lose the ability to make certain kinds of logical deductions that we take for granted when working with integers. The above proof is an example of this phenomenon: it appears to be a valid proof, but it arrives at the wrong answer.

The problem becomes apparent if we think about what the real number system is supposed to represent. The real numbers are an extension of the integers, in which all the standard algebraic properties are maintained, but there is a fundamental loss: the ability to make certain kinds of logical deductions that hold for integers but not for real numbers.

In this case, the problem is that the real numbers are a dense set. This means that for any two distinct real numbers $a$ and $b$, there exists another real number $c$ that lies between them (e.g., $c=\frac{a+b}{2}$). This property is known as the "density" of the real numbers, and it means that there is always some kind of " proximity" between any two distinct real numbers.

Now, in our proof, we added all three equations:
$3x+y=17$
$5y+z=14$
$3x+5z=41$

Adding them together gives $6x+6y+6z=120$, and dividing by 6 gives $x+y+z=20$.

But this is incorrect! The problem is that when we add equations, we have to be careful about what exactly we're proving. In this case, the problem is that the real numbers are too "dense" for our deductions to hold.

To see why this is a problem, consider the following:
- From $3x+y=17$, we know that $y=17-3x$.
- From $5y+z=14$, we know that $z=14-5y=14-5(17-3x)=14-85+15x=-71+15x$.
- Substituting $y=17-3x$ and $z=-71+15x$ into $x+y+z$, we get: $x+(17-3x)+(-71+15x)=x+17-3x-71+15x=12x-54$.

Now, if we substitute $x=6$ (which is the answer given by the incorrect method), we get $12(6)-54=72-54=18$, which is not equal to 12.

The problem is that the answer should be $x=6$ and $z=-71+15x=-71+15(6)=-71+90=19$, so $x+y+z=6+17+19=42$, which is not equal to 12.

In fact, the system of equations is inconsistent, and there is no solution that satisfies all three equations simultaneously. The answer $\boxed{12}$ is incorrect because no such $x$, $y$, and $z$ exist.

The error becomes apparent when we think about the physical interpretation of these equations. If we consider $x$, $y$, and $z$ to be physical quantities with units, then the left-hand sides of the equations have different units from the right-hand sides. This makes the equations dimensionally inconsistent, and hence they cannot be solved.

In conclusion, while the problem appears to have a solution of $x+y+z=12$, this is actually incorrect because the system of equations is inconsistent and has no solution. The error arises from the fundamental differences between the integer and real number systems, particularly regarding the properties of "ordering" and "closeness" that are often taken for granted in integer-based problem solving.
