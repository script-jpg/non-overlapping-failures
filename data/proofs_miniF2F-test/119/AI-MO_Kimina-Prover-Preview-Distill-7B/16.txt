-- Given the equations $3x+y=17,5y+z=14$ and $3x+5z=41$, what is the value of the sum $x+y+z$? Show that it is 12.

  -- We need to use the given equations to find the value of x + y + z.

  -- Let's start by importing the necessary libraries and opening namespaces.

  -- Now let's define our theorem with the given equations as hypotheses.

  theorem mathd_algebra_427 (x y z : ℝ) (h₀ : 3 * x + y = 17) (h₁ : 5 * y + z = 14)
      (h₂ : 3 * x + 5 * z = 41) : x + y + z = 12 := by

  -- To find x + y + z, we could try to solve the entire system of equations, but we can also find the value of x + y + z directly by combining the given equations.

  -- If we add all three equations, we get:
  -- (3x + y) + (5y + z) + (3x + 5z) = 17 + 14 + 41
  -- 6x + 6y + 6z = 72
  -- x + y + z = 12

  have h : 6 * x + 6 * y + 6 * z = 72 := by linarith

  -- From this equation, we can directly conclude that x + y + z = 12.
