-- Given the equations $3x+y=17$, $5y+z=14$ and $3x+5z=41$, what is the value of the sum $x+y+z$? Show that it is 12.

  -- We need to add all the equations together. But before doing that, we better check if the sum of the coefficients
  -- of $x$, $y$ and $z$ are the same in all the equations. It's easy to check that adding the first and third equations
  -- gives $3x+y+5z=58$ which means that the coefficient of $x$ is the same. For that of $y$, we can see that
  -- $3x+5y+z=14$ is the same as $3x+y+5z=17+14-14=17$ which is the same as the first equation. Thus, adding all the
  -- equations together will give $(3x+y+5z)+(3x+5y+z)+(5y+z+3x)=(17+14+41)+12$ where the right-hand side comes from
  -- the left-hand side by the distributivity of the real multiplication over addition.

  have : 3 * x + y + 5 * z = 58 := by linarith

  have : 3 * x + 5 * y + z = 17 := by linarith

  have : 5 * y + z + 3 * x = 41 + 12 := by linarith

  -- Then, we add all the equations together.

  have : (3 * x + y + 5 * z) + (3 * x + 5 * y + z) + (5 * y + z + 3 * x) =
      (58 : ℝ) + 17 + (41 + 12) := by rw [‹3 * x + y + 5 * z = 58›, ‹3 * x + 5 * y + z = 17›,
      ‹5 * y + z + 3 * x = 41 + 12›]

  -- The left-hand side is the same as $(3+3+3)x+(1+5+5)y+(5+1+12)z=12$.

  have : (3 * x + y + 5 * z) + (3 * x + 5 * y + z) + (5 * y + z + 3 * x) =
      12 := by linarith

  -- We can then conclude that $x+y+z=12$.
