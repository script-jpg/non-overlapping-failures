-- Given the equations $3x+y=17,5y+z=14$ and $3x+5z=41$, what is the value of the sum $x+y+z$? Show that it is 12.



  -- without loss of generality, we can assume x + y + z = 12, and try to prove it.

  -- to prove it, we must use all conditions. there are 3 variables, 3 equations. maybe we can use elimination.

  have h3 : x + y + z = 12 := by

    -- add all equations: 3x+y+5y+z+3x+5z = 17+14+41

    -- thus 6x+6y+6z = 72

    -- so x + y + z = 12

    have : 6 * x + 6 * y + 6 * z = 72 := by linarith only [h₀, h₁, h₂]

    -- another way, we can use linarith to solve it.

    linarith

  exact h3
