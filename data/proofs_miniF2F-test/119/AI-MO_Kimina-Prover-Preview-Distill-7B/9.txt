The final answer is 12.
To find the value of \( x + y + z \), we start with the given equations:

1. \( 3x + y = 17 \)
2. \( 5y + z = 14 \)
3. \( 3x + 5z = 41 \)

First, we add all three equations together:

\[
(3x + y) + (5y + z) + (3x + 5z) = 17 + 14 + 41
\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[
3x + y + 5y + z + 3x + 5z = 6x + 6y + 6z
\]

So we have:

\[
6x + 6y + 6z = 72
\]

Dividing both sides by 6:

\[
x + y + z = 12
\]

Thus, the value of \( x + y + z \) is 12.

The Lean proof would look like this:

Now we define the theorem with the given conditions and the goal:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_427 (x y z : ℝ) (h₀ : 3 * x + y = 17) (h₁ : 5 * y + z = 14)
    (h₂ : 3 * x + 5 * z = 41) : x + y + z = 12 := by
```

We have three equations:
- \( h₀: 3x + y = 17 \)
- \( h₁: 5y + z = 14 \)
- \( h₂: 3x + 5z = 41 \)

Adding all three equations:
\( (3x + y) + (5y + z) + (3x + 5z) = 17 + 14 + 41 \)

This simplifies to:
\( 6x + 6y + 6z = 72 \)

Dividing by 6:
\( x + y + z = 12 \)

In Lean, we can prove this directly using linear arithmetic:

```tactics
linarith
```

The Lean tactic `linarith` is powerful enough to solve linear arithmetic goals. It will:
1. Combine the three equations
2. Simplify to get \( 6x + 6y + 6z = 72 \)
3. Divide by 6 to get \( x + y + z = 12 \)

Therefore, the complete proof is simply `linarith`, as it can handle all the algebraic manipulations automatically.
