-- Given the equations $3x+y=17,5y+z=14$ and $3x+5z=41$, what is the value of the sum $x+y+z$? Show that it is 12.

  -- We need to find the value of x + y + z.

  -- Let's add all three equations:
  -- (3x + y) + (5y + z) + (3x + 5z) = 17 + 14 + 41
  have h3 : 3 * x + y + (5 * y + z) + (3 * x + 5 * z) = 17 + 14 + 41 := by
    linarith

  -- Simplifying the left side: 3x + y + 5y + z + 3x + 5z = 6x + 6y + 6z
  have h4 : 6 * x + 6 * y + 6 * z = 72 := by
    linarith

  -- Divide both sides by 6: x + y + z = 12
  linarith
