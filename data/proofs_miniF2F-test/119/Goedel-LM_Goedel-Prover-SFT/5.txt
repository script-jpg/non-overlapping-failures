  Given the equations \(3x + y = 17\), \(5y + z = 14\), and \(3x + 5z = 41\), we need to find the value of the sum \(x + y + z\). By using the given equations and basic algebraic manipulations, we can derive that \(x + y + z = 12\).

  -- We need to find the value of x + y + z.
  have h₃ : x + y + z = 12 := by
    -- Using the given equations, we can derive the value of x + y + z.
    -- First, we add the three equations together:
    -- (3x + y) + (5y + z) + (3x + 5z) = 17 + 14 + 41
    -- Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:
    -- 6x + 6y + 6z = 72
    -- Dividing both sides by 6, we obtain:
    -- x + y + z = 12
    nlinarith
  -- We have derived that x + y + z = 12, so we can conclude the proof.
