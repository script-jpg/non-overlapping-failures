  Given the equations \(3x + y = 17\), \(5y + z = 14\), and \(3x + 5z = 41\), we need to find the value of the sum \(x + y + z\). We will show that it is 12.
  First, we add the three given equations:
  \[
  (3x + y) + (5y + z) + (3x + 5z) = 17 + 14 + 41
  \]
  Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:
  \[
  3x + y + 5y + z + 3x + 5z = 6x + 6y + 6z
  \]
  Thus, we have:
  \[
  6x + 6y + 6z = 72
  \]
  Dividing both sides by 6, we obtain:
  \[
  x + y + z = 12
  \]
