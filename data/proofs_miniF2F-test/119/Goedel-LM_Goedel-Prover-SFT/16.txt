  Given the equations \(3x + y = 17\), \(5y + z = 14\), and \(3x + 5z = 41\), we need to find the value of the sum \(x + y + z\) and show that it is 12.
  First, we add all three equations together:
  \[
  (3x + y) + (5y + z) + (3x + 5z) = 17 + 14 + 41
  \]
  Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:
  \[
  6x + 6y + 6z = 72
  \]
  Dividing both sides by 6, we obtain:
  \[
  x + y + z = 12
  \]
  Thus, the value of the sum \(x + y + z\) is indeed 12.

  -- We start by adding all three given equations together.
  have h₃ := congr_arg (fun x => x + 17) h₂
  -- This step is not strictly necessary for the proof but shows a way to use the given equations.
  have h₄ := congr_arg (fun x => x + 14) h₁
  -- Simplify the resulting equations.
  simp at h₃ h₄
  -- Combine all the equations to solve for x + y + z.
