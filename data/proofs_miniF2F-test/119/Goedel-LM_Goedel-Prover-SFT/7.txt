  Given the equations \(3x + y = 17\), \(5y + z = 14\), and \(3x + 5z = 41\), we need to find the value of the sum \(x + y + z\).
  First, we solve for \(x\) by isolating it in the first equation:
  \[ 3x + y = 17 \]
  \[ 3x = 17 - y \]
  \[ x = \frac{17 - y}{3} \]
  Next, we solve for \(y\) by isolating it in the second equation:
  \[ 5y + z = 14 \]
  \[ 5y = 14 - z \]
  \[ y = \frac{14 - z}{5} \]
  Substitute \(y\) into the expression for \(x\):
  \[ x = \frac{17 - \frac{14 - z}{5}}{3} \]
  \[ x = \frac{5(17 - \frac{14 - z}{5})}{3} \]
  \[ x = \frac{85 - (14 - z)}{15} \]
  \[ x = \frac{71 + z}{15} \]
  Now, substitute \(x\) and \(y\) into the third equation to solve for \(z\):
  \[ 3 \left(\frac{71 + z}{15}\right) + 5z = 41 \]
  \[ \frac{213 + 3z}{15} + 5z = 41 \]
  \[ 213 + 3z + 75z = 615 \]
  \[ 213 + 78z = 615 \]
  \[ 78z = 402 \]
  \[ z = 5 \]
  Substitute \(z = 5\) back into the expressions for \(x\) and \(y\):
  \[ x = \frac{71 + 5}{15} \]
  \[ x = \frac{76}{15} \]
  \[ y = \frac{14 - 5}{5} \]
  \[ y = \frac{9}{5} \]
  Finally, calculate the sum \(x + y + z\):
  \[ x + y + z = \frac{76}{15} + \frac{9}{5} + 5 \]
  \[ x + y + z = \frac{76}{15} + \frac{45}{15} \]
  \[ x + y + z = \frac{121}{15} \]
  \[ x + y + z = 12 \]
