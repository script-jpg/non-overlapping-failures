  Given the equations \(3x + y = 17\), \(5y + z = 14\), and \(3x + 5z = 41\), we need to find the value of the sum \(x + y + z\) and show that it equals 12.
  First, we express \(x\) in terms of \(y\) using the first equation:
  \[ x = \frac{17 - y}{3} \]
  Next, we substitute this expression for \(x\) into the second and third equations. We then solve the resulting system of linear equations for \(y\) and \(z\). Finally, we substitute the values of \(y\) and \(z\) back into the expression for \(x\) to find \(x + y + z\).
