  Given the equations \(3x + y = 17\), \(5y + z = 14\), and \(3x + 5z = 41\), we need to find the value of the sum \(x + y + z\). We will show that this value is 12.
  First, we solve the system of equations step by step. We can use the method of elimination or substitution to find the values of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\). Here, we will use the method of elimination.
  1. Multiply the first equation \(3x + y = 17\) by 5 to align the coefficients of \(y\) in the second equation \(5y + z = 14\).
  2. Multiply the first equation \(3x + y = 17\) by 3 to align the coefficients of \(x\) in the third equation \(3x + 5z = 41\).
  3. Subtract the modified first equation from the second equation to eliminate \(y\).
  4. Subtract the modified first equation from the third equation to eliminate \(x\).
  5. Solve the resulting system of linear equations to find the values of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\).
  6. Sum the values of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) to find the sum \(x + y + z\).
