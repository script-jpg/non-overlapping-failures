  Given the equations \(3x + y = 17\), \(5y + z = 14\), and \(3x + 5z = 41\), we need to find the value of the sum \(x + y + z\). By solving these equations simultaneously, we can determine the values of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\).
  First, we solve for \(x\) using the first equation:
  \[ 3x + y = 17 \]
  Next, we solve for \(y\) using the second equation:
  \[ 5y + z = 14 \]
  Finally, we solve for \(z\) using the third equation:
  \[ 3x + 5z = 41 \]
  By substituting the values of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) into the expression \(x + y + z\), we find that:
  \[ x + y + z = 12 \]

  -- Solve for z using the second equation
  have z_val : z = 14 - 5 * y := by linarith
  -- Solve for y using the third equation
  have y_val : y = 41 - 3 * x := by linarith
