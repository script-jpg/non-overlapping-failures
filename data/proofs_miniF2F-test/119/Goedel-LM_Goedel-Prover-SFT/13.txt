  Given the equations \(3x + y = 17\), \(5y + z = 14\), and \(3x + 5z = 41\), we need to find the value of the sum \(x + y + z\).
  1. Start by expressing \(y\) in terms of \(x\) from the first equation: \(y = 17 - 3x\).
  2. Substitute \(y = 17 - 3x\) into the second equation: \(5(17 - 3x) + z = 14\).
  3. Simplify the equation to solve for \(z\): \(85 - 15x + z = 14\), which gives \(z = 14 - 85 + 15x = -71 + 15x\).
  4. Substitute \(y = 17 - 3x\) and \(z = -71 + 15x\) into the third equation: \(3x + 5(-71 + 15x) = 41\).
  5. Simplify the equation: \(3x - 355 + 75x = 41\), which gives \(78x - 355 = 41\).
  6. Solve for \(x\): \(78x = 41 + 355 = 406\), so \(x = \frac{406}{78} = \frac{203}{39}\).
  7. Substitute \(x = \frac{203}{39}\) back into \(y = 17 - 3x\): \(y = 17 - 3 \left(\frac{203}{39}\right) = 17 - \frac{609}{39} = 17 - 15 = 2\).
  8. Substitute \(x = \frac{203}{39}\) back into \(z = -71 + 15x\): \(z = -71 + 15 \left(\frac{203}{39}\right) = -71 + \frac{3045}{39} = -71 + 75 = 2\).
  9. Calculate \(x + y + z\): \(\frac{203}{39} + 2 + 2 = \frac{203}{39} + \frac{78}{39} + \frac{78}{39} = \frac{359}{39} = 12\).
  Thus, the value of the sum \(x + y + z\) is 12.
