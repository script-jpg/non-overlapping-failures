norm_num
```

This Lean proof is straightforward because it involves basic arithmetic operations. The `norm_num` tactic calculates the sum of the numbers and then computes the remainder when divided by 7. 

To understand why the remainder is 0, we can calculate the sum and then divide by 7:
- The sum is $2000 + 2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006 = 14021$.
- When 14021 is divided by 7, the quotient is 2002 and the remainder is 7 (since $14021 = 7 \times 2002 + 7$).

However, upon further inspection, the remainder should actually be 0. Let me double-check the calculation:
- $2000 \equiv 2000 \pmod{7} \equiv 2000 - 7 \times 285 = 2000 - 1995 = 5 \pmod{7}$
- $2001 \equiv 2001 - 7 \times 285 = 2001 - 1995 = 6 \pmod{7}$
- $2002 \equiv 2002 - 7 \times 285 = 2002 - 1995 = 7 \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$
- $2003 \equiv 2003 - 7 \times 285 = 2003 - 1995 = 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}$
- $2004 \equiv 2004 - 7 \times 285 = 2004 - 1995 = 9 \equiv 2 \pmod{7}$
- $2005 \equiv 2005 - 7 \times 285 = 2005 - 1995 = 10 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}$
- $2006 \equiv 2006 - 7 \times 285 = 2006 - 1995 = 11 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}$

Adding these remainders: $5 + 6 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 21$.
Since $21 \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$, the remainder when $2000 + 2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006$ is divided by 7 is indeed 0.

The Lean proof is complete. The `norm_num` tactic handles all the arithmetic calculations, confirming that the remainder is 0.
