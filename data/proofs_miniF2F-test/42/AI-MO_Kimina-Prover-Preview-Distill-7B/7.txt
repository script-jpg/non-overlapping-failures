-- Compute the sum of the numbers
  let sum := 2000 + 2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006

  -- Compute the remainder when the sum is divided by 7
  have h : sum % 7 = 0 := by
    norm_num [sum]

  -- Conclude that the remainder is 0
  exact h
```

This solution is straightforward: we compute the sum of the numbers and then calculate the remainder when divided by 7. The Lean proof uses `norm_num` to compute the arithmetic, which is efficient for concrete numerical calculations.

The key insight is that Lean can directly compute the value of the expression `(2000 + 2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006) % 7` and verify that it equals 0. This is a direct proof that requires no complex number theory techniques, simply computational verification.

Therefore, the remainder when $2000+2001+2002+2003+2004+2005+2006$ is divided by $7$ is indeed 0.
