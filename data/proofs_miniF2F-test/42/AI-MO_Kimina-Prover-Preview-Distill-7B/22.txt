This Lean 4 proof demonstrates how to compute the remainder of the sum $2000 + 2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006$ when divided by $7$. Instead of summing the entire numbers and then taking modulo, we can take the modulo of each number first and then sum the results. This approach leverages the properties of modular arithmetic, specifically that $(a + b) \bmod m = ((a \bmod m) + (b \bmod m)) \bmod m$. 

First, we rewrite the sum as $7 + 7 \cdot 285 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6$. This decomposition helps because $7 \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$ and $7 \cdot 285 \equiv 0 \pmod{7}$ since both terms are multiples of $7$. 

Next, we compute the remainder of each term modulo $7$:
- $7 \bmod 7 = 0$
- $7 \cdot 285 \bmod 7 = 0$
- $1 \bmod 7 = 1$
- $2 \bmod 7 = 2$
- $3 \bmod 7 = 3$
- $4 \bmod 7 = 4$
- $5 \bmod 7 = 5$
- $6 \bmod 7 = 6$

Adding these remainders: $0 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21$

Finally, we compute $21 \bmod 7 = 0$ because $21$ is divisible by $7$.

Therefore, the remainder when $2000 + 2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006$ is divided by $7$ is $0$.
