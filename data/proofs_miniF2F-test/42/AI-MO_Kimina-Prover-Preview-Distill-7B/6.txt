This Lean 4 proof is calculating the remainder when $2000 + 2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006$ is divided by $7$ and proving it equals $0$. The approach is straightforward: compute the sum, compute the remainder when divided by 7, and verify it is 0.

Let's compute the sum first:
$2000 + 2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006 = 14021$

Now compute $14021 \bmod 7$:
To compute $14021 \div 7$, we can perform the division:
$14021 \div 7 = 2003$ with a remainder of $0$ because $14021 = 7 \times 2003$.

Therefore $14021 \bmod 7 = 0$.

In Lean, the proof is remarkably concise because Lean's computational infrastructure is powerful enough to compute arithmetic expressions directly. The `norm_num` tactic is sufficient to compute the numerical expression and verify the equality.

So our complete Lean 4 proof is:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

These imports and settings are standard for many Lean proofs. The import of Mathlib gives us access to Lean's mathematical library, Aesop is a powerful automated tactic for solving goals, the maxHeartbeats setting allows Lean to work harder at solving the goal, and the open command brings various namespaces into scope for easier access to their definitions.

Now for the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_345 : (2000 + 2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006) % 7 = 0 := by
  norm_num
```

This theorem statement is exactly the problem we're trying to solve: what is the remainder when $2000 + 2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006$ is divided by 7? The answer should be 0.

The proof is complete with just the `norm_num` tactic. This tactic is powerful enough to compute arithmetic goals involving concrete numbers. It will compute the sum of all the numbers, compute the modulus with 7, and check that it equals 0. Lean's computational capability is sufficient to handle this arithmetic directly without further breakdown.

Therefore, the Lean proof correctly answers the problem: the remainder when $2000 + 2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006$ is divided by 7 is indeed 0.
