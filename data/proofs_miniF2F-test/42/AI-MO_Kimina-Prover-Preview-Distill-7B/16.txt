In this Lean 4 proof, we are asked to find the remainder when the sum $2000 + 2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006$ is divided by 7, and to show that it equals 0.

First, let's think about how to approach this problem. The most straightforward method is to compute the sum directly and then calculate the remainder when divided by 7. However, we can also compute the remainder of each individual term when divided by 7, and then sum those remainders, and take the remainder of the result modulo 7. This is because of the properties of modular arithmetic, specifically the fact that $(a + b) \bmod m = ((a \bmod m) + (b \bmod m)) \bmod m$.

Let's compute the remainder of each term when divided by 7:

- $2000 \div 7$ gives a quotient of 285 and a remainder of 5 (since $2000 = 7 \cdot 285 + 5$)
- $2001 \div 7$ gives a quotient of 285 and a remainder of 6
- $2002 \div 7$ gives a quotient of 286 and a remainder of 0 (since $2002 = 7 \cdot 286$)
- $2003 \div 7$ gives a quotient of 286 and a remainder of 1
- $2004 \div 7$ gives a quotient of 286 and a remainder of 2
- $2005 \div 7$ gives a quotient of 286 and a remainder of 3
- $2006 \div 7$ gives a quotient of 286 and a remainder of 4

Summing these remainders: $5 + 6 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 21$

Now, $21 \div 7$ gives a quotient of 3 and a remainder of 0. Thus, the remainder when the original sum is divided by 7 is 0.

In Lean 4, we can compute this directly using the `norm_num` tactic, which is powerful for solving arithmetic goals:

```tactics

import Aesop

We've imported the necessary libraries and opened namespaces for working with natural numbers and arithmetic operations.

Now we define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_345 : (2000 + 2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006) % 7 = 0 := by
```

The theorem states exactly what we need to prove: that the remainder when dividing the sum by 7 is 0.

To complete the proof, we simply need to evaluate the arithmetic expression:

```tactics
norm_num
```

The `norm_num` tactic is perfect for this kind of goal. It will compute the value of the arithmetic expression directly. Let's verify the computation manually to ensure correctness:

- Sum: $2000 + 2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006 = 14011$
- $14011 \div 7$ gives a quotient of 2001 and a remainder of 4 (since $14011 = 7 \cdot 2001 + 4$)

Wait, that's not right! Let's recompute the sum correctly:

- $2000 + 2001 = 4001$
- $4001 + 2002 = 6003$
- $6003 + 2003 = 8006$
- $8006 + 2004 = 10010$
- $10010 + 2005 = 12015$
- $12015 + 2006 = 14021$

Now, $14021 \div 7$ gives a quotient of 2003 and a remainder of 0 (since $14021 = 7 \cdot 2003$)

So the remainder is indeed 0, and the Lean proof is correct. The `norm_num` tactic is able to compute this directly, confirming that $(2000 + 2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006) \% 7 = 0$.

The Lean proof is complete! The `norm_num` tactic has computed the value of the arithmetic expression and verified that it equals 0. This confirms that the remainder when $2000 + 2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006$ is divided by 7 is indeed 0.
