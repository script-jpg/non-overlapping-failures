In this problem, we need to find the remainder when the sum $2000 + 2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006$ is divided by 7. To show that the remainder is 0, we can calculate the sum modulo 7 directly.

First, let's compute each number modulo 7:
- $2000 \div 7$ gives remainder $2000 \mod 7 = 2000 - 7 \cdot 285 = 2000 - 1995 = 5$
- $2001 \div 7$ gives remainder $2001 \mod 7 = 2001 - 7 \cdot 285 = 2001 - 1995 = 6$
- $2002 \div 7$ gives remainder $2002 \mod 7 = 2002 - 7 \cdot 286 = 2002 - 2002 = 0$
- $2003 \div 7$ gives remainder $2003 \mod 7 = 2003 - 7 \cdot 286 = 2003 - 2002 = 1$
- $2004 \div 7$ gives remainder $2004 \mod 7 = 2004 - 7 \cdot 286 = 2004 - 2002 = 2$
- $2005 \div 7$ gives remainder $2005 \mod 7 = 2005 - 7 \cdot 286 = 2005 - 2002 = 3$
- $2006 \div 7$ gives remainder $2006 \mod 7 = 2006 - 7 \cdot 286 = 2006 - 2002 = 4$

Now sum these remainders:
$5 + 6 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 21$

Finally, $21 \div 7$ gives remainder $0$.

Therefore, the remainder when $2000 + 2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006$ is divided by 7 is 0.

In Lean, we can use the `norm_num` tactic to compute this directly:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

Now we define the theorem:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_345 : (2000 + 2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006) % 7 = 0 := by
```

And prove it with `norm_num`:

```tactics
norm_num
```

The `norm_num` tactic is powerful enough to compute arithmetic expressions and verify equalities of concrete natural numbers. It will compute the sum, compute the modulo 7, and verify that it equals 0.
