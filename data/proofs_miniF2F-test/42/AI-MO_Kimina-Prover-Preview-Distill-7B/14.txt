# Finding the Remainder of $2000 + 2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006$ When Divided by 7

Let's solve this number theory problem about finding remainders. We need to find the remainder when the sum $2000 + 2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006$ is divided by 7.

First, I'll think about how to approach this. When finding the remainder of a sum modulo a number, we can either:
1. Sum all the numbers first, then take the remainder
2. Take the remainder of each number, then sum the remainders

The second approach often simplifies calculations. Let's try that.

Each number in the sum is of the form $2000 + k$ where $k$ ranges from 0 to 6. Let's find each $2000 + k \bmod 7$:

- $2000 \bmod 7$: We need to compute $2000 \div 7$ to find the remainder. $2000 \div 7 \approx 285.71$, so $7 \times 285 = 1995$. Thus $2000 \bmod 7 = 2000 - 1995 = 5$.
- $2001 \bmod 7 = (2000 + 1) \bmod 7 = (5 + 1) \bmod 7 = 6$
- $2002 \bmod 7 = (2000 + 2) \bmod 7 = (5 + 2) \bmod 7 = 0$
- $2003 \bmod 7 = (2000 + 3) \bmod 7 = (5 + 3) \bmod 7 = 1$
- $2004 \bmod 7 = (2000 + 4) \bmod 7 = (5 + 4) \bmod 7 = 2$
- $2005 \bmod 7 = (2000 + 5) \bmod 7 = (5 + 5) \bmod 7 = 3$
- $2006 \bmod 7 = (2000 + 6) \bmod 7 = (5 + 6) \bmod 7 = 4$

Now sum these remainders: $6 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 16$

Finally, $16 \bmod 7 = 2$ because $7 \times 2 = 14$ and $16 - 14 = 2$.

Wait, let me recalculate more carefully. Actually:
- $2000 \bmod 7 = 2000 - 7 \times 285 = 2000 - 1995 = 5$ ✓
- Sum of remainders: $5 + 6 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 21$
- $21 \bmod 7 = 0$ because $7 \times 3 = 21$ ✓

So the remainder is 0. Let's formalize this in Lean:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

We've imported the necessary libraries and set up the basic imports. Now let's define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_345 : (2000 + 2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006) % 7 = 0 := by
```

Now we need to prove this. One approach is to use Lean's computation capabilities:

```tactics
norm_num
```

The `norm_num` tactic is powerful for computational goals like this. It will compute the exact value of the sum modulo 7 and verify that it equals 0.

So our complete proof is:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat

theorem mathd_numbertheory_345 : (2000 + 2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006) % 7 = 0 := by
  norm_num
```

This proof is remarkably concise because Lean's `norm_num` tactic is powerful enough to compute arithmetic goals directly. The tactic will:
1. Compute the sum: $2000 + 2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006 = 14011$
2. Compute $14011 \bmod 7$
3. Verify that the remainder is 0

Therefore, the remainder when $2000 + 2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006$ is divided by 7 is indeed 0.
