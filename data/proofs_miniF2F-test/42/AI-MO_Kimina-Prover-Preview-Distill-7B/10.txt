-- Calculate the sum of the numbers
  let sum := 2000 + 2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006

  -- Calculate the remainder when the sum is divided by 7
  let remainder := sum % 7

  -- Show that the remainder is 0 by using the `norm_num` tactic, which can compute arithmetic goals
  norm_num [sum, remainder]
```

This proof is straightforward since it primarily involves arithmetic calculations. The `norm_num` tactic is powerful for solving goals involving concrete numbers and arithmetic operations. It automatically computes the sum of the numbers, calculates the remainder when divided by 7, and verifies that the remainder is indeed 0.

The key insight is that the sum of these consecutive numbers can be calculated directly, and then we apply the modulo operation. The result happens to be 0, which means that the sum is divisible by 7.

The complete proof is remarkably concise because Lean's automation can handle arithmetic computations efficiently. This demonstrates how proof assistants can verify concrete arithmetic facts with minimal guidance.
