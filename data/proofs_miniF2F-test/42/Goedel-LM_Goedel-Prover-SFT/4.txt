  To determine the remainder when the sum \(2000 + 2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006\) is divided by 7, we can use modular arithmetic. First, we compute the remainders of each number when divided by 7:
  - \(2000 \mod 7 = 6\)
  - \(2001 \mod 7 = 0\)
  - \(2002 \mod 7 = 1\)
  - \(2003 \mod 7 = 2\)
  - \(2004 \mod 7 = 3\)
  - \(2005 \mod 7 = 4\)
  - \(2006 \mod 7 = 5\)
  Thus, the sum modulo 7 is:
  \[
  (2000 + 2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006) \mod 7 \equiv (6 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) \mod 7
  \]
  Calculating the sum inside the modulus:
  \[
  6 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 21
  \]
  Finally, we find the remainder of 21 when divided by 7:
  \[
  21 \mod 7 = 0
  \]
  Therefore, the remainder when \(2000 + 2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006\) is divided by 7 is 0.
