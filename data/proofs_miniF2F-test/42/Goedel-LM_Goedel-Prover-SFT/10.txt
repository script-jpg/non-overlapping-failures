  To determine the remainder when \(2000 + 2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006\) is divided by 7, we can use modular arithmetic. First, we find the remainders of each number when divided by 7:
  \[
  2000 \mod 7 = 6, \quad 2001 \mod 7 = 0, \quad 2002 \mod 7 = 1, \quad 2003 \mod 7 = 2, \quad 2004 \mod 7 = 3, \quad 2005 \mod 7 = 4, \quad 2006 \mod 7 = 5
  \]
  Next, we sum these remainders:
  \[
  6 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 21
  \]
  Finally, we find the remainder of 21 when divided by 7:
  \[
  21 \mod 7 = 0
  \]
  Thus, the remainder when \(2000 + 2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006\) is divided by 7 is 0.
