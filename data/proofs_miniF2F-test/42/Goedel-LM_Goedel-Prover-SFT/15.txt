  To determine the remainder when \(2000 + 2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006\) is divided by 7, we can use modular arithmetic to simplify the problem. First, we find the remainders of each number modulo 7:
  - \(2000 \mod 7 = 6\)
  - \(2001 \mod 7 = 0\)
  - \(2002 \mod 7 = 1\)
  - \(2003 \mod 7 = 2\)
  - \(2004 \mod 7 = 3\)
  - \(2005 \mod 7 = 4\)
  - \(2006 \mod 7 = 5\)
  Adding these remainders together:
  \[6 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 21\]
  Finally, we find the remainder of 21 modulo 7:
  \[21 \mod 7 = 0\]
  Thus, the remainder when \(2000 + 2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006\) is divided by 7 is 0.
