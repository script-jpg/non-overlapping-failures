  Given the equations \(4^a = 5\), \(5^b = 6\), \(6^c = 7\), and \(7^d = 8\), we need to find the product \(a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d\). We start by noting that the product of the logarithms of the bases is equal to the product of the logarithms of the numbers themselves. Specifically, we have:
  \[
  \log_4(5) \cdot \log_5(6) \cdot \log_6(7) \cdot \log_7(8) = \log_4(8)
  \]
  Since \(\log_4(8) = 3\), we can simplify the left-hand side to:
  \[
  \log_4(5) \cdot \log_5(6) \cdot \log_6(7) \cdot \log_7(8) = 3
  \]
  Next, we use the change of base formula for logarithms to express each logarithm in terms of natural logarithms. For example, \(\log_4(5) = \frac{\ln(5)}{\ln(4)}\). Substituting these into the equation, we get:
  \[
  \frac{\ln(5)}{\ln(4)} \cdot \frac{\ln(6)}{\ln(5)} \cdot \frac{\ln(7)}{\ln(6)} \cdot \frac{\ln(8)}{\ln(7)} = 3
  \]
  Simplifying the product of the fractions, we have:
  \[
  \frac{\ln(8)}{\ln(4)} = 3
  \]
  Since \(\ln(8) = 3 \ln(2)\) and \(\ln(4) = 2 \ln(2)\), we get:
  \[
  \frac{3 \ln(2)}{2 \ln(2)} = 3
  \]
  This simplifies to:
  \[
  \frac{3}{2} = 3
  \]
  Thus, the product \(a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d\) is \(\frac{3}{2}\).
