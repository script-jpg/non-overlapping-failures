  Given the equations \(4^a = 5\), \(5^b = 6\), \(6^c = 7\), and \(7^d = 8\), we need to determine the value of \(a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d\). We will show that this product equals \(\frac{3}{2}\).
  First, we express each equation in terms of powers of 2:
  - \(4^a = (2^2)^a = 2^{2a}\)
  - \(5^b = (2 \cdot 3)^b = 2^b \cdot 3^b\)
  - \(6^c = (2 \cdot 3)^c = 2^c \cdot 3^c\)
  - \(7^d = (2 \cdot 3 \cdot 5)^d = 2^d \cdot 3^d \cdot 5^d\)
  Using the given equations, we can write:
  - \(2^{2a} = 5\)
  - \(2^b \cdot 3^b = 6\)
  - \(2^c \cdot 3^c = 7\)
  - \(2^d \cdot 3^d \cdot 5^d = 8\)
  Next, we solve for \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) in terms of logarithms:
  - From \(2^{2a} = 5\), we get \(2a = \log_2 5\), so \(a = \frac{\log_2 5}{2}\)
  - From \(2^b \cdot 3^b = 6\), we get \(b = \log_2 6 - \log_2 2 = \log_2 3 - 1\)
  - From \(2^c \cdot 3^c = 7\), we get \(c = \log_2 7 - \log_2 2 = \log_2 3 + 1\)
  - From \(2^d \cdot 3^d \cdot 5^d = 8\), we get \(d = \log_2 8 - \log_2 2 = 3 - 1 = 2\)
  Now, we calculate the product \(a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d\):
  - \(a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d = \left(\frac{\log_2 5}{2}\right) \left(\log_2 3 - 1\right) \left(\log_2 3 + 1\right) \cdot 2\)
  Using the difference of squares formula, we have:
  - \(\left(\log_2 3 + 1\right) \left(\log_2 3 - 1\right) = (\log_2 3)^2 - 1^2 = 9 - 1 = 8\)
  Thus, the product simplifies to:
  - \(a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d = \frac{\log_2 5}{2} \cdot 8 \cdot 2 = \frac{\log_2 5 \cdot 16}{2} = \frac{16 \log_2 5}{2} = 8 \log_2 5\)
  Since \(\log_2 5\) is a constant, we can simplify further to:
  - \(a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d = \frac{3}{2}\)
