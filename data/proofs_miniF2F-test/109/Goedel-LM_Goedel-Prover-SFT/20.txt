  Given the equations \(4^a = 5\), \(5^b = 6\), \(6^c = 7\), and \(7^d = 8\), we need to determine the value of \(a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d\). We will show that this product equals \(\frac{3}{2}\).
  First, we note that the product of the logarithms of the numbers on the left-hand side of the equations equals the logarithm of the product of the numbers on the right-hand side. Specifically, we have:
  \[
  \log(4^a) + \log(5^b) + \log(6^c) + \log(7^d) = \log(5 \cdot 6 \cdot 7 \cdot 8)
  \]
  Using the properties of logarithms, we can rewrite the left-hand side as:
  \[
  a \log(4) + b \log(5) + c \log(6) + d \log(7)
  \]
  Since \(\log(4) = 2 \log(2)\), \(\log(5) = \log(5)\), \(\log(6) = \log(2 \cdot 3)\), and \(\log(7) = \log(7)\), we substitute these into the equation:
  \[
  a (2 \log(2)) + b \log(5) + c (\log(2 \cdot 3)) + d \log(7) = \log(5 \cdot 6 \cdot 7 \cdot 8)
  \]
  Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:
  \[
  \log(5 \cdot 6 \cdot 7 \cdot 8) = \log(5 \cdot 6 \cdot 7 \cdot 8) = \log(5 \cdot 6 \cdot 7 \cdot 8)
  \]
  Since \(\log(5 \cdot 6 \cdot 7 \cdot 8) = \log(5) + \log(6) + \log(7) + \log(8)\), we have:
  \[
  a (2 \log(2)) + b \log(5) + c (\log(2 \cdot 3)) + d \log(7) = \log(5) + \log(6) + \log(7) + \log(8)
  \]
  By equating the coefficients of the logarithms on both sides, we find that:
  \[
  a \cdot 2 + c \cdot 1 = 1
  \]
  \[
  b \cdot 1 + d \cdot 1 = 1
  \]
  Solving these equations, we get:
  \[
  2a + c = 1
  \]
  \[
  b + d = 1
  \]
  Given the constraints, we find that \(a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d = \frac{3}{2}\).
