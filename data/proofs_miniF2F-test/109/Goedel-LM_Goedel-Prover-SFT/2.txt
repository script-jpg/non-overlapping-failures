  Given the equations \(4^a = 5\), \(5^b = 6\), \(6^c = 7\), and \(7^d = 8\), we need to determine the value of \(a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d\). We will show that this value is \(\frac{3}{2}\).
  1. Start by taking the natural logarithm of each equation to convert the exponents into logarithms.
  2. Simplify the resulting expressions using properties of logarithms.
  3. Use algebraic manipulation to combine and simplify the terms.
  4. Finally, solve for the product \(a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d\) and verify that it equals \(\frac{3}{2}\).
