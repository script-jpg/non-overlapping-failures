  Given the equations \(4^a = 5\), \(5^b = 6\), \(6^c = 7\), and \(7^d = 8\), we need to find the value of \(a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d\).
  1. Start by rewriting the given equations in a more convenient form.
  2. Use the properties of logarithms to express the product \(a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d\) in terms of the logarithms of the given numbers.
  3. Simplify the expression using the given equations and properties of logarithms.
  4. Verify that the simplified expression equals \(\frac{3}{2}\).
