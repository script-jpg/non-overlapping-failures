  Given the equations \(4^a = 5\), \(5^b = 6\), \(6^c = 7\), and \(7^d = 8\), we need to determine the value of \(a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d\). We start by expressing each variable in terms of the previous equation.
  1. From \(4^a = 5\), we can solve for \(a\) by taking the logarithm base 4 of both sides:
     \[
     a = \log_4 5
     \]
  2. From \(5^b = 6\), we can solve for \(b\) by taking the logarithm base 5 of both sides:
     \[
     b = \log_5 6
     \]
  3. From \(6^c = 7\), we can solve for \(c\) by taking the logarithm base 6 of both sides:
     \[
     c = \log_6 7
     \]
  4. From \(7^d = 8\), we can solve for \(d\) by taking the logarithm base 7 of both sides:
     \[
     d = \log_7 8
     \]
  Next, we multiply these values together:
  \[
  a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d = (\log_4 5) \cdot (\log_5 6) \cdot (\log_6 7) \cdot (\log_7 8)
  \]
  Using the change of base formula for logarithms, we know:
  \[
  \log_b a = \frac{\log_k a}{\log_k b}
  \]
  Thus:
  \[
  (\log_4 5) = \frac{\log_k 5}{\log_k 4}, \quad (\log_5 6) = \frac{\log_k 6}{\log_k 5}, \quad (\log_6 7) = \frac{\log_k 7}{\log_k 6}, \quad (\log_7 8) = \frac{\log_k 8}{\log_k 7}
  \]
  Multiplying these together, we get:
  \[
  a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d = \frac{\log_k 5}{\log_k 4} \cdot \frac{\log_k 6}{\log_k 5} \cdot \frac{\log_k 7}{\log_k 6} \cdot \frac{\log_k 8}{\log_k 7}
  \]
  Simplifying, we see that all intermediate terms cancel out, leaving:
  \[
  a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d = \frac{\log_k 8}{\log_k 4} = \frac{3}{2}
  \]
  Thus, the value of \(a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d\) is \(\frac{3}{2}\).
