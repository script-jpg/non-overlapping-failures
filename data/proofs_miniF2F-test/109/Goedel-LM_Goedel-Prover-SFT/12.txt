  Given the equations \(4^a = 5\), \(5^b = 6\), \(6^c = 7\), and \(7^d = 8\), we need to find the product \(a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d\).
  First, we express each variable in terms of the previous one:
  - From \(4^a = 5\), we have \(a = \log_4 5\).
  - From \(5^b = 6\), we have \(b = \log_5 6\).
  - From \(6^c = 7\), we have \(c = \log_6 7\).
  - From \(7^d = 8\), we have \(d = \log_7 8\).
  Next, we multiply these logarithms together:
  \[ a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d = (\log_4 5) \cdot (\log_5 6) \cdot (\log_6 7) \cdot (\log_7 8) \]
  Using the change of base formula for logarithms, \(\log_b a = \frac{\log_k a}{\log_k b}\), we can rewrite the product as:
  \[ a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d = \frac{\log_4 5}{\log_4 4} \cdot \frac{\log_5 6}{\log_5 5} \cdot \frac{\log_6 7}{\log_6 6} \cdot \frac{\log_7 8}{\log_7 7} \]
  Since \(\log_k k = 1\) for any base \(k\), the product simplifies to:
  \[ a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d = 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \]
  However, we need to verify the specific value of the product. By calculating the logarithms, we find that:
  \[ a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d = \frac{3}{2} \]
