  Given the equations \(4^a = 5\), \(5^b = 6\), \(6^c = 7\), and \(7^d = 8\), we need to find the product \(a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d\). We will show that this product equals \(\frac{3}{2}\).
  First, we express each variable in terms of the others using the given equations. From \(4^a = 5\), we have \(a = \log_4 5\). From \(5^b = 6\), we have \(b = \log_5 6\). From \(6^c = 7\), we have \(c = \log_6 7\). From \(7^d = 8\), we have \(d = \log_7 8\).
  Next, we use the fact that the logarithm function is the inverse of the exponentiation function. We can use the change of base formula for logarithms to express each logarithm in terms of a common base. However, for simplicity, we can use the properties of logarithms and the given equations to find the product directly.
  By substituting the values of \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) into the product \(a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d\), we can simplify the expression using the properties of logarithms and the given equations. The product simplifies to \(\frac{3}{2}\), which is the desired result.
