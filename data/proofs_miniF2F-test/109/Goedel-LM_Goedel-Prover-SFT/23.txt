  Given the equations \(4^a = 5\), \(5^b = 6\), \(6^c = 7\), and \(7^d = 8\), we need to find the value of \(a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d\).
  1. From \(4^a = 5\), we can express \(a\) in terms of the logarithm: \(a = \log_4 5\).
  2. From \(5^b = 6\), we can express \(b\) in terms of the logarithm: \(b = \log_5 6\).
  3. From \(6^c = 7\), we can express \(c\) in terms of the logarithm: \(c = \log_6 7\).
  4. From \(7^d = 8\), we can express \(d\) in terms of the logarithm: \(d = \log_7 8\).
  Using the change of base formula for logarithms, we have:
  - \(\log_4 5 = \frac{\log_2 5}{\log_2 4} = \frac{\log_2 5}{2}\)
  - \(\log_5 6 = \frac{\log_2 6}{\log_2 5}\)
  - \(\log_6 7 = \frac{\log_2 7}{\log_2 6}\)
  - \(\log_7 8 = \frac{\log_2 8}{\log_2 7}\)
  Substituting these into the expressions for \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\), we get:
  - \(a = \frac{\log_2 5}{2}\)
  - \(b = \frac{\log_2 6}{\log_2 5}\)
  - \(c = \frac{\log_2 7}{\log_2 6}\)
  - \(d = \frac{\log_2 8}{\log_2 7}\)
  Simplifying further, we find:
  - \(a = \frac{\log_2 5}{2}\)
  - \(b = \frac{\log_2 6}{\log_2 5}\)
  - \(c = \frac{\log_2 7}{\log_2 6}\)
  - \(d = \frac{\log_2 8}{\log_2 7}\)
  Using the properties of logarithms and the fact that \(\log_2 2 = 1\), we can simplify the product \(a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d\) to \(\frac{3}{2}\).
