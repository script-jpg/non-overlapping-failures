  Given the equations \(4^a = 5\), \(5^b = 6\), \(6^c = 7\), and \(7^d = 8\), we need to find the value of \(a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d\).
  First, we express each variable in terms of the others using the given equations:
  - From \(4^a = 5\), we solve for \(a\).
  - From \(5^b = 6\), we solve for \(b\).
  - From \(6^c = 7\), we solve for \(c\).
  - From \(7^d = 8\), we solve for \(d\).
  Next, we multiply these values together to find the product \(a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d\).

  -- We start by taking the natural logarithm of each equation to solve for the variables.
  have h₁ := congr_arg Real.log h₁
  have h₂ := congr_arg Real.log h₂
  have h₃ := congr_arg Real.log h₃
  have h₄ := congr_arg Real.log h₄
  -- Simplify the expressions by removing the logarithm and solving for the variables.
