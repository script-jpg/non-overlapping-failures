  Given the equations \(4^a = 5\), \(5^b = 6\), \(6^c = 7\), and \(7^d = 8\), we need to determine the value of \(a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d\). We will show that this value is \(\frac{3}{2}\).
  1. From \(4^a = 5\), we can rewrite it as \(4 = 5^a\).
  2. From \(5^b = 6\), we can rewrite it as \(5 = 6^b\).
  3. From \(6^c = 7\), we can rewrite it as \(6 = 7^c\).
  4. From \(7^d = 8\), we can rewrite it as \(7 = 8^d\).
  Next, we use the properties of exponents to combine these equations:
  - \(a = \log_5 4\)
  - \(b = \log_6 5\)
  - \(c = \log_7 6\)
  - \(d = \log_8 7\)
  We then compute the product of these logarithms:
  \[
  a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d = \log_5 4 \cdot \log_6 5 \cdot \log_7 6 \cdot \log_8 7
  \]
  Using the change of base formula for logarithms, we have:
  \[
  \log_6 5 = \frac{\log_5 6}{\log_5 6} = 1
  \]
  \[
  \log_7 6 = \frac{\log_6 7}{\log_6 7} = 1
  \]
  \[
  \log_8 7 = \frac{\log_7 8}{\log_7 8} = 1
  \]
  Thus, the product simplifies to:
  \[
  a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d = \log_5 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = \log_5 4
  \]
  Since \(\log_5 4 = \frac{3}{2}\), we conclude that:
  \[
  a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d = \frac{3}{2}
  \]
