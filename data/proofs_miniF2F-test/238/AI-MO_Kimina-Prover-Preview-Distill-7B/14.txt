This is a straightforward algebra problem. We need to find the value of $x$ such that $5 + 500\% \text{ of } 10 = 110\% \text{ of } x$.

First, let's compute $500\% \text{ of } 10$. This is $5 \times 10 = 50$.

So the left side becomes $5 + 50 = 55$.

Now we need $110\% \text{ of } x = 55$, which means $1.1x = 55$.

Solving for $x$, we have $x = \frac{55}{1.1} = 50$.

Let's verify: $110\% \text{ of } 50 = 1.1 \times 50 = 55$, which matches the left side.

Therefore, $x = 50$ is the solution.

In Lean, we can solve this using the `linarith` tactic, which is powerful enough to handle linear arithmetic goals. The equation is linear in $x$, so Lean will be able to solve it directly from the hypothesis.

The Lean proof is remarkably concise because the arithmetic is straightforward and can be solved directly by Lean's automated tactics. The `linarith` tactic is powerful enough to handle linear equations and inequalities over real numbers. In this case, it's solving the equation $5 + 500/100 \times 10 = 110/100 \times x$ for $x$.

Let's compute the left side: $500/100 \times 10 = 5 \times 10 = 50$, so $5 + 50 = 55$.

The equation becomes $55 = 110/100 \times x$, which is $55 = 1.1 \times x$. Dividing both sides by $1.1$ gives $x = 55 / 1.1 = 50$.

The Lean proof is proving that $x = 50$ is the unique solution to the given equation. The `linarith` tactic is able to solve this directly because it's a linear equation in one variable. It will rearrange the equation to isolate $x$ and compute that $x = 50$ is the only solution.

Therefore, the boxed answer is $\boxed{50}$.
