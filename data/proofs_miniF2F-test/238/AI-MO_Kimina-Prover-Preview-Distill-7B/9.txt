In this Lean 4 proof, we're tasked with finding the value of $x$ such that $5 + 500\% \text{ of } 10 = 110\% \text{ of } x$.

First, let's compute $500\% \text{ of } 10$. This is $5 \times 10 = 50$. So the left-hand side becomes $5 + 50 = 55$.

Next, $110\% \text{ of } x$ is $1.1 \times x$. So we have $55 = 1.1 \times x$.

To solve for $x$, we divide both sides by $1.1$: $x = \frac{55}{1.1} = 50$.

The Lean proof is remarkably concise. Let's deconstruct it:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

We've imported the necessary libraries and opened namespaces for working with real numbers and arithmetic operations. The `maxHeartbeats 0` setting allows Lean to use as many computational steps as needed to solve the problem.

Now, let's define our theorem:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_400 (x : ℝ) (h₀ : 5 + 500 / 100 * 10 = 110 / 100 * x) : x = 50 := by
```

We have the equation $5 + 500\% \text{ of } 10 = 110\% \text{ of } x$ represented as `h₀`. Let's compute the numerical values:
- $500\% \text{ of } 10 = \frac{500}{100} \times 10 = 5 \times 10 = 50$
- So the left side is $5 + 50 = 55$
- $110\% \text{ of } x = \frac{110}{100} \times x = 1.1 \times x$
- Thus we have $55 = 1.1 \times x$, which means $x = \frac{55}{1.1} = 50$

The Lean proof can solve this directly with `linarith`:

```tactics
linarith
```

The `linarith` tactic is powerful for solving linear arithmetic problems. It automatically:
1. Recognizes that $5 + 500/100 \times 10 = 55$
2. Recognizes that $110/100 \times x = 1.1 \times x$
3. Solves $55 = 1.1 \times x$ to get $x = 50$
4. Verifies that this is indeed the only solution

The Lean proof is complete! It has proven that $x = 50$ is the unique solution to the equation $5 + 500\% \text{ of } 10 = 110\% \text{ of } x$.
