-- $500\%$ of $10$ is $500/100 \cdot 10 = 50$
  have : 500 / 100 * 10 = 50 := by norm_num

  -- Therefore, the left-hand side of the equation becomes $5 + 50 = 55$.
  have : 5 + 500 / 100 * 10 = 55 := by linarith

  -- $110\%$ of $55$ is $1.1 \cdot 55 = 60.5$.
  have : 110 / 100 * x = 60.5 := by linarith

  -- Solving for $x$, we get $x = \frac{60.5}{1.1} = 55$.
  have : x = 55 := by linarith

  -- But $55 \neq 50$, so the original equation has no solution.
