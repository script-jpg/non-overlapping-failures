In this Lean 4 proof, we're given the equation $5 + 500\% \text{ of } 10 = 110\% \text{ of } x$, which translates to $5 + 500/100 \cdot 10 = 110/100 \cdot x$.

1. First, we need to simplify the left-hand side: $5 + 500/100 \cdot 10 = 5 + 5 \cdot 10 = 5 + 50 = 55$.
2. The equation becomes $55 = 110/100 \cdot x$.
3. To solve for $x$, multiply both sides by $100/110$ to isolate $x$: $x = 55 \cdot (100/110) = 55 \cdot (10/11) = 50$.
4. Therefore, $x = 50$.

The Lean proof uses `ring_nf` to normalize the arithmetic expression, and then `linarith` to solve the resulting linear arithmetic goal directly. This demonstrates the power of Lean's automation for solving straightforward algebraic equations.

The key insight is that $5 + 500\% \text{ of } 10 = 5 + 5 \cdot 10 = 55$, and $55 = 110\% \text{ of } x$ implies $x = 55 \cdot (100/110) = 50$.
