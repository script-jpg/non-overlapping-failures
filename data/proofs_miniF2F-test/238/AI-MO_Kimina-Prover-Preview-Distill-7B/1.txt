-- $500\%$ of $10$ is $500\times 0.1 = 50$. This is similar to the $200\%$ of $10$ in the [ previous problem](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/200%20_of_10).
  have : 500 / 100 * 10 = 50 := by norm_num
  rw [this] at h₀
  -- Now we have $55 = 1.1x$.
  have : 5 + 50 = 1.1 * x := by rify; exact h₀
  rw [← this]
  -- To get $x$ by itself, we divide both sides by $1.1$, to get $x = \frac{55}{1.1} = 50$.
