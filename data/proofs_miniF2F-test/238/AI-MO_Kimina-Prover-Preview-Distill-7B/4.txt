-- $500\%$ of $10$ is $50$. This is because $10$ is the same as $100\%$ of $10$, so $500\%$ of $10$ is $500\%$ of $10$.

  -- So, we are trying to find the number $x$ such that $5 + 50 = 1.1x$.

  -- $5 + 50 = 55$, and so $55 = 1.1x$.

  -- To solve for $x$, we can divide both sides by $1.1$, getting $x = \frac{55}{1.1} = 50$.
