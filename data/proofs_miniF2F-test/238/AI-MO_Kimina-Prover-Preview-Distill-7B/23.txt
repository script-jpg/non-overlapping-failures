The Lean 4 solution is remarkably concise because the arithmetic involved is straightforward. We need to solve the equation:
\[ 5 + 500\% \text{ of } 10 = 110\% \text{ of } x \]
which translates to:
\[ 5 + \frac{500}{100} \times 10 = \frac{110}{100} \times x \]

Let's compute the left side:
\[ 5 + \frac{500}{100} \times 10 = 5 + 5 \times 10 = 5 + 50 = 55 \]

So we have:
\[ 55 = \frac{110}{100} \times x \]
\[ 55 = 1.1 \times x \]

To solve for $x$, divide both sides by 1.1:
\[ x = \frac{55}{1.1} = 50 \]

We start by importing the necessary libraries and setting up the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_400 (x : ℝ) (h₀ : 5 + 500 / 100 * 10 = 110 / 100 * x) : x = 50 := by
```

Our goal is to prove that $x = 50$ given the equation $5 + \frac{500}{100} \times 10 = \frac{110}{100} \times x$.

Let's compute the left side of the equation:
- $500\%$ of $10$ is $\frac{500}{100} \times 10 = 5 \times 10 = 50$
- So $5 + 50 = 55$

The right side is $\frac{110}{100} \times x = 1.1 \times x$

Equating both sides:
$55 = 1.1 \times x$
$x = \frac{55}{1.1} = 50$

In Lean, we can solve this directly using linear arithmetic:

```tactics

The Lean tactic `linarith` is powerful enough to solve linear arithmetic goals. It will:
1. Compute the left side: $5 + \frac{500}{100} \times 10 = 5 + 50 = 55$
2. Set up the equation $55 = \frac{110}{100} \times x$
3. Solve for $x$ by multiplying both sides by $\frac{100}{110}$ to get $x = 55 \times \frac{100}{110} = 50$
4. Verify that $x = 50$ satisfies the original equation

Therefore, the complete Lean proof is simply `linarith`, which confirms that $x = 50$ is indeed the solution to the given equation.
