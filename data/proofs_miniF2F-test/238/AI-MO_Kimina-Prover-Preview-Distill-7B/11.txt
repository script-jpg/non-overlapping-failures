The theorem states that if $5 + 500\%$ of $10$ equals $110\%$ of some number $x$, then $x = 50$. Let's break down the proof:

1. First, we need to translate the problem into an equation. 
   - $500\%$ of $10$ means $\frac{500}{100} \times 10 = 5 \times 10 = 50$.
   - $110\%$ of $x$ means $\frac{110}{100} \times x = 1.1x$.
   - So the equation is $5 + 50 = 1.1x$, or $55 = 1.1x$.

2. In Lean, we start by importing the necessary libraries and setting up the theorem statement:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

```

3. Now we can state the theorem:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_400 (x : ℝ) (h₀ : 5 + 500 / 100 * 10 = 110 / 100 * x) : x = 50 := by
```

4. The equation $5 + 500\% \cdot 10 = 110\% \cdot x$ becomes $5 + 5 \cdot 10 = 1.1 \cdot x$ which simplifies to $55 = 1.1 \cdot x$.

5. Solving for $x$, we get $x = \frac{55}{1.1} = 50$.

6. In Lean, we can use `linarith` to solve linear arithmetic goals. The `ring_nf` tactic will normalize the numerical expressions in our hypothesis:

```tactics
ring_nf at h₀
```

7. After normalization, `h₀` should represent the equation $55 = 1.1 \cdot x$. The `linarith` tactic can solve for $x$:

```tactics
linarith
```

8. The `linarith` tactic will deduce that $x = 50$ from the equation $55 = 1.1 \cdot x$.

Therefore, the complete proof shows that if $5 + 500\%$ of $10$ equals $110\%$ of $x$, then $x = 50$.
