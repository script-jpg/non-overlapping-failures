    _ = 5 + 5 * 10 := by norm_num -- Simplifying the percentage multiplication
    _ = 5 + 50 := by norm_num -- Calculating 5 * 10
    _ = 55 := by norm_num -- Adding 5 + 50
    _ = 110 / 100 * 50 := by norm_num -- Showing 55 as a percentage of 50
    _ = _ := by rw [h₀] -- Using the given hypothesis to complete the proof
