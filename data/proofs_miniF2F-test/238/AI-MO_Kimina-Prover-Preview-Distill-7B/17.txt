-- The equation simplifies to $x = \frac{5 + 500/100 \cdot 10 \cdot 100}{110} = 50$.

This completes the proof. The key insight is that $5 + 500\%$ of $10$ means $5 + 5 \cdot 10 = 5 + 50 = 55$. And $110\%$ of $x$ is $1.1x$. Setting these equal: $55 = 1.1x$, so $x = \frac{55}{1.1} = 50$. The Lean proof directly solves this equation using `linarith`.
