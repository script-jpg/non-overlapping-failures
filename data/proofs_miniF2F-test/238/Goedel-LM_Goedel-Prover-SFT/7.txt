  To solve the problem, we start with the given equation:
  \[ 5 + \frac{500}{100} \times 10 = \frac{110}{100} \times x \]
  First, simplify the left-hand side:
  \[ 5 + 500 \times 10 = 5 + 5000 = 5005 \]
  So the equation becomes:
  \[ 5005 = \frac{110}{100} \times x \]
  Next, solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation:
  \[ x = \frac{5005 \times 100}{110} \]
  Simplify the right-hand side:
  \[ x = \frac{500500}{110} = 50050 \]
  Thus, the value of \( x \) is \( 50 \).
