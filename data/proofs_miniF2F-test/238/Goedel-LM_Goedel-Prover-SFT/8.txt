  To solve the equation \(5 + 500\% \text{ of } 10 = 110\% \text{ of } x\), we start by simplifying the left-hand side. Given that \(500\%\) of \(10\) is \(500 \times 10 / 100 = 50\), the equation becomes \(5 + 50 = 110\% \text{ of } x\). Simplifying further, we get \(55 = 110\% \text{ of } x\). To isolate \(x\), we divide both sides by 110% (which is equivalent to dividing by 1.1), yielding \(x = 50\).
