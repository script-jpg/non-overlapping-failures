  To solve the equation \(5 + \frac{500}{100} \cdot 10 = \frac{110}{100} \cdot x\), we first simplify the left-hand side to \(5 + 50 = 55\). This gives us the equation \(55 = \frac{110}{100} \cdot x\). To solve for \(x\), we multiply both sides by 100 to clear the fraction, resulting in \(5500 = 110 \cdot x\). Finally, we divide both sides by 110 to isolate \(x\), yielding \(x = 50\).
