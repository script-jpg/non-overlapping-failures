  To solve the problem, we start with the given equation:
  \[ 5 + \frac{500}{100} \times 10 = \frac{110}{100} \times x \]
  First, simplify the left-hand side:
  \[ 5 + 5 \times 10 = 5 + 50 = 55 \]
  So the equation becomes:
  \[ 55 = \frac{110}{100} \times x \]
  Next, simplify the right-hand side:
  \[ \frac{110}{100} \times x = \frac{11}{10} \times x \]
  Thus, the equation is:
  \[ 55 = \frac{11}{10} \times x \]
  To solve for \( x \), multiply both sides by the reciprocal of \( \frac{11}{10} \):
  \[ x = 55 \times \frac{10}{11} \]
  Calculate the right-hand side:
  \[ x = 55 \times \frac{10}{11} = 55 \times \frac{10}{11} = 5 \times \frac{10}{1} = 5 \times 10 = 50 \]
  Therefore, the value of \( x \) is \( 50 \).

    -- Simplify the right-hand side:
    -- 110 / 100 * x = 11 / 10 * x
    -- Thus, the equation is:
    -- 55 = 11 / 10 * x
    -- To solve for x, multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 11 / 10:
    -- x = 55 * (10 / 11)

  -- Calculate the right-hand side:
  -- x = 55 * (10 / 11) = 55 * (10 / 11) = 5 * (10 / 1) = 5 * 10 = 50
  -- Therefore, the value of x is 50.
