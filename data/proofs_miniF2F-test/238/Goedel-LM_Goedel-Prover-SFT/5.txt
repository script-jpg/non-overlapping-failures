  To solve the equation \(5 + \frac{500}{100} \cdot 10 = \frac{110}{100} \cdot x\) and find the value of \(x\), we proceed as follows:
  1. Simplify the left-hand side of the equation:
     \[
     5 + \frac{500}{100} \cdot 10 = 5 + 5 \cdot 10 = 5 + 50 = 55
     \]
  2. Equate the simplified left-hand side to the right-hand side:
     \[
     55 = \frac{110}{100} \cdot x
     \]
  3. Solve for \(x\) by isolating \(x\) on one side of the equation:
     \[
     x = \frac{55 \cdot 100}{110} = \frac{5500}{110} = 50
     \]
  Thus, the value of \(x\) is \(50\).
