  To solve the problem, we start with the given equation:
  \[ 5 + \frac{500}{100} \cdot 10 = \frac{110}{100} \cdot x \]
  First, simplify the left-hand side:
  \[ 5 + 50 = \frac{110}{100} \cdot x \]
  This simplifies to:
  \[ 55 = \frac{110}{100} \cdot x \]
  Next, solve for \( x \) by isolating \( x \):
  \[ x = \frac{55 \cdot 100}{110} \]
  Simplify the right-hand side:
  \[ x = \frac{5500}{110} = 50 \]
  Thus, the value of \( x \) is \( 50 \).
