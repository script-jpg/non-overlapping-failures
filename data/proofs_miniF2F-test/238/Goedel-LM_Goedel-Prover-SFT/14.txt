  Given the equation \(5 + \frac{500}{100} \times 10 = \frac{110}{100} \times x\), we need to find the value of \(x\). First, simplify the left-hand side of the equation:
  \[ 5 + \frac{500}{100} \times 10 = 5 + 5 \times 10 = 5 + 50 = 55 \]
  Thus, the equation becomes:
  \[ 55 = \frac{110}{100} \times x \]
  Next, solve for \(x\) by isolating \(x\):
  \[ x = \frac{55 \times 100}{110} = \frac{5500}{110} = 50 \]
  Therefore, the value of \(x\) is \(50\).
