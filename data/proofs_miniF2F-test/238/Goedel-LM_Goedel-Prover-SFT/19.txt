  To solve the problem, we start by simplifying the given equation:
  \[ 5 + \frac{500}{100} \times 10 = \frac{110}{100} \times x \]
  First, simplify the left-hand side:
  \[ 5 + 5 \times 10 = 5 + 50 = 55 \]
  Thus, the equation becomes:
  \[ 55 = \frac{110}{100} \times x \]
  Next, simplify the right-hand side:
  \[ \frac{110}{100} \times x = 1.1 \times x \]
  So the equation is now:
  \[ 55 = 1.1 \times x \]
  To solve for \( x \), divide both sides by 1.1:
  \[ x = \frac{55}{1.1} \]
  Calculate the division:
  \[ x = 50 \]
  Thus, the number \( x \) that satisfies the given equation is \( 50 \).
