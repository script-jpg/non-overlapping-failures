  To solve the problem, we start with the given equation \( 5 + \frac{500}{100} \times 10 = \frac{110}{100} \times x \). Simplifying the left-hand side, we get \( 5 + 50 = \frac{110}{100} \times x \), which further simplifies to \( 55 = \frac{110}{100} \times x \). To isolate \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{100}{110} \) to solve for \( x \):
  \[ x = 55 \times \frac{100}{110} = 55 \times \frac{10}{11} = 50 \]
  Thus, the value of \( x \) is \( 50 \).
