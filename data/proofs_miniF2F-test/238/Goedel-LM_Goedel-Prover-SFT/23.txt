  To solve the problem, we start with the given equation: \( 5 + \frac{500}{100} \times 10 = \frac{110}{100} \times x \). First, we simplify the left-hand side of the equation. We calculate \(\frac{500}{100} \times 10\), which simplifies to 50. Adding 5 to 50 gives us 55. Thus, the equation becomes \( 55 = \frac{110}{100} \times x \). Next, we solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by dividing both sides by \(\frac{110}{100}\), which is equivalent to multiplying by \(\frac{100}{110}\). This gives us \( x = 55 \times \frac{100}{110} \). Simplifying the right-hand side, we find \( x = 50 \).
