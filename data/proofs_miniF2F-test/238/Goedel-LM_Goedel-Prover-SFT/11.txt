  To solve the problem, we start by simplifying the given equation \( 5 + \frac{500}{100} \times 10 = \frac{110}{100} \times x \). First, simplify the fraction \( \frac{500}{100} \) to 5. Then, simplify the left-hand side of the equation to \( 5 + 5 \times 10 = 5 + 50 = 55 \). Thus, the equation becomes \( 55 = \frac{110}{100} \times x \). Next, simplify \( \frac{110}{100} \) to \( \frac{11}{10} \). So, the equation is \( 55 = \frac{11}{10} \times x \). To isolate \( x \), multiply both sides by \( \frac{10}{11} \) to solve for \( x \), yielding \( x = 55 \times \frac{10}{11} = 50 \).
