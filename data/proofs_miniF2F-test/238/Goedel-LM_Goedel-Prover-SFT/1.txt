  To show that five plus $500\%$ of $10$ is the same as $110\%$ of what number, we start with the equation \(5 + \frac{500}{100} \times 10 = \frac{110}{100} \times x\). Simplifying the left-hand side, we get \(5 + 50 = \frac{110}{100} \times x\). This simplifies further to \(55 = \frac{110}{100} \times x\). To solve for \(x\), we multiply both sides by \(\frac{100}{110}\) to isolate \(x\), yielding \(x = 50\).
