  To solve the problem, we start with the given equation:
  \[ 5 + \frac{500}{100} \cdot 10 = \frac{110}{100} \cdot x \]
  First, simplify the left-hand side:
  \[ 5 + 50 = \frac{110}{100} \cdot x \]
  \[ 55 = \frac{110}{100} \cdot x \]
  Next, simplify the right-hand side:
  \[ 55 = \frac{110}{100} \cdot x \]
  \[ 55 = 1.1 \cdot x \]
  To isolate \( x \), divide both sides by 1.1:
  \[ x = \frac{55}{1.1} \]
  \[ x = 50 \]
  Thus, the solution is \( x = 50 \).
