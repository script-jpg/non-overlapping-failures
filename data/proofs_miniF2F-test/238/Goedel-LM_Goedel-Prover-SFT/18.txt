  To solve the problem, we start with the given equation:
  \[ 5 + \frac{500}{100} \cdot 10 = \frac{110}{100} \cdot x \]
  First, simplify the left-hand side:
  \[ 5 + 500 = 110 \]
  Thus, the equation becomes:
  \[ 110 = \frac{110}{100} \cdot x \]
  Next, simplify the right-hand side:
  \[ 110 = \frac{11}{10} \cdot x \]
  To isolate \( x \), multiply both sides by the reciprocal of \(\frac{11}{10}\), which is \(\frac{10}{11}\):
  \[ x = 110 \cdot \frac{10}{11} \]
  Simplify the right-hand side:
  \[ x = 100 \]
  Thus, the solution to the equation is \( x = 50 \).

  -- We start with the given equation and simplify it step by step.
  have h₁ : 5 + 500 / 100 * 10 = 110 / 100 * x := h₀
  -- Simplify the left-hand side: 5 + 500 = 110
  -- This simplifies to: 110 = 110 / 100 * x
  -- Simplify the right-hand side: 110 = 11 / 10 * x
  -- To isolate x, multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 11 / 10, which is 10 / 11
