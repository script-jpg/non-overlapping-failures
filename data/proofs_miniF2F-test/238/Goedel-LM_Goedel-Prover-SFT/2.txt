  To solve the problem, we start with the given equation: \(5 + \frac{500}{100} \times 10 = \frac{110}{100} \times x\). Simplifying the left-hand side, we get: \(5 + 50 = \frac{110}{100} \times x\). This simplifies further to: \(55 = \frac{110}{100} \times x\). To isolate \(x\), we multiply both sides by 100 to clear the fraction: \(55 \times 100 = 110 \times x\). This gives us: \(5500 = 110 \times x\). Finally, we divide both sides by 110 to solve for \(x\): \(x = \frac{5500}{110} = 50\).
