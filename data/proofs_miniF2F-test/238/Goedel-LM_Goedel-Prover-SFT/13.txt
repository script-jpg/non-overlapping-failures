  To solve the given equation \(5 + \frac{500}{100} \cdot 10 = \frac{110}{100} \cdot x\) and show that \(x = 50\), we proceed as follows:
  1. Simplify the left-hand side of the equation:
     \[
     5 + \frac{500}{100} \cdot 10 = 5 + 5 \cdot 10 = 5 + 50 = 55
     \]
  2. Equate the simplified left-hand side to the right-hand side of the given equation:
     \[
     55 = \frac{110}{100} \cdot x
     \]
  3. Solve for \(x\) by multiplying both sides by \(100 / 110\):
     \[
     x = 55 \cdot \frac{100}{110} = 55 \cdot \frac{10}{11} = 5 \cdot 10 = 50
     \]
