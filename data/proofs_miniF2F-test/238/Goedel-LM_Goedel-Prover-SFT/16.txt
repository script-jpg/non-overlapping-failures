  Given the equation \( 5 + \frac{500}{100} \times 10 = \frac{110}{100} \times x \), we need to show that \( x = 50 \).
  First, simplify the left-hand side of the equation:
  \[ 5 + \frac{500}{100} \times 10 = 5 + 5 \times 10 = 5 + 50 = 55 \]
  Thus, the equation becomes:
  \[ 55 = \frac{110}{100} \times x \]
  Next, simplify the right-hand side of the equation:
  \[ \frac{110}{100} \times x = 1.1x \]
  So, the equation is now:
  \[ 55 = 1.1x \]
  To solve for \( x \), divide both sides by 1.1:
  \[ x = \frac{55}{1.1} = 50 \]
  Therefore, \( x = 50 \).
