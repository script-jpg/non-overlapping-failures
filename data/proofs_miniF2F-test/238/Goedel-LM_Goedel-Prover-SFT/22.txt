  To solve the problem, we start by simplifying the given equation \(5 + \frac{500}{100} \cdot 10 = \frac{110}{100} \cdot x\). First, we simplify the left-hand side of the equation:
  \[
  5 + \frac{500}{100} \cdot 10 = 5 + 5 \cdot 10 = 5 + 50 = 55
  \]
  Thus, the equation becomes:
  \[
  55 = \frac{110}{100} \cdot x
  \]
  Next, we solve for \(x\) by isolating it on one side of the equation. Multiplying both sides by \(\frac{100}{110}\) gives:
  \[
  x = 55 \cdot \frac{100}{110} = 55 \cdot \frac{10}{11} = 5 \cdot 10 = 50
  \]
  Therefore, the value of \(x\) is \(50\).
