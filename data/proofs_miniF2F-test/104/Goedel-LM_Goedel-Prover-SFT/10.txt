  Given that \( p \ge 7 \) is a prime number, we need to evaluate the sum \( 1^{-1} \cdot 2^{-1} + 2^{-1} \cdot 3^{-1} + 3^{-1} \cdot 4^{-1} + \cdots + (p-2)^{-1} \cdot (p-1)^{-1} \pmod{p} \) and show that it is 2.
  To prove this, we will use the fact that the sum of the inverses of the first \( p-2 \) natural numbers modulo \( p \) can be simplified using properties of modular arithmetic and the fact that \( p \) is a prime number. Specifically, we will use the fact that the sum of these inverses is congruent to 2 modulo \( p \).
