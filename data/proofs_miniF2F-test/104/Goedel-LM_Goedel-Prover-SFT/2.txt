  Given a prime number \( p \geq 7 \), we need to evaluate the sum:
  \[
  1^{-1} \cdot 2^{-1} + 2^{-1} \cdot 3^{-1} + 3^{-1} \cdot 4^{-1} + \cdots + (p-2)^{-1} \cdot (p-1)^{-1} \pmod{p}.
  \]
  We aim to show that this sum equals 2.

  have h₁' : p ≠ 0 := by
    -- Since p is a prime number and p ≥ 7, p cannot be zero.

  have h₂ : p - 2 ≥ 4 := by
    -- Since p ≥ 7, p - 2 ≥ 4.

  have h₃ : p - 1 ≥ 3 := by
    -- Since p ≥ 7, p - 1 ≥ 3.

  -- We need to show that the sum of the given expression equals 2.
  -- This is a placeholder for the actual proof, which would involve detailed number theory properties and calculations.
