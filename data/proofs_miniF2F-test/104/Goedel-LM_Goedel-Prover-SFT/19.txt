  Given that \( p \ge 7 \) is a prime number, we need to evaluate the sum:
  \[ 1^{-1} \cdot 2^{-1} + 2^{-1} \cdot 3^{-1} + 3^{-1} \cdot 4^{-1} + \cdots + (p-2)^{-1} \cdot (p-1)^{-1} \pmod{p}. \]
  We will show that this sum is 2.

  -- First, we evaluate the sum modulo p.
  have h : ∀ k : ℕ, k ∈ Finset.Icc 1 (p - 2) →
    (k : ZMod p)⁻¹ * ((k : ZMod p) + 1)⁻¹ = 2 := by
    -- For each k in the range, we need to show that the product of the modular inverses equals 2.

    -- Since p is a prime and k is in the range, we can use properties of modular arithmetic.
    have h₁ : (k : ZMod p) ≠ 0 := by
      -- k is not zero because it is in the range and p is at least 7.

    -- Using the fact that the product of the inverses equals 2, we can conclude.
