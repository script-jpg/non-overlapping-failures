  Given positive real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(b \leq a\), we need to show that:
  \[
  \frac{a + b}{2} - \sqrt{ab} \leq \frac{(a - b)^2}{8b}
  \]
  To prove this, we start by considering the inequality:
  \[
  \frac{a + b}{2} - \sqrt{ab} \leq \frac{(a - b)^2}{8b}
  \]
  We can rewrite this inequality as:
  \[
  \frac{a + b}{2} - \sqrt{ab} \leq \frac{(a - b)^2}{8b}
  \]
  To proceed, we use the fact that the square root of the product \(ab\) is non-negative and apply algebraic manipulations to show that the left-hand side is indeed less than or equal to the right-hand side.

  -- We use `nlinarith` to handle the algebraic manipulations and inequalities.
  -- `sq_sqrt` is used to ensure that the square root is non-negative.
  -- `sq_nonneg` is used to assert that the square of any real number is non-negative.
