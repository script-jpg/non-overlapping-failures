  Given positive real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(b \leq a\), we need to show that:
  \[
  \frac{a + b}{2} - \sqrt{ab} \leq \frac{(a - b)^2}{8b}
  \]
  First, we note that since \(a\) and \(b\) are positive, the square root of their product is also positive. We start by rewriting the inequality in a form that allows us to use algebraic manipulations and known inequalities. Specifically, we will use the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative, which will help us in proving the desired inequality.

  have h₂ : 0 < a * b := by
    -- Since a and b are positive, their product is also positive.
    exact mul_pos h₀.1 h₀.2
  have h₃ : 0 < Real.sqrt (a * b) := by
    -- The square root of a positive number is positive.
    exact Real.sqrt_pos.mpr h₂
  have h₄ : (a + b) / 2 - Real.sqrt (a * b) ≤ (a - b) ^ 2 / (8 * b) := by
    -- We rewrite the inequality in a form that allows us to use algebraic manipulations.
    -- Specifically, we use the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative.

      sq_nonneg (a - b),
      sq_nonneg (a + b),
      sq_nonneg (a + b - 2 * Real.sqrt (a * b))]
  -- Finally, we use linear arithmetic to conclude the proof.
