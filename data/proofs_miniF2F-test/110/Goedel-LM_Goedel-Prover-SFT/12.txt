  Given positive real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(b \leq a\), we need to show that:
  \[
  \frac{a + b}{2} - \sqrt{ab} \leq \frac{(a - b)^2}{8b}
  \]
  First, we establish that \(0 < a\) and \(0 < b\) using the given conditions. We then use the fact that the square root of the product of \(a\) and \(b\) is non-negative. By applying algebraic manipulations and the non-negativity of the square root, we can derive the desired inequality.

  -- Establish that a and b are positive.
  have h₂ : 0 < a := by linarith
  have h₃ : 0 < b := by linarith
  -- Use the non-negativity of the square root of the product of a and b.
  have h₄ : 0 ≤ Real.sqrt (a * b) := Real.sqrt_nonneg (a * b)
  -- Apply algebraic manipulations and the non-negativity of the square root to derive the inequality.
  nlinarith [sq_sqrt (mul_nonneg h₂.le h₃.le), sq_nonneg (a - b), sq_nonneg (a + b),
    sq_nonneg (a - b + Real.sqrt (a * b)), sq_nonneg (a - b - Real.sqrt (a * b))]
