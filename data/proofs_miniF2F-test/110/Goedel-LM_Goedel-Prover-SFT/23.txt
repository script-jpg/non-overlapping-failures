  Given positive real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(b \leq a\), we need to show that:
  \[
  \frac{a + b}{2} - \sqrt{ab} \leq \frac{(a - b)^2}{8b}
  \]
  To prove this inequality, we start by considering the non-negativity of certain expressions involving \(a\) and \(b\). Specifically, we use the fact that the square root of a product is non-negative and the square of a real number is non-negative. We then apply algebraic manipulations and inequalities to derive the desired result.

  have h₂ : 0 ≤ Real.sqrt (a * b) := Real.sqrt_nonneg (a * b)
  -- We also note that the square of any real number is non-negative.
  have h₃ : 0 ≤ (a - b) ^ 2 := sq_nonneg (a - b)
  -- We use the non-negativity of the square root and the square to derive the inequality.
