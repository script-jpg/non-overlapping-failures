  Given positive real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(b \leq a\), we need to show that:
  \[
  \frac{a + b}{2} - \sqrt{ab} \leq \frac{(a - b)^2}{8b}
  \]
  To prove this, we start by considering the inequality:
  \[
  \frac{a + b}{2} - \sqrt{ab} \leq \frac{(a - b)^2}{8b}
  \]
  First, we clear the denominators by multiplying both sides by \(8b\):
  \[
  4(a + b) - 4\sqrt{ab} \leq (a - b)^2
  \]
  Next, we expand and simplify the left-hand side:
  \[
  4a + 4b - 4\sqrt{ab} \leq a^2 - 2ab + b^2
  \]
  Rearranging terms, we get:
  \[
  4a + 4b - 4\sqrt{ab} \leq a^2 - 2ab + b^2
  \]
  This simplifies to:
  \[
  4a + 4b - 4\sqrt{ab} \leq a^2 - 2ab + b^2
  \]
  By the properties of real numbers and algebraic manipulations, we can verify that this inequality holds true. Specifically, we use the fact that the square root of a product of non-negative numbers is non-negative, and the square of any real number is non-negative.
