  Given positive real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(b \leq a\), we need to show that:
  \[
  \frac{a + b}{2} - \sqrt{ab} \leq \frac{(a - b)^2}{8b}
  \]
  First, we establish that \(a\) and \(b\) are positive, \(b\) is non-negative, and \(a\) is non-negative. We then use the fact that the square root of the product \(ab\) is non-negative and apply algebraic manipulations and inequalities to prove the desired result.
