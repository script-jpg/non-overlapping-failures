  Given positive real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(b \leq a\), we need to show that \(\frac{a + b}{2} - \sqrt{ab} \leq \frac{(a - b)^2}{8b}\).
  1. **Non-negativity of the square root**: Since \(a\) and \(b\) are positive, \(a \cdot b\) is non-negative. Therefore, \(\sqrt{ab} \geq 0\).
  2. **Non-negativity of the expression**: We need to show that \(\frac{a + b}{2} - \sqrt{ab} \leq \frac{(a - b)^2}{8b}\). This can be rewritten as:
     \[
     \frac{a + b}{2} - \sqrt{ab} \leq \frac{(a - b)^2}{8b}
     \]
     By simplifying and using the fact that \(b \leq a\), we can apply algebraic manipulations and inequalities to verify the non-negativity of the left-hand side.
  3. **Applying algebraic inequalities**: Using the properties of squares and the given inequalities \(a \geq b > 0\), we can derive the desired inequality. Specifically, we use the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative, which helps in proving the inequality.
