  Given positive real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(b \leq a\), we need to show that \(\frac{a+b}{2} - \sqrt{ab} \leq \frac{(a-b)^2}{8b}\).
  1. Start by noting that since \(a\) and \(b\) are positive, \(a \cdot b\) is also positive.
  2. The square root of a positive number is non-negative, so \(\sqrt{ab} \geq 0\).
  3. Use the inequality \(\frac{a+b}{2} - \sqrt{ab} \leq \frac{(a-b)^2}{8b}\) by applying algebraic manipulations and using non-negative properties of squares.

  -- Since a and b are positive, a * b is also positive.
  have h₂ : 0 < a * b := mul_pos h₀.1 h₀.2
  -- The square root of a positive number is non-negative.
  have h₃ : 0 ≤ Real.sqrt (a * b) := Real.sqrt_nonneg (a * b)
  -- Use algebraic manipulations and non-negative properties of squares to prove the inequality.
