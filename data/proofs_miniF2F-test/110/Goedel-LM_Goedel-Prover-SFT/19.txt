  Given positive real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(b \leq a\), we need to show that:
  \[
  \frac{a + b}{2} - \sqrt{ab} \leq \frac{(a - b)^2}{8b}
  \]
  First, we note that since \(a\) and \(b\) are positive, \(a \cdot b\) is also positive. We start by rewriting the inequality in a more manageable form. We use the fact that the square root of a product can be expressed in terms of squares and products, and we simplify the expression using algebraic manipulations and inequalities. Specifically, we use the non-negativity of squares and the properties of real numbers to derive the desired inequality.

  have h₃ : 0 ≤ (a - b) ^ 2 := sq_nonneg (a - b)
  -- The square of any real number is non-negative.
  have h₄ : 0 ≤ (a + b) ^ 2 := sq_nonneg (a + b)
  -- Similarly, the square of (a + b) is non-negative.
  have h₅ : 0 ≤ (a - b) ^ 2 := sq_nonneg (a - b)
  -- The square of (a - b) is non-negative.
  have h₆ : 0 ≤ (a + b) ^ 2 := sq_nonneg (a + b)
  -- The square of (a + b) is non-negative.
