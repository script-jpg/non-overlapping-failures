  Given positive real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(b \leq a\), we need to show that:
  \[
  \frac{a + b}{2} - \sqrt{ab} \leq \frac{(a - b)^2}{8b}
  \]
  To prove this, we start by noting that the square root of the product \(ab\) is non-negative. We then use algebraic manipulations and inequalities to show that the left-hand side is indeed less than or equal to the right-hand side. Specifically, we use the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative, which allows us to apply the inequality involving squares and square roots.

  -- We start by noting that the square root of the product `a * b` is non-negative.
  have h₂ : 0 ≤ Real.sqrt (a * b) := Real.sqrt_nonneg (a * b)
  -- We use the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative to establish inequalities.
  have h₃ : 0 ≤ (a - b) ^ 2 := sq_nonneg (a - b)
  have h₄ : 0 ≤ (a + b) / 2 - Real.sqrt (a * b) := by
    -- We use `nlinarith` to handle the algebraic inequalities involving squares and square roots.
    nlinarith [sq_sqrt (mul_nonneg h₀.1.le h₀.2.le), sq_nonneg (a - b)]
  -- Finally, we use `nlinarith` to combine all the inequalities and conclude the proof.
  nlinarith [sq_sqrt (mul_nonneg h₀.1.le h₀.2.le), h₁, sq_nonneg (a - b)]
