  Given positive real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(b \leq a\), we aim to show that:
  \[
  \frac{a + b}{2} - \sqrt{ab} \leq \frac{(a - b)^2}{8b}
  \]
  To prove this, we start by considering the inequality:
  \[
  \frac{a + b}{2} - \sqrt{ab} \leq \frac{(a - b)^2}{8b}
  \]
  We can rewrite this inequality as:
  \[
  \frac{a + b - 2\sqrt{ab}}{2} \leq \frac{(a - b)^2}{8b}
  \]
  Multiplying both sides by \(8b\) to clear the denominator on the right-hand side, we get:
  \[
  4(a + b - 2\sqrt{ab}) \leq (a - b)^2
  \]
  Expanding and simplifying the left-hand side, we have:
  \[
  4a + 4b - 8\sqrt{ab} \leq a^2 - 2ab + b^2
  \]
  Rearranging terms, we get:
  \[
  a^2 + b^2 - 4a - 4b + 8\sqrt{ab} \leq 0
  \]
  This inequality can be verified using non-linear arithmetic (nlinarith), considering the non-negativity of squares and the properties of real numbers. Specifically, we use the fact that the square root of a product of non-negative numbers is non-negative, and the square of any real number is non-negative.
