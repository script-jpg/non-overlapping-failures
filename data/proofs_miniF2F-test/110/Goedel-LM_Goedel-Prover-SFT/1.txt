  Given positive real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(b \leq a\), we need to show that:
  \[
  \frac{a + b}{2} - \sqrt{ab} \leq \frac{(a - b)^2}{8b}
  \]
  To prove this, we start by noting that the square root of the product \(ab\) is non-negative. We then use the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative to establish a lower bound for the expression. Specifically, we use the inequality involving the square of the difference of \(a\) and \(b\) and the square root of \(ab\) to derive the desired inequality.
