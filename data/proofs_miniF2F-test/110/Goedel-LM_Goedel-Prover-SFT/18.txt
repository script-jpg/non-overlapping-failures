  Given positive real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(b \leq a\), we need to show that:
  \[
  \frac{a + b}{2} - \sqrt{ab} \leq \frac{(a - b)^2}{8b}
  \]
  1. Start by noting that \((a - b)^2 \geq 0\) since the square of any real number is non-negative.
  2. Use the fact that \(\sqrt{ab} \leq \frac{a + b}{2}\) (which follows from the inequality involving the arithmetic mean and the geometric mean).
  3. Combine these inequalities to derive the desired result.

  -- We start by noting that the square of any real number is non-negative.
  have h₂ : 0 ≤ (a - b) ^ 2 := sq_nonneg (a - b)
  -- We also note that the square root of the product of two numbers is less than or equal to their arithmetic mean.
  have h₃ : Real.sqrt (a * b) ≤ (a + b) / 2 := by
    nlinarith [sq_sqrt (mul_nonneg h₀.1.le h₀.2.le), sq_nonneg (a - b)]
  -- Combining the above inequalities, we get the desired result.
