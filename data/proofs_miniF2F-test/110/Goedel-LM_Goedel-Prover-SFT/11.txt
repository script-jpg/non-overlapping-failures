  Given positive real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(b \leq a\), we need to show that:
  \[
  \frac{a + b}{2} - \sqrt{ab} \leq \frac{(a - b)^2}{8b}
  \]
  To prove this, we start by considering the inequality \(\frac{a + b}{2} - \sqrt{ab} \leq \frac{(a - b)^2}{8b}\). We will manipulate the left-hand side and compare it with the right-hand side.
  First, we rewrite the inequality:
  \[
  \frac{a + b}{2} - \sqrt{ab} \leq \frac{(a - b)^2}{8b}
  \]
  Next, we use the fact that \(b \leq a\) and the properties of real numbers to simplify the inequality. We can use algebraic manipulations and known inequalities to show that the left-hand side is indeed less than or equal to the right-hand side.
