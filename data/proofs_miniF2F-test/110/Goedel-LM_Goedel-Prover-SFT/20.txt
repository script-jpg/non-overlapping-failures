  Given positive real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(b \leq a\), we need to show that:
  \[
  \frac{a + b}{2} - \sqrt{ab} \leq \frac{(a - b)^2}{8b}
  \]
  1. **Non-negativity of the square root**: Since \(a\) and \(b\) are positive, the square root \(\sqrt{ab}\) is non-negative.
  2. **Non-negativity of the square of the difference**: The square of any real number is non-negative, hence \((a - b)^2 \geq 0\).
  3. **Non-negativity of the product**: The product of non-negative numbers is non-negative, so \(a \cdot b \geq 0\).
