  Given positive real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(b \leq a\), we need to show that:
  \[
  \frac{a + b}{2} - \sqrt{ab} \leq \frac{(a - b)^2}{8b}
  \]
  First, we establish that \(a\) and \(b\) are positive, ensuring that all operations are valid within the real numbers. We then use the fact that the square root of the product \(ab\) is non-negative and apply algebraic manipulations and inequalities to show the desired inequality.
