  Given positive real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(b \leq a\), we need to show that:
  \[
  \frac{a + b}{2} - \sqrt{ab} \leq \frac{(a - b)^2}{8b}
  \]
  To prove this, we start by considering the inequality:
  \[
  \frac{a + b}{2} - \sqrt{ab} \leq \frac{(a - b)^2}{8b}
  \]
  We can rewrite the left-hand side as:
  \[
  \frac{a + b}{2} - \sqrt{ab} = \frac{a + b - 2\sqrt{ab}}{2} = \frac{(a - b)^2}{2}
  \]
  Thus, the inequality becomes:
  \[
  \frac{(a - b)^2}{2} \leq \frac{(a - b)^2}{8b}
  \]
  Since \((a - b)^2 \geq 0\) for all real numbers \(a\) and \(b\), we can multiply both sides by \(2\) and \(8b\) to get:
  \[
  (a - b)^2 \leq \frac{(a - b)^2}{4b}
  \]
  This inequality holds because \(b \leq a\) implies \(0 \leq a - b \leq a\), and thus \((a - b)^2\) is non-negative and bounded by \(a^2\).
