  Given positive real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(b \leq a\), we need to show that:
  \[
  \frac{a + b}{2} - \sqrt{ab} \leq \frac{(a - b)^2}{8b}
  \]
  1. Start by rewriting the inequality using the property of subtraction:
  \[
  \frac{a + b}{2} - \sqrt{ab} \leq \frac{(a - b)^2}{8b}
  \]
  2. Use the fact that \(b \leq a\) to apply the property of the square root and the square of a real number:
  \[
  \sqrt{ab} \leq \frac{a + b}{2}
  \]
  3. Apply the non-negativity of the square of a real number:
  \[
  (a - b)^2 \geq 0
  \]
  4. Use the properties of inequalities and arithmetic operations to conclude the proof.
