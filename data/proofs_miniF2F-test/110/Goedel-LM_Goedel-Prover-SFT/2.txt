  Given positive real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(b \leq a\), we need to show that \(\frac{a+b}{2} - \sqrt{ab} \leq \frac{(a-b)^2}{8b}\).
  1. First, we establish that \(0 < a \cdot b\) because both \(a\) and \(b\) are positive.
  2. We then use the inequality \(\frac{a+b}{2} - \sqrt{ab} \leq \frac{(a-b)^2}{8b}\) by applying algebraic manipulations and the properties of non-negative numbers.
  3. Specifically, we use the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative, which helps in proving the inequality.
