  Given positive real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(b \leq a\), we need to show that:
  \[
  \frac{a + b}{2} - \sqrt{ab} \leq \frac{(a - b)^2}{8b}
  \]
  First, we note that since \(a\) and \(b\) are positive, \(a \cdot b\) is also positive. We start by considering the inequality:
  \[
  \frac{a + b}{2} - \sqrt{ab} \leq \frac{(a - b)^2}{8b}
  \]
  To prove this, we use the fact that the square root of a product of positive numbers is non-negative and apply algebraic manipulations to both sides of the inequality. Specifically, we use the property that the square root of a product is non-negative and the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative. We then use these properties to establish the inequality.

  -- The square root of a non-negative number is non-negative.
  have h₄ : 0 < b := by linarith
  -- Since b is positive, we have 0 < b.
  have h₅ : 0 < 8 * b := by linarith
  -- Since b is positive, 8 * b is positive.
  have h₆ : (a - b) ^ 2 ≥ 0 := sq_nonneg _
  -- The square of any real number is non-negative.
  have h₇ : (a + b) / 2 - Real.sqrt (a * b) ≤ (a - b) ^ 2 / (8 * b) := by
    -- We use the fact that the square root of a product is non-negative and apply algebraic manipulations.
