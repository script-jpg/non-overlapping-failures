  To determine how many positive integers \( n \) satisfy the equation \(\dfrac{n+1000}{70} = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor\), we start by analyzing the equation. The equation implies that the floor of the square root of \( n \) is the integer value of \(\dfrac{n+1000}{70}\).
  First, we simplify the equation:
  \[
  \dfrac{n+1000}{70} = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor
  \]
  Multiplying both sides by 70, we get:
  \[
  n + 1000 = 70 \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor
  \]
  Since \(\lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor\) is an integer, we can rewrite the equation as:
  \[
  n + 1000 = 70k \quad \text{for some integer } k
  \]
  Rearranging, we obtain:
  \[
  n = 70k - 1000
  \]
  For \( n \) to be a positive integer, \( k \) must be an integer greater than \(\frac{1000}{70} \approx 14.2857\). Therefore, \( k \) can be 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20.
  Calculating the corresponding values of \( n \):
  - For \( k = 15 \):
    \[
    n = 70 \cdot 15 - 1000 = 1050 - 1000 = 50
    \]
  - For \( k = 16 \):
    \[
    n = 70 \cdot 16 - 1000 = 1120 - 1000 = 120
    \]
  - For \( k = 17 \):
    \[
    n = 70 \cdot 17 - 1000 = 1190 - 1000 = 190
    \]
  - For \( k = 18 \):
    \[
    n = 70 \cdot 18 - 1000 = 1260 - 1000 = 260
    \]
  - For \( k = 19 \):
    \[
    n = 70 \cdot 19 - 1000 = 1330 - 1000 = 330
    \]
  - For \( k = 20 \):
    \[
    n = 70 \cdot 20 - 1000 = 1400 - 1000 = 400
    \]
  Thus, the values of \( n \) that satisfy the equation are \( 50, 120, 190, 260, 330, \) and \( 400 \). Counting these values, we find there are exactly 6 such integers.
