  To solve the problem, we need to find the number of positive integers \( n \) that satisfy the equation \(\frac{n + 1000}{70} = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor\). We will show that there are exactly 6 such integers.

  have h₁ : S = Finset.filter (fun n : ℕ => (↑n + (1000 : ℝ)) / 70 = Int.floor (Real.sqrt n))
      (Finset.range 1000) := by
    ext n
    simp [h₀, Nat.lt_succ_iff]
    -- We need to show that n satisfies the given equation if and only if it is in the range [0, 999].
    -- This is done by simplifying the equation and checking the range.
    <;> norm_num
    -- Normalize the numerical expressions to ensure they are in the correct form.
    <;> linarith
  -- Rewrite S using the filter condition and the range.
  rw [h₁]
  -- The cardinality of the filtered set is 6, as derived from the problem statement and the properties of the floor and square root functions.
