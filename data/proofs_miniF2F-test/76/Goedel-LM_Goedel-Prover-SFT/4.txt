  To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \( n \) that satisfy the equation \(\frac{n+1000}{70} = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor\). We will show that there are exactly 6 such integers.
  1. **Filtering the Set**: We filter the set of integers from 1 to 1000 to find those that satisfy the given equation.
  2. **Counting the Elements**: We count the number of elements in the filtered set.
