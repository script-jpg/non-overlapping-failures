  To determine how many positive integers \( n \) satisfy the equation \(\dfrac{n+1000}{70} = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor\), we start by analyzing the equation. The equation implies that \(\lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor\) is the greatest integer less than or equal to \(\sqrt{n}\).
  First, we solve the equation for \( n \):
  \[
  \dfrac{n+1000}{70} = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor
  \]
  Multiplying both sides by 70, we get:
  \[
  n + 1000 = 70 \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor
  \]
  Rearranging, we have:
  \[
  n = 70 \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor - 1000
  \]
  Next, we need to find the values of \( n \) that satisfy this equation. We will check the values of \( n \) by considering the possible values of \(\lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor\).
