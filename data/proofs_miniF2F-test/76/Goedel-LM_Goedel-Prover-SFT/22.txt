  To determine how many positive integers \( n \) satisfy the equation \(\dfrac{n+1000}{70} = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor\), we start by analyzing the given equation. The equation implies that \(\dfrac{n+1000}{70}\) must be an integer, which means \( n + 1000 \) must be a multiple of 70. We can express \( n \) as \( 70k - 1000 \) for some integer \( k \).
  Next, we need to find the values of \( k \) such that \( 70k - 1000 \) is a positive integer and \(\dfrac{70k - 1000 + 1000}{70} = \lfloor \sqrt{70k - 1000} \rfloor\). Simplifying, we get:
  \[
  \dfrac{70k}{70} = \lfloor \sqrt{70k - 1000} \rfloor
  \]
  \[
  k = \lfloor \sqrt{70k - 1000} \rfloor
  \]
  Since \( k \) must be an integer, we need to find the values of \( k \) that satisfy this equation. By testing values, we find that \( k \) can be 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19, corresponding to \( n = 70 \times 14 - 1000 = 980 \), \( n = 70 \times 15 - 1000 = 1050 \), \( n = 70 \times 16 - 1000 = 1120 \), \( n = 70 \times 17 - 1000 = 1190 \), \( n = 70 \times 18 - 1000 = 1260 \), and \( n = 70 \times 19 - 1000 = 1330 \).
  Thus, the positive integers \( n \) that satisfy the equation are 980, 1050, 1120, 1190, 1260, and 1330. Counting these, we find there are 6 such integers.
