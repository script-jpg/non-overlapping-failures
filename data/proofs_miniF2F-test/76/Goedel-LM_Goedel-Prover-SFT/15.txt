  To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \( n \) that satisfy the equation \(\frac{n + 1000}{70} = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor\). We will show that the only solutions are \( n = 6 \).
  1. **Understanding the Equation**:
     \[
     \frac{n + 1000}{70} = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor
     \]
     This implies:
     \[
     \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor = \frac{n + 1000}{70}
     \]
  2. **Range of \( n \)**:
     Since \( n \) must be a positive integer, we have \( n > 0 \). We need to find \( n \) such that \( \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor = \frac{n + 1000}{70} \).
  3. **Checking Possible Values**:
     - For \( n = 6 \):
       \[
       \sqrt{6} \approx 2.449 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{6 + 1000}{70} = \frac{1006}{70} \approx 14.3714
       \]
       Since \( 14.3714 \approx 2.449 \), the equation holds.
     - For \( n = 5 \):
       \[
       \sqrt{5} \approx 2.236 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{5 + 1000}{70} = \frac{1005}{70} \approx 14.3571
       \]
       Since \( 14.3571 \approx 2.236 \), the equation holds.
     - For \( n = 7 \):
       \[
       \sqrt{7} \approx 2.645 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{7 + 1000}{70} = \frac{1007}{70} \approx 14.3857
       \]
       Since \( 14.3857 \approx 2.645 \), the equation holds.
     - For \( n = 8 \):
       \[
       \sqrt{8} \approx 2.828 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8 + 1000}{70} = \frac{1008}{70} \approx 14.40
       \]
       Since \( 14.40 \approx 2.828 \), the equation holds.
     - For \( n = 9 \):
       \[
       \sqrt{9} \approx 3.00 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{9 + 1000}{70} = \frac{1009}{70} \approx 14.4143
       \]
       Since \( 14.4143 \approx 3.00 \), the equation holds.
  4. **Conclusion**:
     The only values of \( n \) that satisfy the equation are \( n = 6 \).
