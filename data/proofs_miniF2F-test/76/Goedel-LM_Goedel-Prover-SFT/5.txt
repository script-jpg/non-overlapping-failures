  To determine the number of positive integers \( n \) that satisfy the equation \(\frac{n+1000}{70} = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor\), we need to find the values of \( n \) for which the greatest integer less than or equal to \(\sqrt{n}\) is equal to \(\frac{n+1000}{70}\). This involves solving the equation and checking the integer values of \( n \) that satisfy it.

    -- We need to show that n satisfies the given conditions if and only if it is in the filtered set.
    -- This involves checking the conditions for each n in the range from 0 to 999.
    -- The filter function will keep only those n that satisfy the conditions.
    -- We then use the fact that the cardinality of the filtered set is 6.

  -- The cardinality of the set S is indeed 6.
