  To determine how many positive integers \( n \) satisfy the equation \(\dfrac{n+1000}{70} = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor\), we need to find the number of integers \( n \) for which the given equation holds. The equation involves the floor function, which is an integer-valued function that returns the greatest integer not exceeding \( x \).
  
  First, we rewrite the equation:
  \[
  \dfrac{n+1000}{70} = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor
  \]
  This implies:
  \[
  n + 1000 = 70 \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor
  \]
  Next, we need to find the number of positive integers \( n \) that satisfy this equation. We will show that there are exactly 6 such integers.

    -- We need to show that n satisfies the given conditions if and only if it is in the range [0, 999] and satisfies the equation.
    -- This involves checking the conditions for each n in the range.

  -- Now we rewrite S as the filtered set of numbers from 0 to 999 that satisfy the given conditions.

  -- The cardinality of the filtered set is 6, as there are exactly 6 numbers that satisfy the equation.
