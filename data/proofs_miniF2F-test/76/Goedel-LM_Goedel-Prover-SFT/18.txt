  To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \( n \) that satisfy the equation \(\dfrac{n+1000}{70} = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor\). We will show that there are exactly 6 such integers.

  have h₁ : S = Finset.filter (fun n : ℕ => 0 < n ∧ (↑n + (1000 : ℝ)) / 70 = Int.floor (Real.sqrt n)) (Finset.range 1000) := by
    ext n
    simp [h₀, Nat.lt_succ_iff]
    -- We need to show that n satisfies the given conditions if and only if it is in the range from 0 to 999.
    -- The conditions are:
    -- 1. n > 0
    -- 2. (n + 1000) / 70 = ⌊√n⌋
    -- We will use the given conditions to filter the range.
    omega
  rw [h₁]
  -- Now we rewrite S using the filter and the range.
