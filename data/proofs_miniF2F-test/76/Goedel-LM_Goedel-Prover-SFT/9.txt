  To determine how many positive integers \( n \) satisfy \(\dfrac{n+1000}{70} = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor\), we need to find the values of \( n \) for which the equation holds. This involves checking the values of \( n \) such that \(\lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor\) is an integer and matches the given fraction.
  1. **Understanding the Equation**:
     \[
     \dfrac{n+1000}{70} = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor
     \]
     This equation implies that \(\lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor\) must be an integer.
  2. **Range of \( n \)**:
     For \( n \) to be a positive integer, \(\sqrt{n}\) must be an integer. This means \( n \) must be a perfect square.
  3. **Finding Perfect Squares**:
     We need to find perfect squares \( n \) such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 1000 \). The perfect squares in this range are \( 1, 4, 9, 16, \ldots, 316 \).
  4. **Counting the Perfect Squares**:
     The sequence of perfect squares is \( 1^2, 2^2, 3^2, \ldots, 31^2 \) because \( 31^2 = 961 \) is the largest perfect square less than 1000.
     Thus, there are 31 perfect squares.
  5. **Verification**:
     We need to verify that for each \( n \) in the range, \(\dfrac{n+1000}{70}\) is an integer. This is true for all \( n \) that are perfect squares, and there are 31 such numbers.
