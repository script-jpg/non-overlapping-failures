  To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \( n \) that satisfy the equation \(\frac{n+1000}{70} = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor\). We will show that the number of such integers is 6.
  1. **Identify the range of \( n \)**:
     - From the equation \(\frac{n+1000}{70} = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor\), we know that \( n \) must be such that \(\lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor\) is an integer.
     - We need to find the range of \( n \) for which \(\lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor\) is an integer.
  2. **Determine the possible values of \( n \)**:
     - For \( n \) to be an integer, \(\sqrt{n}\) must be an integer.
     - The smallest integer \( \sqrt{n} \) can be is 1, since \( \sqrt{1} = 1 \).
     - The largest integer \( \sqrt{n} \) can be is 10, since \( \sqrt{100} = 10 \).
     - Therefore, \( n \) must be an integer in the range \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \).
  3. **Count the valid \( n \)**:
     - The integers \( n \) in the range \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \) that satisfy \(\frac{n+1000}{70} = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor\) are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, and 36.
     - There are 6 such integers.
  Thus, the number of positive integers \( n \) that satisfy the given equation is 6.

  -- We need to show that the cardinality of the set of integers n in the range 1 to 100 that satisfy the given equation is 6.
  -- The integers n that satisfy the equation are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, and 36.
  -- Therefore, the cardinality is 6.
