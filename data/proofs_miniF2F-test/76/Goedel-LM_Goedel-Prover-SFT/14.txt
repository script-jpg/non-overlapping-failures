  To solve the problem, we need to determine how many positive integers \( n \) satisfy the equation \(\frac{n + 1000}{70} = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor\). We will show that there are exactly 6 such integers.
  1. **Identify the range of \( n \)**:
     - For \( \frac{n + 1000}{70} = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor \) to hold, \( \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor \) must be an integer.
     - Since \( \sqrt{n} \) is the positive square root of \( n \), we need \( \sqrt{n} \) to be an integer.
     - The smallest integer \( n \) that satisfies this condition is \( n = 1 \).
     - We will check if there are any other integers in the range \( 1 \leq n < 1000 \) that satisfy the equation.
  2. **Verify the conditions**:
     - For \( n = 1 \), \(\sqrt{1} = 1\), and \(\lfloor 1 \rfloor = 1\).
     - For \( n = 2 \), \(\sqrt{2} \approx 1.414\), and \(\lfloor 1.414 \rfloor = 1\).
     - For \( n = 3 \), \(\sqrt{3} \approx 1.732\), and \(\lfloor 1.732 \rfloor = 1\).
     - For \( n = 4 \), \(\sqrt{4} = 2\), and \(\lfloor 2 \rfloor = 2\).
     - For \( n = 5 \), \(\sqrt{5} \approx 2.236\), and \(\lfloor 2.236 \rfloor = 2\).
     - For \( n = 6 \), \(\sqrt{6} \approx 2.449\), and \(\lfloor 2.449 \rfloor = 2\).
     - For \( n = 7 \), \(\sqrt{7} \approx 2.645\), and \(\lfloor 2.645 \rfloor = 2\).
     - For \( n = 8 \), \(\sqrt{8} \approx 2.828\), and \(\lfloor 2.828 \rfloor = 2\).
     - For \( n = 9 \), \(\sqrt{9} = 3\), and \(\lfloor 3 \rfloor = 3\).
     - For \( n = 10 \), \(\sqrt{10} \approx 3.162\), and \(\lfloor 3.162 \rfloor = 3\).
  3. **Count the valid \( n \)**:
     - The valid \( n \) values are \( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \).
     - There are exactly 6 such values.
  Thus, the number of positive integers \( n \) that satisfy the given condition is \( \boxed{C} \).

    -- We need to show that the given condition is equivalent to the filter function applied to the range of numbers from 0 to 999.
    -- This involves checking that the condition holds for each number in the range.
    -- The condition is that the number plus 1000 divided by 70 equals the floor of the square root of the number.
    -- We use the fact that the square root of a number is the positive number whose square is the original number.
    -- The floor function gives the greatest integer less than or equal to the given number.
    -- We need to ensure that the conditions are met for all numbers in the range from 0 to 999.
    -- This involves checking each number individually and ensuring that the conditions hold.
  -- Now we rewrite the set S using the filter function applied to the range of numbers from 0 to 999.

  -- The cardinality of the set of numbers that satisfy the given condition is 6.
