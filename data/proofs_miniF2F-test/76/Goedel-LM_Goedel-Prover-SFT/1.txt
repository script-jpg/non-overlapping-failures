  To determine how many positive integers \( n \) satisfy the equation \(\dfrac{n+1000}{70} = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor\), we need to find the integers \( n \) for which the floor of the square root of \( n \) is equal to \(\dfrac{n+1000}{70}\).
  First, we simplify the given equation:
  \[
  \dfrac{n+1000}{70} = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor
  \]
  Multiplying both sides by 70, we get:
  \[
  n + 1000 = 70 \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor
  \]
  Next, we need to find the values of \( n \) such that \( \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor \) is an integer. This implies that \( \sqrt{n} \) must be an integer, which is not possible for all integers \( n \). Therefore, we need to find specific values of \( n \) that satisfy this condition.
  By examining the equation, we can see that for \( n \) to be an integer, \( \sqrt{n} \) must be an integer. This is only possible for \( n \) being a perfect square. We need to find the perfect squares that satisfy the given conditions.
  Given the constraints, we find that the only perfect squares that satisfy the equation are \( n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 \) and \( n = 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121, 144, 169, 196, 225, 256, 289, 324, 361, 400, 441, 484, 529, 576, 625, 676, 729, 784, 841, 900, 961 \).
  Counting these values, we find there are 6 such perfect squares. Therefore, the number of positive integers \( n \) that satisfy the given equation is 6.
