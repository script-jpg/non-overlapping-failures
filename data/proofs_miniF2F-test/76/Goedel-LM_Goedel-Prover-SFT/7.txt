  To determine how many positive integers \( n \) satisfy the equation \(\dfrac{n+1000}{70} = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor\), we start by analyzing the given equation. The equation implies that \( n \) must be such that the floor of the square root of \( n \) is equal to the quotient of \( n + 1000 \) divided by 70. 
  First, we simplify the equation:
  \[
  \dfrac{n+1000}{70} = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor
  \]
  Multiplying both sides by 70, we get:
  \[
  n + 1000 = 70 \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor
  \]
  Rearranging, we have:
  \[
  n + 1000 = 70 \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor \implies n = 70 \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor - 1000
  \]
  For \( n \) to be a positive integer, \( 70 \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor - 1000 \) must be a positive integer. This implies:
  \[
  70 \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor > 1000 \implies \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor > \frac{1000}{70} \approx 14.2857
  \]
  Since \( \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor \) is an integer, the smallest possible value for \( \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor \) is 15. Therefore, the smallest \( n \) that satisfies the equation is:
  \[
  n = 70 \cdot 15 - 1000 = 1050 - 1000 = 50
  \]
  Next, we need to find the largest \( n \) that satisfies the equation. We need to solve for \( n \) such that:
  \[
  n + 1000 = 70 \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor
  \]
  For \( n \) to be a positive integer, \( \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor \) must be less than or equal to 1000. We need to find the largest \( n \) such that \( \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor \leq 1000 \).
  By solving the inequality:
  \[
  70 \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor > 1000 \implies \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor > \frac{1000}{70} \approx 14.2857
  \]
  The largest \( n \) that satisfies this condition is 1000. Therefore, the number of positive integers \( n \) that satisfy the equation is 6.
