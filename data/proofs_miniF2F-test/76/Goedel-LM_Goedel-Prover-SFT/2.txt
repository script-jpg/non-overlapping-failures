  To determine how many positive integers \( n \) satisfy the equation \(\dfrac{n+1000}{70} = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor\), we need to find the number of integers \( n \) for which the equation holds. The equation involves the floor function, which is the greatest integer not exceeding \( x \).
  Given the equation \(\dfrac{n+1000}{70} = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor\), we can rewrite it as:
  \[
  \dfrac{n+1000}{70} = k \quad \text{where} \quad k \in \mathbb{Z}
  \]
  This implies:
  \[
  n + 1000 = 70k
  \]
  Solving for \( n \):
  \[
  n = 70k - 1000
  \]
  We need to find the number of positive integers \( n \) such that \( n \) is a perfect square. Let \( n = a^2 \) where \( a \) is an integer. Substituting \( n = a^2 \) into the equation:
  \[
  a^2 + 1000 = 70k
  \]
  Solving for \( k \):
  \[
  k = \frac{a^2 + 1000}{70}
  \]
  For \( k \) to be an integer, \( a^2 + 1000 \) must be divisible by 70. We need to find the number of perfect squares \( a^2 \) such that \( a^2 + 1000 \) is divisible by 70.
  By testing values, we find that \( a \) can be any integer from 1 to 20 (since \( 20^2 = 400 \) and \( 21^2 = 441 \), which is greater than 1000). For each \( a \), \( a^2 + 1000 \) will be divisible by 70 if \( a^2 \) is a multiple of 70.
  Testing values:
  - \( a = 1 \): \( 1^2 + 1000 = 1001 \) (not divisible by 70)
  - \( a = 2 \): \( 2^2 + 1000 = 1004 \) (not divisible by 70)
  - \( a = 3 \): \( 3^2 + 1000 = 1009 \) (not divisible by 70)
  - \( a = 4 \): \( 4^2 + 1000 = 1016 \) (divisible by 70)
  - \( a = 5 \): \( 5^2 + 1000 = 1025 \) (divisible by 70)
  - \( a = 6 \): \( 6^2 + 1000 = 1036 \) (divisible by 70)
  - \( a = 7 \): \( 7^2 + 1000 = 1049 \) (divisible by 70)
  - \( a = 8 \): \( 8^2 + 1000 = 1056 \) (divisible by 70)
  - \( a = 9 \): \( 9^2 + 1000 = 1065 \) (divisible by 70)
  - \( a = 10 \): \( 10^2 + 1000 = 1070 \) (divisible by 70)
  - \( a = 11 \): \( 11^2 + 1000 = 1081 \) (divisible by 70)
  - \( a = 12 \): \( 12^2 + 1000 = 1092 \) (divisible by 70)
  - \( a = 13 \): \( 13^2 + 1000 = 1105 \) (divisible by 70)
  - \( a = 14 \): \( 14^2 + 1000 = 1120 \) (divisible by 70)
  - \( a = 15 \): \( 15^2 + 1000 = 1145 \) (divisible by 70)
  - \( a = 16 \): \( 16^2 + 1000 = 1180 \) (divisible by 70)
  - \( a = 17 \): \( 17^2 + 1000 = 1217 \) (divisible by 70)
  - \( a = 18 \): \( 18^2 + 1000 = 1256 \) (divisible by 70)
  - \( a = 19 \): \( 19^2 + 1000 = 1297 \) (divisible by 70)
  - \( a = 20 \): \( 20^2 + 1000 = 1364 \) (divisible by 70)
  Thus, the values of \( a \) that satisfy the condition are \( a = 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 \). There are 6 such values.
  Therefore, the number of positive integers \( n \) that satisfy the given equation is 6.
