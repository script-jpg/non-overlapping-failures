  To determine the number of positive integers \( n \) that satisfy the equation \(\dfrac{n+1000}{70} = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor\), we need to find the values of \( n \) for which the equation holds true. This involves setting up the equation, solving for \( n \), and verifying that the solutions are consistent with the given conditions.
