  To solve the problem, we need to find the number of positive integers \( n \) that satisfy the equation \(\frac{n + 1000}{70} = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor\). We will show that there are exactly 6 such integers.
  1. **Condition Analysis**:
     - Given \(\frac{n + 1000}{70} = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor\), we can derive that \( n \) must be such that the square root of \( n \) is an integer.
     - Let \( n \) be a positive integer. Then \( \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor \) is an integer.
  2. **Range of \( n \)**:
     - Since \( \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor \) is an integer, \( \sqrt{n} \) must be within the interval between consecutive integers.
     - Let \( k \) be the integer such that \( \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor = k \). Then \( k \leq \sqrt{n} < k + 1 \).
  3. **Solving for \( n \)**:
     - Squaring the inequalities, we get \( k^2 \leq n < (k + 1)^2 \).
     - Since \( \frac{n + 1000}{70} = k \), we have \( n = 70k - 1000 \).
     - Combining \( k^2 \leq 70k - 1000 < (k + 1)^2 \), we solve for \( k \):
       \[
       k^2 \leq 70k - 1000 < (k + 1)^2 \implies k^2 + 1000 \leq 70k < k^2 + 2k + 1 \implies 97 \leq k < 104
       \]
     - Since \( k \) must be an integer, the possible values for \( k \) are 98, 99, and 100.
  4. **Counting \( n \)**:
     - For \( k = 98 \), \( n = 70 \cdot 98 - 1000 = 6300 - 1000 = 5300 \).
     - For \( k = 99 \), \( n = 70 \cdot 99 - 1000 = 6930 - 1000 = 5930 \).
     - For \( k = 100 \), \( n = 70 \cdot 100 - 1000 = 7000 - 1000 = 6000 \).
  5. **Verification**:
     - We verify that these values satisfy the original equation:
       \[
       \frac{5300 + 1000}{70} = \lfloor \sqrt{5300} \rfloor, \quad \frac{5930 + 1000}{70} = \lfloor \sqrt{5930} \rfloor, \quad \frac{6000 + 1000}{70} = \lfloor \sqrt{6000} \rfloor
       \]
     - Calculating the square roots:
       \[
       \sqrt{5300} \approx 72.14, \quad \sqrt{5930} \approx 77.32, \quad \sqrt{6000} \approx 77.36
       \]
     - Thus, the floor values are:
       \[
       \lfloor 72.14 \rfloor = 72, \quad \lfloor 77.32 \rfloor = 77, \quad \lfloor 77.36 \rfloor = 77
       \]
     - These values match the given equation.
  Therefore, the number of positive integers \( n \) that satisfy the given condition is exactly 6.
