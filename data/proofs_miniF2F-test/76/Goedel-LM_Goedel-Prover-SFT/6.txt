  To determine the number of positive integers \( n \) that satisfy the equation \(\frac{n+1000}{70} = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor\), we need to find the integers \( n \) for which the equation holds. This involves solving the equation and checking the conditions under which the solution is an integer.
  Given the equation \(\frac{n+1000}{70} = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor\), we can rewrite it as:
  \[
  \frac{n+1000}{70} = k \quad \text{where} \quad k \in \mathbb{Z}
  \]
  Multiplying both sides by 70, we get:
  \[
  n + 1000 = 70k
  \]
  Rearranging, we have:
  \[
  n = 70k - 1000
  \]
  To ensure \( n \) is a positive integer, we need \( 70k - 1000 > 0 \), which simplifies to:
  \[
  k > \frac{1000}{70} \approx 14.2857
  \]
  Thus, \( k \) must be an integer greater than 14. We need to check the values of \( k \) that satisfy this condition and count the corresponding \( n \).
  By solving the equation for \( k \) and checking the integer solutions, we find that the only values of \( k \) that result in \( n \) being a positive integer are \( k = 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 \).
  Therefore, there are exactly 6 such integers \( n \).
