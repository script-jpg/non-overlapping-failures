  To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers \( n \) that satisfy the equation \(\frac{n+1000}{70} = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor\). We will show that there are exactly 6 such integers.
  1. **Identify the condition**: For \( n \) to be in the set \( S \), it must satisfy \( 0 < n \) and \(\frac{n+1000}{70} = \lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor\).
  2. **Range of \( n \)**: We will check the values of \( n \) from 1 to 100 to see if they satisfy the given condition.
  3. **Simplify the equation**: For each \( n \), we will compute \(\frac{n+1000}{70}\) and check if it equals \(\lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor\).
  4. **Verification**: We will verify that the only values of \( n \) that satisfy the condition are the integers from 1 to 100 that are perfect squares.
  5. **Count the solutions**: After verifying, we will count the number of such \( n \) and find that there are exactly 6.
