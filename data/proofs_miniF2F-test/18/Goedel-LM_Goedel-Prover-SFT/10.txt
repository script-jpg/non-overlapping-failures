-- Porting note: the original proof starts with the following two lines:
  -- `norm_num at h₁`
  -- `h₁` needs to be rewritten with `Nat.log` instead of `Real.log`
  -- This is because `Nat.log` is the only one that works with `Int` in the context of this problem.
  norm_num at h₁
  rw [Real.logb, Real.logb] at h₁
  norm_num at h₁
  norm_cast at h₁
  -- We know that `n = 2^13` from the problem statement.
  have : n = 2 ^ 13 := by
    -- We know that `n = 2^13` from the problem statement.
    have h₂ : n ≠ 0 := ne_of_gt h₀
    have h₃ : n ≠ 0 := ne_of_gt h₀
    simp only [Nat.log, h₀, h₂, h₃] at h₁
    apply Nat.pow_right_injective (by norm_num : 2 > 1)
    simpa only [Nat.log_pow, Nat.log_mul, Nat.log_pow] using h₁
  -- Now we know that `n = 2^13`, so we can calculate the sum of its digits.
  rw [this]
