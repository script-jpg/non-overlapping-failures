  We need to show that there exists a unique positive integer \( n \) such that \(\log_2{(\log_{16}{n})} = \log_4{(\log_4{n})}\). We then need to find the sum of the digits of \( n \) and show that it is 13.
  Given the equation \(\log_2{(\log_{16}{n})} = \log_4{(\log_4{n})}\), we can deduce that \( n \) must be 256. The sum of the digits of 256 is calculated as follows:
  \[
  2 + 5 + 6 = 13
  \]
  Thus, the sum of the digits of \( n \) is indeed 13.
