  We need to show that there is a unique positive integer \( n \) such that \( \log_2{(\log_{16}{n})} = \log_4{(\log_4{n})} \) and that the sum of the digits of \( n \) is 13. We will use the given conditions and properties of logarithms to derive the result.
  1. **Simplify the given logarithmic equation**:
     \[
     \log_2{(\log_{16}{n})} = \log_4{(\log_4{n})}
     \]
     Using the change of base formula for logarithms, we can rewrite this equation as:
     \[
     \frac{\log{(\log_{16}{n})}{\log{2}}} = \frac{\log{(\log_4{n})}{\log{4}}}
     \]
     Simplifying further, we get:
     \[
     \log_{16}{n} = \log_{4}{n}
     \]
     This implies:
     \[
     16^k = 4^l
     \]
     Since \( 16 = 4^2 \), we can write:
     \[
     (4^2)^k = 4^l \implies 4^{2k} = 4^l \implies 2k = l
     \]
  2. **Express \( n \) in terms of \( k \) and \( l \)**:
     \[
     n = 4^l = 16^{k}
     \]
     Given \( 16 = 4^2 \), we have:
     \[
     n = (4^2)^k = 4^{2k}
     \]
  3. **Sum of digits of \( n \)**:
     Since \( n = 4^{2k} \), the sum of the digits of \( n \) is:
     \[
     \sum_{d \in \text{digits of } n} d = \sum_{d \in \text{digits of } 4^{2k}} d
     \]
     The digits of \( 4^{2k} \) will be a sequence of 2k digits of 4. Therefore, the sum of the digits is:
     \[
     \sum_{d \in \text{digits of } 4^{2k}} d = 2k \times 4 = 8k
     \]
  4. **Given the sum of digits is 13**:
     \[
     8k = 13
     \]
     Solving for \( k \):
     \[
     k = \frac{13}{8} = 1.625
     \]
     Since \( k \) must be an integer, we need to re-evaluate our steps. Instead, we should directly use the given condition that the sum of the digits is 13.
