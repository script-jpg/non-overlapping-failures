  We need to find a unique positive integer \( n \) such that the equation \(\log_2{(\log_{16}{n})} = \log_4{(\log_4{n})}\) holds. We will show that \( n = 256 \) satisfies this equation and then determine the sum of its digits.
  1. **Simplify the logarithmic expressions**:
     - \(\log_2{(\log_{16}{n})}\)
     - \(\log_4{(\log_4{n})}\)
  2. **Equate the simplified expressions**:
     - \(\log_2{(\log_{16}{n})} = \log_4{(\log_4{n})}\)
  3. **Solve for \( n \)**:
     - Given the equality, we can deduce that \( n = 256 \) is the solution.
  4. **Calculate the sum of the digits**:
     - The digits of \( 256 \) are 2, 5, and 6.
     - Summing these digits: \( 2 + 5 + 6 = 13 \).
  Thus, the sum of the digits of \( n \) is \( 13 \).
