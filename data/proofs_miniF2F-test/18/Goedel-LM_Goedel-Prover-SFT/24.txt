  To solve the problem, we need to find a unique positive integer \( n \) such that:
  \[
  \log_2{(\log_{16}{n})} = \log_4{(\log_4{n})}
  \]
  We will use properties of logarithms to simplify and solve for \( n \).
  1. Start by expressing the given equation in terms of logarithms.
  2. Use the properties of logarithms to simplify the equation.
  3. Solve for \( n \) and verify the sum of its digits.
