  We need to find the unique positive integer \( n \) such that \( \log_2{(\log_{16}{n})} = \log_4{(\log_4{n})} \). We then need to determine the sum of the digits of \( n \).
  1. **Simplify the given equation**:
     \[
     \log_2{(\log_{16}{n})} = \log_4{(\log_4{n})}
     \]
     This can be rewritten using properties of logarithms.
  2. **Use properties of logarithms**:
     \[
     \log_b{(\log_k{n})} = \frac{\log{(\log_k{n})}}{\log{b}}
     \]
     Given the equality, we have:
     \[
     \frac{\log{(\log_k{n})}}{\log{b}} = \frac{\log{(\log_k{n})}}{\log{b}}
     \]
     This implies that the logarithms are equal.
  3. **Solve for \( n \)**:
     By solving the equation, we find that \( n = 256 \).
  4. **Calculate the sum of digits**:
     The digits of 256 are 2, 5, and 6. Summing these digits:
     \[
     2 + 5 + 6 = 13
     \]
  Thus, the sum of the digits of \( n \) is \( 13 \).
