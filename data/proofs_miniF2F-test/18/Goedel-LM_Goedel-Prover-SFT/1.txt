  We need to show that there exists a unique positive integer \( n \) such that \(\log_2{(\log_{16}{n})} = \log_4{(\log_4{n})}\), and the sum of the digits of \( n \) is 13. We will use the given conditions to derive the required result.
  1. **Given Condition**: \(\log_2{(\log_{16}{n})} = \log_4{(\log_4{n})}\)
  2. **Objective**: Find \( n \) such that the sum of its digits is 13.
  3. **Mathematical Analysis**:
     - We start by simplifying the given logarithmic equation using properties of logarithms.
     - We then solve for \( n \) by considering the constraints and the sum of its digits.
