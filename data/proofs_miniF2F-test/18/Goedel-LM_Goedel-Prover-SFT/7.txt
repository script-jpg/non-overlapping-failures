  Given the equation \(\log_2{(\log_{16}{n})} = \log_4{(\log_4{n})}\), we need to find the unique positive integer \(n\) that satisfies this equation. We then need to determine the sum of the digits of \(n\) and verify that it equals 13.
  1. Start by simplifying the given equation using properties of logarithms.
  2. Use the fact that \(\log_{16}{n}\) and \(\log_4{n}\) can be expressed in terms of base 10 logarithms.
  3. Equate the expressions and solve for \(n\).
  4. Verify that the sum of the digits of \(n\) is 13.
