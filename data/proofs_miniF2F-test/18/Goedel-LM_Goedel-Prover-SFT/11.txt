  To solve the given equation \(\log_2{(\log_{16}{n})} = \log_4{(\log_4{n})}\), we need to find a positive integer \(n\) that satisfies this equation. The goal is to determine the sum of the digits of \(n\).
  1. **Simplify the logarithmic expressions**:
     - \(\log_2{(\log_{16}{n})}\) can be rewritten using the change of base formula.
     - \(\log_4{(\log_4{n})}\) can be rewritten similarly.
  2. **Equate the simplified expressions**:
     - The simplified forms of both logarithmic expressions should be equal.
  3. **Solve for \(n\)**:
     - By solving the equation, we find that \(n\) must be a specific integer.
  4. **Calculate the sum of the digits**:
     - The sum of the digits of \(n\) is calculated to be 13.
