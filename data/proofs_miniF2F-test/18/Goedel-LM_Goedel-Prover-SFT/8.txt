  We need to show that there is a unique positive integer \( n \) such that \( \log_2{(\log_{16}{n})} = \log_4{(\log_4{n})} \). We are also given that the sum of the digits of \( n \) is 13.
  To prove this, we start by analyzing the given logarithmic equations. We know that:
  \[ \log_2{(\log_{16}{n})} = \log_4{(\log_4{n})} \]
  This implies that the logarithm of the logarithm of \( n \) to the base 2 is equal to the logarithm of the logarithm of \( n \) to the base 4.
  Given the constraints, we can use the properties of logarithms to simplify the expressions. Specifically, we use the change of base formula for logarithms:
  \[ \log_b{(a)} = \frac{\log_k{(a)}}{\log_k{(b)}} \]
  Given the equality:
  \[ \log_2{(\log_{16}{n})} = \log_4{(\log_4{n})} \]
  We can rewrite this as:
  \[ \frac{\log_k{(\log_{16}{n})}}{\log_k{(2)} = \frac{\log_k{(\log_4{n})}}{\log_k{(4)} \]
  Since \( \log_k{(4)} = 2 \log_k{(2)} \), we have:
  \[ \frac{\log_k{(\log_{16}{n})}}{\log_k{(2)} = \frac{\log_k{(\log_4{n})}}{2 \log_k{(2)} \]
  This simplifies to:
  \[ \log_k{(\log_{16}{n})} = \frac{\log_k{(\log_4{n})}}{2} \]
  Given that \( \log_k{(\log_4{n})} \) is a constant, we can solve for \( k \) and find that \( k = 10 \).
  Thus, the sum of the digits of \( n \) is:
  \[ 1 + 3 + 2 + 4 = 10 \]
  However, this does not match the given sum of 13. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate our assumptions or calculations.
