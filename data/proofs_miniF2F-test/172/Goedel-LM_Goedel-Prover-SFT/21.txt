  Given that Jasmine drank 1.5 pints of water on the first 3 miles of her hike, we need to determine how many pints of water she would drink in the next 10 miles if she continued at this rate. We start by setting up the proportion based on the given information:
  \[
  \frac{3}{2} = \frac{x}{10}
  \]
  where \( x \) represents the number of pints of water Jasmine would drink in the next 10 miles. To solve for \( x \), we cross-multiply and simplify:
  \[
  3 \cdot 10 = 2 \cdot x \implies 30 = 2x \implies x = \frac{30}{2} = 15
  \]
  Thus, Jasmine would drink 15 pints of water in the next 10 miles.
