  Given that Jasmine drank 1.5 pints of water on the first 3 miles of her hike, we need to determine how many pints of water she would drink in the next 10 miles if she continued at the same rate. We are given the equation \( \frac{3}{2} \div 3 = \frac{x}{10} \). To solve for \( x \), we first simplify the left-hand side of the equation to \( \frac{1}{2} \). This gives us the equation \( \frac{1}{2} = \frac{x}{10} \). Solving for \( x \) by multiplying both sides by 10, we find \( x = 5 \).

  -- Simplify the left-hand side of the equation to 1/2
  have h₁ : (3 / 2) / 3 = 1 / 2 := by norm_num
  -- Substitute the simplified value back into the original equation
  rw [h₁] at h₀
  -- Solve for x by multiplying both sides by 10
