  To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given equation \( \frac{3}{2} \div 3 = \frac{x}{10} \). This equation involves the division of fractions and a relationship between the variables. We need to find the value of \( x \).
  1. Simplify the left-hand side of the equation:
     \[
     \frac{3}{2} \div 3 = \frac{3}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{3 \times 1}{2 \times 3} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
     \]
  2. Equate the simplified left-hand side to the right-hand side:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} = \frac{x}{10}
     \]
  3. Solve for \( x \) by cross-multiplying:
     \[
     10 \times \frac{1}{2} = 10 \times \frac{x}{10}
     \]
     \[
     5 = x
     \]
  Thus, the value of \( x \) is \( 5 \).
