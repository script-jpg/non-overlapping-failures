  Given that Jasmine drank 1.5 pints of water on the first 3 miles of her hike, we need to determine how many pints of water she would drink in the next 10 miles if she continued at this rate. We start by setting up the proportion:
  \[
  \frac{3}{2} \div 3 = \frac{x}{10}
  \]
  Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:
  \[
  \frac{3}{2} \div 3 = \frac{3}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
  \]
  Thus, the equation becomes:
  \[
  \frac{1}{2} = \frac{x}{10}
  \]
  To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by 10:
  \[
  10 \times \frac{1}{2} = x
  \]
  This simplifies to:
  \[
  5 = x
  \]
  Therefore, Jasmine would drink 5 pints of water in the next 10 miles.

  -- Simplify the given proportion to solve for x
  have h₁ : 3 / 2 / 3 = x / 10 := h₀
  -- Simplify the left-hand side of the proportion
  norm_num at h₁
  -- Solve for x by multiplying both sides by 10
