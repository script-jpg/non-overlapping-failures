  Given that Jasmine drank 1.5 pints of water on the first 3 miles of her hike, and she continued at this rate for the next 10 miles, we need to determine how many pints of water she would drink in the next 10 miles. We are given the equation \( \frac{3}{2} \div 3 = \frac{x}{10} \) to find \( x \).
  First, simplify the left-hand side of the equation:
  \[ \frac{3}{2} \div 3 = \frac{3}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]
  Thus, the equation becomes:
  \[ \frac{1}{2} = \frac{x}{10} \]
  Next, solve for \( x \) by cross-multiplying:
  \[ 10 \times \frac{1}{2} = x \]
  \[ 5 = x \]
  Therefore, Jasmine would drink 5 pints of water in the next 10 miles.
