  Given that Jasmine drank 1.5 pints of water on the first 3 miles of her hike, we need to determine how many pints of water she would drink in the next 10 miles if she continued at this rate. We are given the equation \( \frac{3}{2} \div 3 = \frac{x}{10} \). To solve for \( x \), we first simplify the left-hand side of the equation to \( \frac{1}{2} \). This gives us the equation \( \frac{1}{2} = \frac{x}{10} \). By cross-multiplying, we obtain \( 10 = 2x \). Dividing both sides by 2, we find \( x = 5 \).
