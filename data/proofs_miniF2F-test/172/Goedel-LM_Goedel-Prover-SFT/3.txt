  Given that Jasmine drank 1.5 pints of water on the first 3 miles of her hike, we need to determine how many pints of water she would drink in the next 10 miles if she continued at this rate. We start by setting up the proportion:
  \[
  \frac{3}{2} \div 3 = \frac{x}{10}
  \]
  Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:
  \[
  \frac{3}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{2}
  \]
  Thus, the equation becomes:
  \[
  \frac{1}{2} = \frac{x}{10}
  \]
  To solve for \( x \), we cross-multiply:
  \[
  10 \times \frac{1}{2} = x
  \]
  This simplifies to:
  \[
  x = 5
  \]
