  Given that Jasmine drank 1.5 pints of water on the first 3 miles of her hike, we need to determine how many pints she would drink in the next 10 miles if she continued at this rate. We are given the equation \( \frac{3}{2} \div 3 = \frac{x}{10} \). To solve for \( x \), we first simplify the left-hand side of the equation by dividing by 3, which results in \( \frac{1}{2} \). Thus, the equation becomes \( \frac{1}{2} = \frac{x}{10} \). To isolate \( x \), we multiply both sides by 10, resulting in \( x = 5 \).
