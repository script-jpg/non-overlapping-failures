  Given that Jasmine drank 1.5 pints of water on the first 3 miles of her hike, we can determine the rate of water consumption. We know that the rate of water consumption is \( \frac{3}{2} \) pints per mile. To find out how many pints of water she would drink in the next 10 miles, we use the rate to calculate the total water consumption for 10 miles. The calculation is as follows:
  \[
  \text{Total water consumption} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Distance} = \frac{3}{2} \times 10 = 15 \text{ pints}
  \]
  However, we are given a different condition that simplifies this calculation. We are given the equation \( \frac{3}{2} / 3 = \frac{x}{10} \). This implies that the rate of water consumption is \( \frac{3}{2} / 3 = \frac{x}{10} \). Solving for \( x \) in this equation:
  \[
  \frac{3}{2} / 3 = \frac{x}{10} \implies \frac{3}{2} \times \frac{10}{3} = x \implies x = 5
  \]
  Thus, the number of pints of water Jasmine would drink in the next 10 miles is 5.
