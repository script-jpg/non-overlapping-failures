The problem is a simple rate problem. We're given that Jasmine drank 1.5 pints of water over 3 miles, and we need to find out how much water she would drink over 10 miles if she continues at the same rate.

First, let's set up the problem. We need to find the value of $x$ where $x$ pints of water correspond to 10 miles, given that 1.5 pints correspond to 3 miles.

The rate of water consumption is $\frac{1.5 \text{ pints}}{3 \text{ miles}}$. To find the consumption over 10 miles, we multiply the rate by 10 miles:
$\frac{1.5 \text{ pints}}{3 \text{ miles}} \times 10 \text{ miles} = \frac{1.5}{3} \times 10 \text{ pints} = \frac{1.5 \times 10}{3} \text{ pints} = \frac{15}{3} \text{ pints} = 5 \text{ pints}$

In Lean, we start by importing the necessary libraries:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

Now we'll define the theorem statement. We need to prove that if $x$ satisfies $\frac{3}{2}/3 = x/10$, then $x = 5$:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_440 (x : ℝ) (h₀ : 3 / 2 / 3 = x / 10) : x = 5 := by
```

Now we need to solve for $x$. The equation $\frac{3}{2}/3 = x/10$ simplifies to $\frac{1}{2} = \frac{x}{10}$, which means $x = 5$.

Let's solve it step by step:

1. $\frac{3}{2}/3 = \frac{3}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{2}$
2. So $\frac{1}{2} = \frac{x}{10}$
3. Multiplying both sides by 10: $x = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5$

In Lean, we can directly solve this equation using Lean's automation:

```tactics
field_simp at h₀
linarith
```

The `field_simp` tactic simplifies expressions involving field operations, while `linarith` solves linear arithmetic problems. Together, they can handle this simple algebraic manipulation and verify that $x = 5$ is the unique solution to the equation $\frac{3}{2}/3 = \frac{x}{10}$.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{5}$.
