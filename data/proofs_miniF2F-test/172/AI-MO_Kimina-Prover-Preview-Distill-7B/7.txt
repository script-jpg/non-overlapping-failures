The theorem states that if 3/2 divided by 3 equals x divided by 10, then x equals 5. This is a proportion problem where we're finding the value of x that maintains the same rate of water consumption per mile.

First, let's understand the problem: 
- 1.5 pints of water for 3 miles 
- How much for 10 miles?

This is a rate problem where the rate is 1.5 pints / 3 miles = x pints / 10 miles

Let's solve this algebraically:
1.5/3 = x/10 
1.5 * 10 = 3 * x 
15 = 3x 
x = 5

Now, let's complete the Lean proof:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

We start by importing the necessary libraries and opening namespaces for the mathematical operations we'll need.

Now, let's define the theorem:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_440 (x : ℝ) (h₀ : 3 / 2 / 3 = x / 10) : x = 5 := by
```

The theorem states that if 3/2 divided by 3 equals x divided by 10, then x equals 5. This is precisely our rate problem: 1.5 pints / 3 miles = x pints / 10 miles

Now, let's solve the equation:

3/2 divided by 3 is the same as 3/2 * 1/3 = 1/2
So we have 1/2 = x/10
Multiplying both sides by 10: 5 = x

In Lean, we'll use the `field_simp` tactic to handle the fractions, then `linarith` to solve the linear arithmetic goal:

```tactics
field_simp at h₀
linarith
```

The `field_simp` tactic simplifies expressions involving field operations, handling the division correctly by transforming 3/2/3 into 1/2. Then `linarith` solves the resulting equation 1/2 = x/10 by multiplying both sides by 10 to get x = 5.

So we've proven that x = 5, meaning Jasmine would drink 5 pints of water in the next 10 miles if she continues at the same rate.
