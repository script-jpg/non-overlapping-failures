Let me analyze the problem and formalize it in Lean 4.

The problem states that Jasmine drank 1.5 pints of water over 3 miles, and we need to find how much water she would drink over the next 10 miles if she continues at the same rate.

First, I'll import the necessary libraries:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop
```

I need to set an option to ensure Lean has enough resources to solve the problem:

```tactics
set_option maxHeartbeats 0
```

Now, let's define the theorem statement. We need to relate the rate of water consumption to the distance:

```tactics

```

The theorem states that if 3 miles consumes 1.5 pints (which is represented as 3/2 pints), then 10 miles would consume x pints, and we want to prove x = 5:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_440 (x : ℝ) (h₀ : 3 / 2 / 3 = x / 10) : x = 5 := by
```

The key insight is that the rate of water consumption is constant. This means that the ratio of water to miles is the same in both scenarios. Mathematically, we have:

3 miles : 1.5 pints = 10 miles : x pints

Which translates to the equation:

3/1.5 = 10/x

Or equivalently:

3/2/3 = x/10

This is precisely what our hypothesis `h₀` states.

Now, let's solve for x. From the equation 3/2/3 = x/10, we can simplify:

3/2/3 = 1/2

So we have 1/2 = x/10

Multiplying both sides by 10: x = 10/2 = 5

In Lean, we can use `field_simp` to handle the fractions and `linarith` to solve the linear equation:

```tactics
field_simp at h₀
linarith
```

The `field_simp` tactic simplifies expressions involving field operations, handling the division properly. The `linarith` tactic then solves the resulting linear arithmetic goal, proving that x = 5.

So our complete proof demonstrates that if Jasmine continues to drink water at the same rate for another 10 miles, she will consume 5 pints of water.
