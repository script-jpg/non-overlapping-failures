In this solution, we first interpret the problem: Jasmine drank 1.5 pints over 3 miles, and we need to find how much she would drink over 10 miles if she continues at this rate.

We set up the proportion: \(\frac{1.5 \text{ pints}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{x \text{ pints}}{10 \text{ miles}}\)

This is represented in Lean as `h₀ : 3 / 2 / 3 = x / 10`, where \(3/2\) represents 1.5.

To solve the equation \(\frac{3}{2} / 3 = x / 10\), we first simplify the left side:
\(\frac{3}{2} / 3 = \frac{3}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{2}\)

So we have \(\frac{1}{2} = \frac{x}{10}\)

Multiplying both sides by 10 gives \(x = 5\)

In Lean, we use `field_simp` to handle the fractions and `linarith` to solve the resulting linear arithmetic goal:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

First, we import the necessary libraries and set up the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_440 (x : ℝ) (h₀ : 3 / 2 / 3 = x / 10) : x = 5 := by
```

Now we have the equation \(\frac{3}{2} / 3 = \frac{x}{10}\). Let's solve it:

The left side simplifies as follows:
\(\frac{3}{2} / 3 = \frac{3}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{2}\)

So we have \(\frac{1}{2} = \frac{x}{10}\)

Multiplying both sides by 10, we get:
\(x = 10 \times \frac{1}{2} = 5\)

In Lean, we can solve this directly using `field_simp` and `linarith`:

```tactics
field_simp at h₀
linarith
```

The `field_simp` tactic simplifies expressions involving field operations, and `linarith` solves linear arithmetic goals. Together, they handle the algebraic manipulations we did by hand: simplifying the left side of the equation and solving for \(x\).

Therefore, the answer is 5 pints.
