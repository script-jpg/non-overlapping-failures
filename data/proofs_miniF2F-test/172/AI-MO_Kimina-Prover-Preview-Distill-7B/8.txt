-- Multiply both sides by 10 and simplify the left side to get the answer.

This problem involves a rate proportion. We know that Jasmine drank 1.5 pints of water over 3 miles, which means her rate is 1.5 pints per 3 miles. We want to find out how much water she would drink over 10 miles at this same rate.

First, let's think about how to set up the proportion. We have:
- 1.5 pints : 3 miles = x pints : 10 miles

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:
1.5 pints * 10 miles = 3 miles * x pints

This simplifies to:
15 pints-miles = 3x pints-miles

Dividing both sides by 3 gives:
5 pints = x

So, we expect the answer to be 5 pints.

Now let's analyze the Lean proof:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

We're importing the necessary libraries and setting up our environment. The `maxHeartbeats 0` option means Lean will work as long as needed to solve the problem, without timing out.

Now, let's look at the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_440 (x : ℝ) (h₀ : 3 / 2 / 3 = x / 10) : x = 5 := by
```

The theorem states that if x is the amount of water (in pints) Jasmine drinks in 10 miles, and if she continues at the same rate as the first 3 miles, then x = 5. The hypothesis `h₀` represents our proportion: 3/2/3 = x/10.

Let's break down the proportion. The left side, 3/2/3, represents the rate. It means 3 miles for 2 (1.5) pints. The right side, x/10, represents the unknown amount of water for 10 miles.

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:
3/2/3 * 10 = x

Let's complete the Lean proof:

```tactics
calc
  x = 10 * (3 / 2 / 3) := by field_simp; linarith
  _ = 5 := by ring
```

In the first step, we're isolating x by multiplying both sides of the equation by 10. The `field_simp` tactic handles the rational expressions, and `linarith` solves linear arithmetic problems. This gives us x = 10 * (3/2/3).

In the second step, we're computing the numerical value of x. The `ring` tactic handles arithmetic expressions and confirms that 10 * (3/2/3) = 5.

Therefore, we've proven that x = 5, which means Jasmine would drink 5 pints of water in the next 10 miles if she continues at the same rate.
