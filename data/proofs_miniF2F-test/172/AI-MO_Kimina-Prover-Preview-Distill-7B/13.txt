In this Lean 4 proof, we're given that Jasmine drank 1.5 pints of water over 3 miles, and we need to find how much water she would drink over the next 10 miles if she continues at this rate.

First, let's think about the problem mathematically. The rate of water consumption is 1.5 pints per 3 miles. To find the consumption over 10 miles, we can set up a proportion:

\[
\frac{1.5 \text{ pints}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{x \text{ pints}}{10 \text{ miles}}
\]

Cross-multiplying gives us:

\[
3x = 1.5 \times 10
\]

Simplifying:

\[
3x = 15
\]

Dividing by 3:

\[
x = 5
\]

Now, let's translate this to Lean 4. We start by importing the necessary libraries and setting up the theorem statement:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

Now we'll define the theorem with the given condition and what we want to prove:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_440 (x : ℝ) (h₀ : 3 / 2 / 3 = x / 10) : x = 5 := by
```

We have our theorem statement. The given condition `h₀` represents the proportion. Let's solve the proportion:

From `3 / 2 / 3 = x / 10`, we can rewrite as:
`3/2 / 3 = x / 10`
`3/2 * 1/3 = x / 10`
`1/2 = x / 10`
`10 * 1/2 = x`
`x = 5`

In Lean 4, we can solve this equation directly using algebraic manipulation tactics:

```tactics
field_simp at h₀
linarith
```

The `field_simp` tactic simplifies expressions involving field operations, and `linarith` solves linear arithmetic problems. These tactics are powerful enough to solve our equation directly from the given hypothesis.

So, our complete proof is:

1. We have the equation `3/2/3 = x/10`
2. Simplify the left side: `3/2/3 = (3/2) * (1/3) = 1/2`
3. So `1/2 = x/10`
4. Multiply both sides by 10: `x = 10 * (1/2) = 5`
5. Therefore, `x = 5`

The Lean 4 proof automatically handles these steps with the `field_simp` and `linarith` tactics, proving that `x = 5` as required.
