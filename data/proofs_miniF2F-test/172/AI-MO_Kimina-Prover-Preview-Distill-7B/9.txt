The formal solution is quite concise. It starts by analyzing the problem: Jasmine drank 1.5 pints of water over 3 miles. We need to find how much water she would drink over 10 miles at this constant rate.

First, let's determine the rate at which she drinks water. She drank 1.5 pints for 3 miles, which means her rate is:
\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{1.5 \text{ pints}}{3 \text{ miles}} = 0.5 \text{ pints per mile} \]

Now, if she continues at this rate for 10 miles, the total amount of water she would drink is:
\[ \text{Total water} = 0.5 \text{ pints per mile} \times 10 \text{ miles} = 5 \text{ pints} \]

In the Lean proof, we're given the equation \( \frac{3}{2} / 3 = x / 10 \). Let's solve this equation to find \( x \):

\[ \frac{3}{2} / 3 = x / 10 \]
\[ \frac{3}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} = x / 10 \]
\[ \frac{1}{2} = x / 10 \]
\[ x = 10 \times \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ x = 5 \]

The Lean proof uses `field_simp` to simplify the equation and then `linarith` to solve for \( x \):

```tactics

We've imported the necessary libraries and opened namespaces for working with real numbers, natural numbers, topology, and rational numbers. Now we'll define the theorem:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_440 (x : ℝ) (h₀ : 3 / 2 / 3 = x / 10) : x = 5 := by
  field_simp at h₀
  linarith
```

The proof is complete! The Lean proof confirms that \( x = 5 \), which means Jasmine would drink 5 pints of water in the next 10 miles if she continues at the same rate. This matches our manual calculation.

The key insight in the problem is that the rate of water consumption is constant. By determining the rate from the initial data (1.5 pints for 3 miles), we can apply it to the longer distance (10 miles) to find the total amount of water consumed. The Lean proof formalizes this calculation by solving the equation that represents the proportion between the two situations.
