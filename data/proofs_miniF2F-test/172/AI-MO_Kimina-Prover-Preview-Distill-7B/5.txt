The problem is about determining how many pints of water Jasmine would drink in the next 10 miles if she continues at the same rate. 

First, let's analyze the given information:
- Jasmine drank 1.5 pints of water in the first 3 miles.
- We need to find out how many pints she would drink in the next 10 miles if she continues at this rate.

The rate at which she drinks water is $\frac{1.5 \text{ pints}}{3 \text{ miles}} = 0.5 \text{ pints/mile}$.

To find out how much water she would drink in 10 miles at this rate, we multiply the rate by the distance:
$0.5 \text{ pints/mile} \times 10 \text{ miles} = 5 \text{ pints}$

In Lean, we're given the equation $\frac{3}{2} / 3 = \frac{x}{10}$, where $x$ is the number of pints she would drink in 10 miles. Let's solve this equation step by step:

1. $\frac{3}{2} / 3 = \frac{x}{10}$
2. $\frac{3}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{x}{10}$
3. $\frac{1}{2} = \frac{x}{10}$
4. $10 \times \frac{1}{2} = x$
5. $5 = x$
6. $x = 5$

So we need to prove that $x = 5$ given $\frac{3}{2} / 3 = \frac{x}{10}$.

Let's complete the Lean proof:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

We've imported the necessary libraries and opened namespaces for working with real numbers and arithmetic operations. The `maxHeartbeats 0` option allows Lean to perform as many proof steps as needed, which is useful for arithmetic problems that may require several manipulations.

Now, let's define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_440 (x : ℝ) (h₀ : 3 / 2 / 3 = x / 10) : x = 5 := by
```

We have the theorem statement with a real number $x$ and the hypothesis that $\frac{3}{2} / 3 = \frac{x}{10}$. We need to prove that $x = 5$.

Let's solve the equation algebraically again to verify our approach:
$\frac{3}{2} / 3 = \frac{x}{10}$
$\frac{3}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{x}{10}$
$\frac{1}{2} = \frac{x}{10}$
$10 \times \frac{1}{2} = x$
$x = 5$

In Lean, we can solve this equation directly using Lean's arithmetic capabilities:

```tactics
field_simp at h₀
linarith
```

The `field_simp` tactic simplifies expressions involving field operations, and `linarith` solves linear arithmetic goals. These tactics are powerful enough to solve the equation $\frac{3}{2} / 3 = \frac{x}{10}$ by:
1. Simplifying $\frac{3}{2} / 3$ to $\frac{1}{2}$
2. Setting $\frac{1}{2} = \frac{x}{10}$
3. Solving for $x$ to get $x = 5$
4. Concluding that $x = 5$ satisfies the goal

Therefore, the Lean proof is remarkably concise because the arithmetic is straightforward and Lean's automation can handle it directly. The proof confirms that if Jasmine continues at the same rate of $\frac{1.5 \text{ pints}}{3 \text{ miles}} = 0.5 \text{ pints/mile}$, then in 10 miles she would drink $0.5 \text{ pints/mile} \times 10 \text{ miles} = 5 \text{ pints}$ of water.
</- Jasmine drank 1.5 pints of water on the first 3 miles of her hike. If she continued at this rate, how many pints of water would she drink in the next 10 miles? Show that it is 5.-/
