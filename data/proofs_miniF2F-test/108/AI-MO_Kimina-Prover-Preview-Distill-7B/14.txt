ring
```

The `ring` tactic is powerful enough to automatically expand the left-hand side and simplify it to the right-hand side. It applies the distributive property, combines like terms, and simplifies the expression.

Now, let's think about the mathematical reasoning behind this expansion:

1. Start with the expression $(x+3)(2x-6)$.
2. Apply the distributive property: $(x+3)(2x-6) = x(2x-6) + 3(2x-6)$.
3. Distribute each term: $x(2x-6) = 2x^2 - 6x$ and $3(2x-6) = 6x - 18$.
4. Combine the results: $2x^2 - 6x + 6x - 18$.
5. Combine like terms: $2x^2 - 18$.

The `ring` tactic automates these steps and verifies that the equality holds for all real values of $x$.

Next, let's think about how to prove this equality using Lean 4 with a more detailed proof:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

```

We begin by importing the necessary libraries and setting up the basic structure of our proof. The `maxHeartbeats 0` option allows Lean to run without any limits on the number of steps, which is useful for more complex proofs.

Now, let's define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_432 (x : ℝ) : (x + 3) * (2 * x - 6) = 2 * x ^ 2 - 18 := by
```

We have our theorem statement. Now we need to prove it. In this simple algebraic case, Lean's automation is powerful enough to handle the proof directly:

```tactics
ring
```

The `ring` tactic is perfect for this problem. It automatically:
1. Expands the left-hand side: $(x + 3)(2x - 6) = x \cdot 2x + x \cdot (-6) + 3 \cdot 2x + 3 \cdot (-6)$
2. Simplifies each term: $= 2x^2 - 6x + 6x - 18$
3. Combines like terms: $= 2x^2 - 18$
4. Verifies that this equals the right-hand side

The beauty of the `ring` tactic is that it can solve a wide range of algebraic problems involving polynomials over commutative rings. It handles all the algebraic manipulations that we would do by hand, but in a completely automated way.

So our complete proof is remarkably concise:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat

theorem mathd_algebra_432 (x : ℝ) : (x + 3) * (2 * x - 6) = 2 * x ^ 2 - 18 := by
  ring
```

This proof is complete. It demonstrates that the expression $(x+3)(2x-6)$ simplifies to $2x^2-18$ for all real values of $x$. The Lean proof is elegant in its simplicity, leveraging Lean's powerful automation to handle the algebraic manipulations that would be tedious to write out step by step.
