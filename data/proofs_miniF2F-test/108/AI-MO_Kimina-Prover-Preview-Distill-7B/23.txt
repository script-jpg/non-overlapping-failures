ring

This completes our proof. The `ring` tactic is powerful for solving algebraic goals. It automatically handles the expansion of the product and simplification to show the equality holds.

The key insight in this problem is to apply the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials) to expand $(x+3)(2x-6)$. 

First, distribute $x$ across the terms in the second binomial:
- $x \cdot 2x = 2x^2$
- $x \cdot (-6) = -6x$

Next, distribute $3$ across the terms in the second binomial:
- $3 \cdot 2x = 6x$
- $3 \cdot (-6) = -18$

Combine all these terms: $2x^2 - 6x + 6x - 18$

The $-6x$ and $6x$ terms cancel each other out, leaving us with $2x^2 - 18$.

Therefore, $(x+3)(2x-6) = 2x^2 - 18$.

The Lean 4 proof is remarkably concise because the `ring` tactic is designed to handle exactly these types of algebraic manipulations. It can expand products, collect like terms, and verify that two expressions are equal through algebraic simplification.

In conclusion, we have shown that $(x+3)(2x-6) = 2x^2 - 18$ both through manual expansion and through a formal Lean 4 proof using the `ring` tactic.
