The `ring` tactic is powerful for algebraic manipulations. It automatically expands expressions like $(x+3)(2x-6)$ and simplifies them to $2x^2 - 18$. 

To understand what's happening behind the scenes, let's manually expand the expression:
- First, distribute $x$ across $(2x-6)$: $x \cdot 2x + x \cdot (-6) = 2x^2 - 6x$
- Then distribute $3$ across $(2x-6)$: $3 \cdot 2x + 3 \cdot (-6) = 6x - 18$
- Combine the results: $2x^2 - 6x + 6x - 18 = 2x^2 - 18$

The `ring` tactic handles these algebraic manipulations automatically, making it a perfect choice for proving this equality.

Therefore, the Lean proof is remarkably concise:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

```

These imports give us access to Lean's mathematical libraries and the necessary tools for working with real numbers and algebraic operations.

Now, let's define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_432 (x : ℝ) : (x + 3) * (2 * x - 6) = 2 * x ^ 2 - 18 := by 
  ring
```

The theorem states that for any real number $x$, the expression $(x+3)(2x-6)$ simplifies to $2x^2 - 18$. The proof is simply the `ring` tactic, which performs the algebraic expansion and simplification automatically.

So the complete Lean 4 proof is:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat

theorem mathd_algebra_432 (x : ℝ) : (x + 3) * (2 * x - 6) = 2 * x ^ 2 - 18 := by
  ring
```

This proof is elegant because Lean's `ring` tactic is powerful enough to handle all the algebraic manipulations required to expand the left-hand side and verify that it equals the right-hand side. The tactic applies the distributive property, combines like terms, and simplifies the expression to show that $(x + 3)(2x - 6) = 2x^2 - 18$.
