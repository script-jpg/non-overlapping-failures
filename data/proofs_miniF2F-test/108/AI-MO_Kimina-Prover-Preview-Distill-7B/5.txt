ring

The `ring` tactic is powerful enough to solve this algebraic goal directly. It will expand the left hand side as follows:

1. Apply distributive property: $(x + 3)(2x - 6) = x \cdot 2x + x \cdot (-6) + 3 \cdot 2x + 3 \cdot (-6)$
2. Simplify each term: $= 2x^2 - 6x + 6x - 18$
3. Combine like terms: $= 2x^2 - 18$

The goal is then proven as the expanded form equals $2x^2 - 18$.

The Lean 4 proof is remarkably concise because the `ring` tactic is designed to handle exactly these kinds of algebraic manipulations. It automatically applies all the necessary algebraic rules to prove that the two expressions are equivalent.

Therefore, the complete Lean 4 proof is:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat

theorem mathd_algebra_432 (x : ℝ) : (x + 3) * (2 * x - 6) = 2 * x ^ 2 - 18 := by
  ring
```

This proof is complete and demonstrates how Lean's automation can handle basic algebraic manipulations directly.
