ring
```

So that's it! The `ring` tactic handles all the algebraic manipulation automatically. It expands
$(x+3)(2x-6)$ to $2x^2-6x+6x-18$ and simplifies it to $2x^2-18$.

Now, let me reflect on what we've done. We've successfully proved that $(x+3)(2x-6) = 2x^2-18$ using
the `ring` tactic in Lean 4. This is a straightforward algebraic identity, and Lean's `ring` tactic is powerful
enough to handle it directly. The proof is remarkably concise because Lean can automatically verify simple algebraic
identities like this one.
