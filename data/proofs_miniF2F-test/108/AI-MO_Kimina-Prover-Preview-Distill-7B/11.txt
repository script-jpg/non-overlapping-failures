So the complete proof is:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

```

First, we import the necessary libraries and set up the environment for mathematical reasoning in Lean 4. The `maxHeartbeats 0` setting allows Lean to work with large proofs without running out of resources.

Now, let's define our theorem:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_432 (x : ℝ) : (x + 3) * (2 * x - 6) = 2 * x ^ 2 - 18 := by
```

We have a theorem statement that says for any real number x, (x + 3)(2x - 6) = 2x^2 - 18. The proof of this is a straightforward algebraic expansion.

Let's complete the proof:

```tactics
ring
```

The `ring` tactic is powerful enough to solve this algebraic equality by itself. It will expand the left-hand side:
(x + 3)(2x - 6) = x(2x - 6) + 3(2x - 6)
= 2x^2 - 6x + 6x - 18
= 2x^2 - 18

And it will verify that this is equal to the right-hand side, 2x^2 - 18.

So our complete proof is remarkably simple: we state the theorem and then use the `ring` tactic to automatically verify the algebraic equality. This is a great example of how Lean's automation can handle basic algebraic manipulations that would otherwise require multiple steps of manual calculation.
