In this Lean 4 proof, we need to expand the expression $(x+3)(2x-6)$ and show that it equals $2x^2-18$. The `ring` tactic is powerful for solving algebraic goals involving polynomials. It will expand the left-hand side by distributing the terms:

- First, distribute $x$ over $(2x-6)$: $x \cdot 2x + x \cdot (-6) = 2x^2 - 6x$
- Then, distribute $3$ over $(2x-6)$: $3 \cdot 2x + 3 \cdot (-6) = 6x - 18$
- Combine these results: $2x^2 - 6x + 6x - 18$
- Simplify by combining like terms: $2x^2 - 18$

The tactic `ring` is able to perform all these algebraic manipulations automatically and verify that $(x + 3) * (2 * x - 6) = 2 * x^2 - 18$ is indeed true for all real numbers $x$.

So our complete proof is:

This is a perfect example of how Lean's automation can handle routine algebraic manipulations that would be tedious to prove step-by-step. The `ring` tactic is particularly powerful for goals involving polynomial equalities and inequalities over commutative rings.
