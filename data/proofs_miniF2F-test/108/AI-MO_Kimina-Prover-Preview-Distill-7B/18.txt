The proof is completed by using the `ring` tactic, which is powerful for proving goals involving polynomial equalities. Let's verify the expansion manually:

To expand $(x+3)(2x-6)$, we apply the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials):

1. Multiply the first terms: $x \cdot 2x = 2x^2$
2. Multiply the outer terms: $x \cdot (-6) = -6x$
3. Multiply the inner terms: $3 \cdot 2x = 6x$
4. Multiply the last terms: $3 \cdot (-6) = -18$

Combine all these results: $2x^2 + (-6x) + 6x + (-18)$

Simplify by combining like terms: $2x^2 - 6x + 6x - 18 = 2x^2 - 18$

The middle terms $-6x$ and $6x$ cancel each other out, leaving us with $2x^2 - 18$.

The `ring` tactic in Lean is able to compute this expansion automatically by applying the rules of arithmetic in a commutative ring, which real numbers form. It expands the left-hand side, simplifies it, and checks that it equals the right-hand side.

Therefore, the complete formal proof is:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

We're importing the necessary libraries and opening namespaces for working with real numbers and algebraic operations.

Next, we'll state the theorem:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_432 (x : ℝ) : (x + 3) * (2 * x - 6) = 2 * x ^ 2 - 18 := by
```

We have the goal to prove that $(x + 3) * (2 * x - 6) = 2 * x^2 - 18$ for any real number $x$.

To complete the proof, we'll use the `ring` tactic:

```tactics
ring
```

The `ring` tactic is powerful enough to expand polynomial expressions and verify equalities in commutative rings. It will:

1. Expand $(x + 3) * (2 * x - 6)$ to $x * 2 * x + x * (-6) + 3 * 2 * x + 3 * (-6)$
2. Simplify to $2 * x^2 - 6 * x + 6 * x - 18$
3. Combine like terms to get $2 * x^2 - 18$
4. Verify that this equals the right-hand side

Thus, the complete proof is remarkably concise because Lean's automation can handle these algebraic manipulations directly.
