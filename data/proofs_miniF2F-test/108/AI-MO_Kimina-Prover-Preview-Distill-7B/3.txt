ring

Let me explain what's happening in this proof:

1. We have a theorem statement that claims $(x + 3)(2x - 6) = 2x^2 - 18$ for all real numbers $x$.
2. The proof uses the `ring` tactic, which is a powerful automated reasoning tool in Lean 4 for solving algebraic identities.
3. The `ring` tactic automatically expands the left-hand side: 
   - First, it applies the distributive property: $(x + 3)(2x - 6) = x \cdot 2x + x \cdot (-6) + 3 \cdot 2x + 3 \cdot (-6)$
   - Then it simplifies each term: $= 2x^2 - 6x + 6x - 18$
   - Combining like terms: $= 2x^2 - 18$
4. After the expansion, the tactic verifies that the result equals $2x^2 - 18$, completing the proof.

This is a straightforward algebraic manipulation that would typically be done by hand in a high school algebra class. The Lean proof is remarkably concise because the `ring` tactic is powerful enough to handle all the algebraic steps automatically.

The complete formal proof in Lean 4 is:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

Now we have imported the necessary libraries and opened namespaces for working with real numbers and algebraic operations.

Next, we state the theorem:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_432 (x : ℝ) : (x + 3) * (2 * x - 6) = 2 * x ^ 2 - 18 := by
  ring
```

And that's it! The Lean proof is complete. The `ring` tactic has successfully verified the algebraic identity by:
1. Expanding the left-hand side using distributivity
2. Simplifying the expression
3. Checking that it equals the right-hand side

This demonstrates how Lean can be used to verify basic algebraic facts with minimal human intervention, leveraging automated reasoning to handle the routine algebraic manipulations that would otherwise require multiple steps of manual proof.
