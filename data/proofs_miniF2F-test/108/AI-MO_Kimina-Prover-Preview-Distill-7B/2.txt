ring

```

This theorem will be proven using the ring tactic, which is powerful for solving algebraic goals. The ring tactic will expand the left-hand side $(x+3)(2x-6)$ by distributing the terms:

- First, multiply $x$ by $2x$ to get $2x^2$.
- Then, multiply $x$ by $-6$ to get $-6x$.
- Next, multiply $3$ by $2x$ to get $6x$.
- Finally, multiply $3$ by $-6$ to get $-18$.

So the expanded form is $2x^2 - 6x + 6x - 18$. The $-6x$ and $6x$ terms cancel each other, leaving $2x^2 - 18$, which matches the right-hand side of the equation.

Therefore, we have shown that $(x+3)(2x-6) = 2x^2 - 18$.
