ring
```

The `ring` tactic is powerful for solving algebraic identities. It automatically expands the left-hand side:
- $(x + 3)(2x - 6) = x \cdot 2x + x \cdot (-6) + 3 \cdot 2x + 3 \cdot (-6)$
- $= 2x^2 - 6x + 6x - 18$
- $= 2x^2 - 18$

The intermediate steps show that the $-6x$ and $+6x$ terms cancel each other, and the $3 \cdot (-6) = -18$ term remains. The result is $2x^2 - 18$, which matches the expected answer.

This completes our formal proof of the algebraic identity.
