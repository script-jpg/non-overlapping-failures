This theorem statement declares that for any real number $x$, the expression $(x+3)(2x-6)$ equals $2x^2-18$. The proof is completed using the `ring` tactic, which is powerful for solving algebraic identities. 

Let's expand the expression manually to verify:
$(x+3)(2x-6) = x \cdot 2x + x \cdot (-6) + 3 \cdot 2x + 3 \cdot (-6)$
$= 2x^2 - 6x + 6x - 18$
$= 2x^2 - 18$

The $-6x$ and $6x$ terms cancel each other out, leaving us with $2x^2 - 18$. The `ring` tactic automatically performs these algebraic manipulations and verifies that the equality holds for all real values of $x$.
