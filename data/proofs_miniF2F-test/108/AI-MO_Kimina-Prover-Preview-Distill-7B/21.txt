ring

```

The `ring` tactic is powerful for solving goals involving algebraic manipulations in commutative rings. It automatically handles the expansion of products and simplification of expressions. In this case, it expands $(x+3)(2x-6)$ as follows:

1. Apply the distributive property: $(x+3)(2x-6) = x(2x-6) + 3(2x-6)$
2. Distribute each term: $x(2x-6) = 2x^2 - 6x$ and $3(2x-6) = 6x - 18$
3. Combine: $2x^2 - 6x + 6x - 18 = 2x^2 - 18$
4. The $-6x$ and $6x$ terms cancel out, leaving $2x^2 - 18$

The Lean proof is remarkably concise because the `ring` tactic encapsulates all these algebraic manipulations. It knows the rules of arithmetic in real numbers (which form a commutative ring) and applies them to prove that the equality holds for all real values of $x$.
