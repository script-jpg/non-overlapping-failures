ring
```

The `ring` tactic is powerful for algebraic manipulations. It automatically expands and simplifies the left-hand side:
- $(x + 3)(2x - 6) = x \cdot 2x + x \cdot (-6) + 3 \cdot 2x + 3 \cdot (-6)$
- $= 2x^2 - 6x + 6x - 18$
- $= 2x^2 - 18$

The simplification is correct because:
1. The distributive property expands the product
2. Like terms ($-6x$ and $6x$) cancel out
3. The result is $2x^2 - 18$

The Lean 4 solution is remarkably concise. The `ring` tactic handles all the algebraic manipulation that we would do by hand, proving the equality directly. This demonstrates how Lean's automation can efficiently verify straightforward algebraic identities.
