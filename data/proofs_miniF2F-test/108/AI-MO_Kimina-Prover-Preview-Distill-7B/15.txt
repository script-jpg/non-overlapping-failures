ring_nf

In Lean 4, we can solve this algebra problem by expanding the expression $(x+3)(2x-6)$ and showing that it equals $2x^2-18$. The `ring_nf` tactic is powerful for handling algebraic manipulations in commutative rings. It automatically handles the distributive property, collects like terms, and simplifies the expression. 

Let's walk through the algebraic expansion manually to verify the result:

1. Expand $(x+3)(2x-6)$ using the distributive property:
   - First, multiply $x$ by each term in the second binomial: $x \cdot 2x = 2x^2$ and $x \cdot (-6) = -6x$
   - Then, multiply $3$ by each term in the second binomial: $3 \cdot 2x = 6x$ and $3 \cdot (-6) = -18$

2. Combine all the terms: $2x^2 - 6x + 6x - 18$

3. Notice that $-6x + 6x = 0$, so they cancel out

4. The result is $2x^2 - 18$, which is exactly what we needed to prove.

In Lean 4, the formal proof is remarkably concise because Lean's automation can handle these algebraic manipulations directly. The `ring_nf` tactic normalizes ring expressions, applying all the necessary algebraic rules automatically. This is a great example of how Lean's automation can efficiently solve problems that would require several steps of algebraic manipulation by hand.
