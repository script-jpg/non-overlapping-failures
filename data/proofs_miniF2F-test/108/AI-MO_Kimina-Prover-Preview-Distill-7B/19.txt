This is a straightforward algebraic expansion. To expand the expression $(x+3)(2x-6)$, we apply the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials):

1. Multiply the first terms: $x \cdot 2x = 2x^2$.
2. Multiply the outer terms: $x \cdot (-6) = -6x$.
3. Multiply the inner terms: $3 \cdot 2x = 6x$.
4. Multiply the last terms: $3 \cdot (-6) = -18$.

Next, we combine the results: $2x^2 + (-6x) + 6x + (-18)$. 

Notice that $-6x$ and $6x$ are like terms, so they cancel each other out: $-6x + 6x = 0$.

Thus, we are left with $2x^2 - 18$. 

Therefore, $(x+3)(2x-6) = 2x^2 - 18$.

The Lean proof for this is remarkably concise because the `ring` tactic is powerful enough to handle basic algebraic manipulations like expansion and simplification. It automatically applies the distributive property and combines like terms to prove the equality.
