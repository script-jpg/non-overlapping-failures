ring
```

The proof is remarkably straightforward because Lean has a tactic called `ring` that is specifically designed to solve equations involving polynomial expressions. This tactic is powerful enough to expand the left-hand side expression $(x+3)(2x-6)$ and simplify it to $2x^2-18$ automatically. The `ring` tactic recognizes the algebraic structure of the expressions, applies the distributive property, combines like terms, and verifies that the equality holds for all real values of $x$. This demonstrates Lean's ability to handle basic algebraic manipulations efficiently, which is especially useful for more complex mathematical developments where algebraic simplifications might be involved.
