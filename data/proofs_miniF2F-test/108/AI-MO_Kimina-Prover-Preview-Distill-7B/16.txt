ring
```

The `ring` tactic is powerful enough to solve this algebraic manipulation problem directly. It will expand the left-hand side by applying the distributive property:

$(x + 3)(2x - 6) = x \cdot 2x + x \cdot (-6) + 3 \cdot 2x + 3 \cdot (-6)$

$= 2x^2 - 6x + 6x - 18$

$= 2x^2 - 18$

The intermediate steps of $2x^2 - 6x + 6x - 18$ are shown, but the tactic is able to simplify the expression further by combining like terms ($-6x + 6x = 0$) to produce the final result of $2x^2 - 18$.

Therefore, the formal proof is remarkably concise, as Lean's computational tactics can handle routine algebraic manipulations that would be tedious to prove step by step using more fundamental axioms of real numbers.
