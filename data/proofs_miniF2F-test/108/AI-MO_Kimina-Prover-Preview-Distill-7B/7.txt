This theorem statement declares that for any real number $x$, the expression $(x + 3)(2x - 6)$ equals $2x^2 - 18$. The proof is remarkably concise: it uses the `ring` tactic, which is powerful for solving algebraic identities.

Let's verify this algebraically:
- Expand $(x+3)(2x-6)$ using the distributive property: 
  - First: $x \cdot 2x = 2x^2$
  - Outer: $x \cdot (-6) = -6x$
  - Inner: $3 \cdot 2x = 6x$
  - Last: $3 \cdot (-6) = -18$
- Combine: $2x^2 - 6x + 6x - 18 = 2x^2 - 18$

The $-6x$ and $6x$ terms cancel each other, resulting in $2x^2 - 18$.

The `ring` tactic in Lean is able to automatically prove this equality by recognizing it as an algebraic identity. It applies the distributive law, collects like terms, and simplifies to show the equality holds.

Therefore, the complete formal proof is:

The theorem is now proved. The `ring` tactic effectively performed all the algebraic steps we did manually: it expanded the product, collected like terms, and simplified to show that $(x + 3)(2x - 6) = 2x^2 - 18$ for any real number $x$.
