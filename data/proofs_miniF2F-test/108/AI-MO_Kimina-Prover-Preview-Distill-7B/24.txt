In the proof, we have imported the necessary libraries and opened the Real namespace. We then state the theorem as `(x + 3) * (2 * x - 6) = 2 * x ^ 2 - 18` for any real number x. The proof is straightforward and uses the `ring_nf` tactic, which stands for "ring normal form". This tactic is powerful for algebraic manipulations as it automatically applies the distributive, associative, and commutative properties of a ring to simplify expressions. In this case, it expands the left-hand side as follows:

1. Apply distributive property: $(x+3)(2x-6) = x(2x-6) + 3(2x-6)$
2. Distribute again: $x(2x-6) + 3(2x-6) = 2x^2 - 6x + 6x - 18$
3. Combine like terms: $2x^2 - 6x + 6x - 18 = 2x^2 - 18$

The result is indeed $2x^2 - 18$, which matches the right-hand side of our theorem.

The `ring_nf` tactic handles all these algebraic manipulations automatically, proving the equality is true for all real values of x. This is a great example of how Lean can efficiently verify algebraic identities that would otherwise require several steps of manual calculation.
