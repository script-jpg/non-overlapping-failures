The problem asks us to expand the expression $(x+3)(2x-6)$ and show that it simplifies to $2x^2-18$. This is a classic algebra problem that involves applying the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials) to multiply two binomials.

Let's work through this step by step:

1. **Apply the distributive property**: Multiply each term in the first binomial by each term in the second binomial.
   - First: $x \cdot 2x = 2x^2$
   - Outer: $x \cdot (-6) = -6x$
   - Inner: $3 \cdot 2x = 6x$
   - Last: $3 \cdot (-6) = -18$

2. **Combine like terms**: After multiplying, we have $2x^2 - 6x + 6x - 18$. The $-6x$ and $6x$ terms cancel each other out, leaving us with $2x^2 - 18$.

In Lean, we can use the `ring_nf` tactic, which is designed to simplify expressions involving rings (like real numbers) by applying all the necessary algebraic rules automatically. This tactic will perform the expansion and simplification for us, proving that $(x+3)(2x-6) = 2x^2-18$.

Let's complete the proof:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

```

We start by importing the necessary libraries and setting up the environment. The `maxHeartbeats 0` option allows Lean to work with arbitrarily large proof states, which is useful for more complex algebraic manipulations.

Now, let's define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_432 (x : ℝ) : (x + 3) * (2 * x - 6) = 2 * x ^ 2 - 18 := by
```

We have defined the theorem with a real number parameter `x` and stated that the expression $(x+3)(2x-6)$ equals $2x^2-18$. Now we need to prove this equality.

To complete the proof, we'll use the `ring_nf` tactic, which is powerful for these kinds of algebraic manipulations:

```tactics
ring_nf
```

The `ring_nf` tactic will:
1. Expand $(x+3)(2x-6)$ by multiplying each term
2. Combine like terms
3. Verify that the result equals $2x^2-18$

This tactic works by:
- distributivity: $(x+3)(2x-6) = x(2x-6) + 3(2x-6)$
- distributivity again: $x(2x-6) = 2x^2 - 6x$ and $3(2x-6) = 6x - 18$
- combine results: $2x^2 - 6x + 6x - 18 = 2x^2 - 18$

The beauty of Lean's automation is that it can handle these algebraic manipulations efficiently, saving us from having to write out each step explicitly.

Therefore, we have proven that $(x+3)(2x-6) = 2x^2-18$.
