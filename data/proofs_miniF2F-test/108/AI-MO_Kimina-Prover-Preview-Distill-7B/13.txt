ring_nf
```

The `ring_nf` tactic is powerful for solving algebraic goals. It automatically handles the expansion of polynomial expressions and simplification to show the equality holds.

To manually verify: $(x+3)(2x-6) = x(2x-6) + 3(2x-6) = 2x^2 - 6x + 6x - 18 = 2x^2 - 18$

The tactic `ring_nf` (ring normal form) applies the distributive property and collects like terms to show that $(x + 3) * (2 * x - 6)$ simplifies to $2 * x^2 - 18$.

So our complete proof is:

```tactics

We've imported the necessary libraries and opened namespaces for our work.

Now we'll define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_432 (x : ℝ) : (x + 3) * (2 * x - 6) = 2 * x ^ 2 - 18 := by
  ring_nf
```

The theorem states that for any real number $x$, $(x + 3)(2x - 6) = 2x^2 - 18$. The `ring_nf` tactic proves this by:
1. Expanding $(x + 3)(2x - 6)$ using the distributive property
2. Simplifying to get $2x^2 - 6x + 6x - 18$
3. Collecting like terms to get $2x^2 - 18$
4. Verifying that this equals the right-hand side of our equation

Therefore, we've successfully proven that $(x + 3)(2x - 6) = 2x^2 - 18$ for all real values of $x$.
