The problem asks us to expand the expression $(x+3)(2x-6)$ and show that it equals $2x^2-18$. Let's work through this step by step.

First, I'll think about how to expand $(x+3)(2x-6)$. This is a binomial expansion, where we apply the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials): multiply the first terms, then the outer terms, then the inner terms, then the last terms, and sum the results.

1. Multiply the first terms: $x \cdot 2x = 2x^2$
2. Multiply the outer terms: $x \cdot (-6) = -6x$
3. Multiply the inner terms: $3 \cdot 2x = 6x$
4. Multiply the last terms: $3 \cdot (-6) = -18$

Adding these together: $2x^2 + (-6x) + 6x + (-18) = 2x^2 - 18$

Notice that the $-6x$ and $6x$ terms cancel each other out, which is why the final result is $2x^2-18$ and not something more complicated.

In Lean 4, we'll use the `ring` tactic, which is powerful enough to handle these kinds of algebraic manipulations automatically. The `ring` tactic is designed to prove equalities in commutative rings, which real numbers form a part of. It will expand the left side, collect like terms, and verify that it equals the right side.

Let me write the Lean 4 proof:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

Now I'll state the theorem:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_432 (x : ℝ) : (x + 3) * (2 * x - 6) = 2 * x ^ 2 - 18 := by
```

With the theorem statement defined, I'll complete the proof:

```tactics
ring
```

The `ring` tactic is sufficient here because it can automatically expand the product on the left side and simplify it to the expression on the right side. It handles all the algebraic manipulations we did manually above: distributing the terms, collecting like terms, and verifying the equality.

This proof is elegant in its simplicity. The `ring` tactic encapsulates the algebraic reasoning we would otherwise need to write out explicitly, handling all the steps of the expansion and simplification for us.
