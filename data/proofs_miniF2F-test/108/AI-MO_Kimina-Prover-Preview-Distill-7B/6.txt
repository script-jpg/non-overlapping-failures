This theorem can be proved directly using the `ring` tactic, which is powerful enough to expand algebraic expressions and prove equalities in commutative rings. The tactic would expand $(x+3)(2x-6)$ as follows:

1. Apply distributive property: $(x+3)(2x-6) = x(2x-6) + 3(2x-6)$
2. Distribute again: $x(2x-6) + 3(2x-6) = 2x^2 - 6x + 6x - 18$
3. Combine like terms: $2x^2 - 6x + 6x - 18 = 2x^2 - 18$

The `ring` tactic can handle these algebraic manipulations automatically, proving that $(x+3)(2x-6) = 2x^2 - 18$.

However, if we want to show the steps more explicitly, we could also prove this theorem by:

- Using `calc` to create a chain of equalities
- Expanding the left-hand side using `ring`
- Verifying that it equals the right-hand side using `ring` again

For example:

```tactics
calc
  (x + 3) * (2 * x - 6) = 2 * x ^ 2 - 18 := by ring
```

This would be sufficient because the `ring` tactic can prove the equality directly by performing the algebraic expansion and simplification.

The key insight in this problem is that the expression $(x+3)(2x-6)$ can be expanded to $2x^2 - 18$ through standard algebraic techniques. The $x^2$ term comes from multiplying $x$ by $2x$, and the constant term $-18$ comes from multiplying $3$ by $-6$. The middle terms $-6x$ and $6x$ cancel each other out, resulting in no $x$ term in the final expression.
