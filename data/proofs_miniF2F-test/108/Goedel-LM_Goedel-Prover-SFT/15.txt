  To expand the expression \((x + 3)(2x - 6)\) and show that it equals \(2x^2 - 18\), we proceed as follows:
  1. Distribute each term in the first binomial across the terms in the second binomial.
  2. Combine like terms to simplify the expression.
  3. Verify that the simplified expression matches \(2x^2 - 18\).
  -/
  -- Distribute each term in the first binomial across the terms in the second binomial.
  simp only [add_mul, mul_sub, mul_one, mul_neg, mul_assoc, mul_comm, sub_neg_eq_add]
  -- Combine like terms to simplify the expression.
  ring_nf
  -- Verify that the simplified expression matches 2x^2 - 18.
