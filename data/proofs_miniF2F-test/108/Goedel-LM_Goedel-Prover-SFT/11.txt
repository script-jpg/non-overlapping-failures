  To prove that \((x+3)(2x-6) = 2x^2 - 18\), we start by expanding the left-hand side using the distributive property. We then simplify the resulting expression step by step, combining like terms and ensuring that the equation holds true.
  1. Expand \((x+3)(2x-6)\) using the distributive property:
     \[
     (x+3)(2x-6) = x \cdot 2x + x \cdot (-6) + 3 \cdot 2x + 3 \cdot (-6)
     \]
  2. Simplify each term:
     \[
     x \cdot 2x = 2x^2
     \]
     \[
     x \cdot (-6) = -6x
     \]
     \[
     3 \cdot 2x = 6x
     \]
     \[
     3 \cdot (-6) = -18
     \]
  3. Combine the simplified terms:
     \[
     2x^2 - 6x + 6x - 18 = 2x^2 - 18
     \]
  Thus, we have shown that \((x+3)(2x-6) = 2x^2 - 18\).
