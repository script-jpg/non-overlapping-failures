  To expand the expression \((x + 3)(2x - 6)\) and show that it equals \(2x^2 - 18\), we proceed as follows:
  1. Distribute each term in the first binomial to each term in the second binomial.
  2. Combine like terms to simplify the expression.
  3. Verify that the simplified expression matches the target expression \(2x^2 - 18\).
