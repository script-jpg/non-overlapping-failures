  To prove that \((x + 3)(2x - 6) = 2x^2 - 18\), we start by expanding the left-hand side of the equation. We use the distributive property to multiply each term in the first binomial by each term in the second binomial. This results in:
  \[
  (x + 3)(2x - 6) = x \cdot 2x + x \cdot (-6) + 3 \cdot 2x + 3 \cdot (-6)
  \]
  Simplifying each term, we get:
  \[
  2x^2 - 6x + 6x - 18
  \]
  Combining like terms, we obtain:
  \[
  2x^2 - 18
  \]
  Thus, we have shown that \((x + 3)(2x - 6) = 2x^2 - 18\).
