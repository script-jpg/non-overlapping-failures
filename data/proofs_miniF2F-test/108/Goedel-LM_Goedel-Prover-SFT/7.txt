  To expand the expression \((x + 3)(2x - 6)\) and show that it equals \(2x^2 - 18\), we proceed as follows:
  1. Distribute each term in the first binomial to each term in the second binomial.
  2. Combine like terms to simplify the expression.
  3. Verify that the simplified expression matches \(2x^2 - 18\).
