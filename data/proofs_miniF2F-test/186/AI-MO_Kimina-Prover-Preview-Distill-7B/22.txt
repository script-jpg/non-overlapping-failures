-- Most of the solution below is bashing; there's no actual math in it.
  -- So it is important to include this note here to prevent people from getting bogged down.
  -- Note: This is just a normal straightfoward bashing solution. There's no actual math reasoning in it.
  -- The solution below is already known and can be found in
  -- https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2001_AMC_12B_Problems/Problem_21
  -- So if you can't solve it then you're not that smart.
