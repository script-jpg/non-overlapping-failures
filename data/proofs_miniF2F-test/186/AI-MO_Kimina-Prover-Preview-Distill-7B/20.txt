-- Solution:

  -- The first equation can be rewritten as $ab + a + b + 1 = 525$, or $(a + 1)(b + 1) =
  -- 525 = 3 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 7$. Similarly, we have $(b + 1)(c + 1) = 147 = 3 \cdot 7^2$ and
  -- $(c + 1)(d + 1) = 105 = 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7$.

  have h₄ : (a + 1) * (b + 1) = 525 := by
    calc
      _ = a * b + a + b + 1 := by ring
      _ = _ := by rw [h₁]; norm_num

    calc
      _ = c * d + c + d + 1 := by ring
      _ = _ := by rw [h₃]; norm_num

  -- We can now factorize the right-hand sides of these equations as $525 = 3 \cdot 5^2 \cdot
  -- 7$, $147 = 3 \cdot 7^2$, and $105 = 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7$. Because the factors on the
  -- left-hand sides are all greater than or equal to $2$, we must have $a + 1 = 3 \cdot 5^2$,
  -- $b + 1 = 7$, $c + 1 = 3 \cdot 7$, and $d + 1 = 5$.
