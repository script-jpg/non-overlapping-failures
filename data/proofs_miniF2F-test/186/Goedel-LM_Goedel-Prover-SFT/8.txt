  Given four positive integers \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) with a product of \(8!\) and satisfying the equations:
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  ab + a + b &= 524 \\
  bc + b + c &= 146 \\
  cd + c + d &= 104
  \end{align*}
  \]
  we need to determine \(a - d\).
  First, we calculate \(8!\):
  \[
  8! = 40320
  \]
  Given the constraints, we can use the fact that the product of the integers is \(40320\). We also know the relationships between the products and sums:
  \[
  ab + a + b = 524, \quad bc + b + c = 146, \quad cd + c + d = 104
  \]
  By manipulating these equations, we can derive the values of \(a\) and \(d\) and thus find \(a - d\).
