  -- We know that `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are positive and that `a * b * c * d = 40320`.
  -- We also know that for each of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, the sum of their pairwise products plus themselves
  -- is less than or equal to the given sums.
  -- We need to find the exact values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` that satisfy these conditions.
