  Given four positive integers \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) with a product of \(8!\) and satisfying the equations:
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  ab + a + b &= 524 \\
  bc + b + c &= 146 \\
  cd + c + d &= 104
  \end{align*}
  \]
  We need to determine \(a - d\).
  First, we compute \(8!\) which is \(40320\). By substituting this value into the product equation, we get:
  \[
  a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d = 40320
  \]
  Next, we use the given equations to form a system of equations. We solve for \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) using these equations. By simplifying and solving the system, we find that:
  \[
  a - d = 10
  \]
