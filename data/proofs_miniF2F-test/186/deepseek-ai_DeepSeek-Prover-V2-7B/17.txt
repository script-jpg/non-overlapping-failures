  -- We need to find the value of a - d. We will use the given equations to derive this.
  -- First, we will express each variable in terms of the others.
  -- From the first equation: ab + a + b = 524
  -- We can factor this as (a + 1)(b + 1) = 525
  -- Similarly, from the other equations:
  -- (b + 1)(c + 1) = 147
  -- (c + 1)(d + 1) = 105
  -- We will now find the values of a, b, c, and d that satisfy these equations.
  -- We start by finding the prime factorizations of 525, 147, and 105.
  -- 525 = 3 × 5^2 × 7
  -- 147 = 3 × 7^2
  -- 105 = 3 × 5 × 7
  -- Using these factorizations, we can find the values of a, b, c, and d.
  -- From (a + 1)(b + 1) = 525, we have a + 1 = 25 and b + 1 = 21, giving a = 24 and b = 20.
  -- From (b + 1)(c + 1) = 147, we have b + 1 = 21 and c + 1 = 7, giving b = 20 and c = 6.
  -- From (c + 1)(d + 1) = 105, we have c + 1 = 7 and d + 1 = 15, giving c = 6 and d = 14.
  -- Finally, we calculate a - d = 24 - 14 = 10.
  -- Therefore, the correct answer is 10.
