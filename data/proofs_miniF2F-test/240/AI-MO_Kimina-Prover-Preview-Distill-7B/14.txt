-- What is the remainder when $n$ is divided by 5? It is given as hypothesis that the remainder is 3.
  -- So we can write $n = 5k + 3$ for some integer $k$.
  have : n % 5 = 3 := h₀

  -- Now, what is the remainder when twice the number, $2n$, is divided by 5? We can compute $2n = 2(5k + 3) = 10k + 6$.
  -- When we divide $2n$ by 5, the remainder is the remainder of $10k + 6$ divided by 5. Since $10k$ is divisible by 5, the remainder is the remainder of 6 divided by 5, which is 1.
  have : 2 * n % 5 = 1 := by
    -- The remainder of $2n$ when divided by 5 equals the remainder of $2 \times 3$ when divided by 5, because the remainder of $n$ when divided by 5 is 3.
    rw [Nat.mul_mod, this]
    -- The remainder of $2 \times 3$ when divided by 5 is 6 when divided by 5, which gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 1.

  -- So the remainder when $2n$ is divided by 5 is 1.
