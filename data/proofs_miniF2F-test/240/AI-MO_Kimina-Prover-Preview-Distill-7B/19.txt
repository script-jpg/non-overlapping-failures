-- The problem states that when $n$ is divided by 5, the remainder is 3: $n \equiv 3 \pmod{5}$.
  -- We need to find the remainder when $2n$ is divided by 5, i.e., $2n \bmod 5$.

  -- To solve this, we can use the properties of modular arithmetic.
  -- If $n \equiv 3 \pmod{5}$, then multiplying both sides by 2 gives $2n \equiv 2 \cdot 3 \pmod{5}$.
  have h₁ : 2 * n % 5 = 2 * (n % 5) % 5 := by
    simp [Nat.mul_mod, Nat.mod_mod]

  -- Substituting the given condition $n \equiv 3 \pmod{5}$ into the equation, we get $2n \equiv 2 \cdot 3 \pmod{5}$.
  rw [h₁, h₀]

  -- Simplifying the right-hand side, we have $2 \cdot 3 = 6$, and $6 \bmod 5 = 1$.
  -- Therefore, $2n \equiv 1 \pmod{5}$, which means the remainder when $2n$ is divided by 5 is 1.
