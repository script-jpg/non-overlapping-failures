-- What is the remainder when a number is divided by 5 is the same as the remainder when that number is divided by 10.
  -- remainder when divided by 5 can be 0,1,2,3,4. remainder when divided by 10 can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.
  -- So we can consider only the cases where n % 10 is 3,8,13,18.
  -- It is easy to draw a table for the remainders.
  -- n % 10  n % 5  2 * n % 5
  -- -----------------------------
  -- 3        3        1
  -- 8        3        1
  -- 13       3        1
  -- 18       3        1
  -- So the remainder is always 1.
