-- What is the remainder when $n$ is divided by 5? The answer is 3, because $n = 5k + 3$ for some integer $k$.
  have h₁ : n % 5 = 3 := h₀

  -- The remainder when $2n$ is divided by 5 must be $2 \cdot (n \bmod 5) = 2 \cdot 3 = 6$, but since we're looking for a
  -- remainder when divided by 5, we have to subtract 5, giving us a remainder of 1.
  have h₂ : 2 * n % 5 = 2 * (n % 5) % 5 := Nat.mul_mod 2 n 5
  rw [h₁] at h₂
  norm_num at h₂
  exact h₂
