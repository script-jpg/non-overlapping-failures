-- What is the remainder when $n$ is divided by 5? It is $3$, says the hypothesis.

  -- What is the remainder when $2n$ is divided by 5? It is $2 \times 3 = 6$, but $6$ is greater than $5$.
  -- So we take $6 - 5 = 1$ and say the remainder is $1$.

  have : 2 * n % 5 = 1 := by

    -- We know that $n \equiv 3 \pmod{5}$. Multiplying both sides of the congruence by $2$, we get
    -- $2n \equiv 2 \times 3 \pmod{5}$.
    rw [Nat.mul_mod, h₀]

    -- But $2 \times 3 = 6$ and $6 \equiv 1 \pmod{5}$, so we get $2n \equiv 1 \pmod{5}$.

  -- Hence, the remainder when $2n$ is divided by $5$ is $1$.
