-- We have $n = 5k + 3$ for some integer $k$. Then $2n = 2(5k + 3) = 10k + 6 = 5(2k + 1) + 1$. So when $2n$ is divided by 5, the remainder is 1.

This theorem states that if a natural number $n$ gives a remainder of 3 when divided by 5, then $2n$ gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 5. The proof is straightforward using modular arithmetic properties.

When $n$ is divided by 5, the remainder is 3. This means $n \equiv 3 \pmod{5}$. Multiplying both sides by 2 gives $2n \equiv 2 \cdot 3 \pmod{5} \equiv 6 \pmod{5} \equiv 1 \pmod{5}$. Therefore, the remainder when $2n$ is divided by 5 is 1.

The Lean proof uses `Nat.mul_mod` to handle the multiplication of natural numbers modulo 5, and then substitutes our hypothesis `h₀ : n % 5 = 3` to compute the result directly.

So the complete answer is: The remainder when twice the number is divided by 5 is 1.
