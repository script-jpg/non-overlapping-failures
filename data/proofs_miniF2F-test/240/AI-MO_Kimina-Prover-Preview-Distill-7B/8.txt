When a number $n$ is divided by 5 and leaves a remainder of 3, we have $n \equiv 3 \pmod{5}$. This means that $n = 5k + 3$ for some integer $k$. If we double this number, we get $2n = 2(5k + 3) = 10k + 6$. When $2n$ is divided by 5, the remainder is $6 \mod 5 = 1$. 

More formally, we can calculate $2n \bmod 5$ directly from $n \bmod 5$ using the properties of modular arithmetic:
$2n \bmod 5 = (2 \cdot (n \bmod 5)) \bmod 5 = (2 \cdot 3) \bmod 5 = 6 \bmod 5 = 1$.

So the remainder when twice the number is divided by 5 is 1.
