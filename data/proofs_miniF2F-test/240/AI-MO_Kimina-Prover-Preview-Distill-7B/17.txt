The proof proceeds by first noting that if $n \equiv 3 \pmod{5}$, then $2n \equiv 2 \cdot 3 \equiv 6 \equiv 1 \pmod{5}$. The key insight is that when we multiply both sides of a congruence by a constant, we must also multiply the modulus by that constant. Here, we multiplied both sides of $n \equiv 3 \pmod{5}$ by 2 to get $2n \equiv 2 \cdot 3 \equiv 6 \equiv 1 \pmod{5}$. The Lean proof uses `Nat.mul_mod` to formalize this step. The lemma `Nat.mul_mod` states that $(a \cdot b) \mod m = ((a \mod m) \cdot (b \mod m)) \mod m$. In this case, we have $a = 2$, $b = n$, and $m = 5$. Since $2 \mod 5 = 2$ and $n \mod 5 = 3$, we get $(2 \cdot 3) \mod 5 = 6 \mod 5 = 1$.
