-- We have $n = 5k + 3$ for some integer $k$. So $2n = 2(5k + 3) = 10k + 6 = 10k + 5 + 1 = 5(2k + 1) + 1$. Thus $2n$ has remainder 1 when divided by 5.

In this proof, we start with the given fact that $n \equiv 3 \pmod{5}$. We want to find $2n \bmod 5$. 

A key property of modular arithmetic is that we can substitute the remainder of $n$ when computing $2n \bmod 5$:
$2n \equiv 2 \cdot (n \bmod 5) \equiv 2 \cdot 3 \equiv 6 \equiv 1 \pmod{5}$.

Let's walk through the Lean 4 proof:

1. The theorem states that if $n \bmod 5 = 3$, then $2n \bmod 5 = 1$.
2. We need to calculate $2n \bmod 5$. Using the properties of modular arithmetic, we know that $2n \bmod 5 = (2 \cdot (n \bmod 5)) \bmod 5$.
3. Since $n \bmod 5 = 3$, we substitute to get $(2 \cdot 3) \bmod 5 = 6 \bmod 5 = 1$.
4. In Lean, we can prove this by:
   - Importing the necessary libraries
   - Opening namespaces for big operators, real numbers, natural numbers, topology, and rational numbers
   - Setting the maximum heartbeats to 0 (allowing Lean to run longer if necessary)
   - Opening the BigOperators namespace for mathematical notation
5. Writing the theorem statement
6. Proving it by calculation:
   - `2 * n % 5 = (2 * (n % 5)) % 5` by the property of modular multiplication
   - `= (2 * 3) % 5` by substituting the hypothesis
   - `= 6 % 5` by evaluating the multiplication
   - `= 1` by computing the remainder

The Lean proof is remarkably concise because it directly applies fundamental properties of modular arithmetic that are already available in Lean's library. The calculation is straightforward: if $n \equiv 3 \pmod{5}$, then $2n \equiv 2 \cdot 3 \equiv 6 \equiv 1 \pmod{5}$.

Therefore, the remainder when twice the number is divided by 5 is 1.
