-- What is the remainder when twice the number is divided by 5?

  have h₁ : 2 * n % 5 = 2 * (n % 5) % 5 := by

    -- This is the same as the remainder of $2 * n$ divided by $2 * 5$.

    rw [Nat.mul_mod]

  rw [h₁, h₀]

  -- The remainder when $2 * n$ is divided by $5$ is the same as the remainder of $2 * 3$ divided by $5$.

  rw [show 2 * (3 : ℕ) % 5 = 6 % 5 by norm_num]

  -- remainder of $6$ divided by $5$ is $1$.
