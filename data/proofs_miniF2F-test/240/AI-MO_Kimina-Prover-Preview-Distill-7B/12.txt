This theorem states that if a natural number $n$ gives a remainder of 3 when divided by 5, then $2n$ gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 5. Let's prove this number theory problem step by step.

First, I'll analyze what we're given: $n \equiv 3 \pmod{5}$. This means that when $n$ is divided by 5, the remainder is 3. We need to find $2n \bmod 5$.

The key insight is to use the properties of modular arithmetic. Specifically, we can use the fact that if $a \equiv b \pmod{m}$, then for any integer $k$, $ka \equiv kb \pmod{m}$.

So, from $n \equiv 3 \pmod{5}$, multiplying both sides by 2 gives $2n \equiv 2 \cdot 3 \pmod{5}$.

Let me start the formal Lean 4 proof:

We've imported the necessary libraries and opened the relevant namespaces. Now let's define the theorem:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_185 (n : ℕ) (h₀ : n % 5 = 3) : 2 * n % 5 = 1 := by
```

The theorem is now declared. We have a natural number $n$ with the hypothesis $h₀: n \% 5 = 3$, and we need to prove that $2 * n \% 5 = 1$.

To solve this, I'll use the property that if $n \equiv 3 \pmod{5}$, then $2n \equiv 2 \cdot 3 \pmod{5}$. Let's compute $2 \cdot 3 = 6$, and $6 \bmod 5 = 1$.

In Lean, we can use the `Nat.mul_mod` lemma which states that $(a \cdot b) \% m = ((a \% m) \cdot (b \% m)) \% m$:

```tactics
have h₁ : 2 * n % 5 = 1 := by
  rw [Nat.mul_mod]
  rw [h₀]
  norm_num
```

So our complete proof is:
1. We have $n \equiv 3 \pmod{5}$ from hypothesis $h₀$.
2. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get $2n \equiv 2 \cdot 3 \pmod{5}$.
3. Compute $2 \cdot 3 = 6$ and $6 \bmod 5 = 1$ using Lean's `norm_num`.
4. Therefore, $2n \equiv 1 \pmod{5}$, which is exactly what we needed to prove.

The final answer is 1, which is $\boxed{1}$ in the informal solution.
