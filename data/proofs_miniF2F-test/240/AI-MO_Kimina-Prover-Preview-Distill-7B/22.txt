-- When a number is divided by 5, the remainder is 3. What is the remainder when twice the number is divided by 5? Show that it is 1.

  have h₁ : 2 * n % 5 = 1 := by

    rw [Nat.mul_mod]

    rw [h₀]

    exact rfl

  exact h₁

The key insight is that we can manipulate congruences using the properties of modular arithmetic. If $n \equiv 3 \pmod{5}$, then multiplying both sides of the congruence by 2 gives us $2n \equiv 2 \cdot 3 \pmod{5}$. Calculating $2 \cdot 3 \bmod 5$ gives us $6 \bmod 5 = 1$. Therefore, $2n \equiv 1 \pmod{5}$, which means the remainder when twice the number is divided by 5 is 1.

This problem demonstrates the fundamental property of modular arithmetic that if $a \equiv b \pmod{m}$, then for any integer $k$, $ka \equiv kb \pmod{m}$. In this case, we have $n \equiv 3 \pmod{5}$, and multiplying by 2 gives $2n \equiv 2 \cdot 3 \pmod{5} \equiv 6 \pmod{5} \equiv 1 \pmod{5}$.

The Lean proof elegantly captures this reasoning by:
1. Starting from the hypothesis $n \bmod 5 = 3$ (h₀)
2. Using the property that $(a \cdot b) \bmod m = ((a \bmod m) \cdot (b \bmod m)) \bmod m$ (Nat.mul_mod)
3. Substituting $a = 2$ and $b = n$ into this property
4. Calculating $2 \bmod 5 = 2$ (implicit in Nat.mul_mod)
5. Computing $(2 \cdot (n \bmod 5)) \bmod 5 = (2 \cdot 3) \bmod 5 = 6 \bmod 5 = 1$
6. Concluding that $2n \bmod 5 = 1$, which is exactly our goal

The Lean proof is concise because it directly follows from the basic properties of modular arithmetic. The theorem statement captures the problem precisely, and the proof applies the standard rules of modular arithmetic to derive the answer.
