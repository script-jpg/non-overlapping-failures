  Given a natural number \( n \) such that \( n \mod 5 = 3 \), we need to show that \( 2n \mod 5 = 1 \). We start by expressing \( 2n \mod 5 \) using the properties of modular arithmetic. Specifically, we use the fact that \( 2n \mod 5 \) can be rewritten as \( 2 \times (n \mod 5) \mod 5 \). Given \( n \mod 5 = 3 \), we substitute this into the expression to get \( 2 \times 3 \mod 5 \). Simplifying this, we find that \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \), and \( 6 \mod 5 = 1 \). Thus, the remainder when \( 2n \) is divided by 5 is indeed 1.
