  Given a natural number \( n \) such that \( n \mod 5 = 3 \), we need to show that \( 2n \mod 5 = 1 \).
  1. Start with the given condition \( n \mod 5 = 3 \).
  2. Compute \( 2n \mod 5 \) by expressing \( 2n \) as \( 2(n \mod 5 + 5k) \) for some integer \( k \).
  3. Substitute \( n \mod 5 = 3 \) into the expression to get \( 2(3 + 5k) \).
  4. Simplify the expression modulo 5: \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \), and \( 6 \mod 5 = 1 \).
  5. Thus, \( 2n \mod 5 = 1 \).
