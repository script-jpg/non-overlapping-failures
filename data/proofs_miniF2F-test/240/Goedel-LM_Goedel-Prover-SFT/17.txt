  Given that the remainder when a number \( n \) is divided by 5 is 3, we need to determine the remainder when twice the number \( 2n \) is divided by 5. We will show that this remainder is 1.
  1. Start with the given condition: \( n \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \).
  2. Multiply both sides of the congruence by 2: \( 2n \equiv 2 \cdot 3 \pmod{5} \).
  3. Simplify the right-hand side: \( 2 \cdot 3 = 6 \).
  4. Find the remainder of 6 when divided by 5: \( 6 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \).
  5. Therefore, \( 2n \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \), which means the remainder when \( 2n \) is divided by 5 is 1.
