  Given that when a number \( n \) is divided by 5, the remainder is 3, we need to determine the remainder when twice the number \( 2n \) is divided by 5. We start by expressing \( 2n \) in terms of its modulo 5 equivalent. Using the property of modular arithmetic, we can rewrite \( 2n \) as \( 2(n \mod 5 + 5k) \) for some integer \( k \). Since \( n \mod 5 = 3 \), this simplifies to \( 2(3 + 5k) \). Distributing the 2, we get \( 6 + 10k \). Taking the modulo 5 of this expression, we find that \( 6 + 10k \equiv 1 \mod 5 \), thus confirming that the remainder when \( 2n \) is divided by 5 is 1.
