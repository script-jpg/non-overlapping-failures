  Given that \( n \) divided by 5 leaves a remainder of 3, we need to determine the remainder when \( 2n \) is divided by 5. We start by expressing \( n \) in the form \( 5k + 3 \) for some integer \( k \). Multiplying both sides by 2, we get \( 2n = 2(5k + 3) = 10k + 6 \). We then find the remainder of \( 10k + 6 \) when divided by 5. Since \( 10k \) is a multiple of 5, it has a remainder of 0 when divided by 5. Therefore, the remainder of \( 10k + 6 \) is the same as the remainder of 6 when divided by 5, which is 1. Thus, the remainder when \( 2n \) is divided by 5 is 1.
