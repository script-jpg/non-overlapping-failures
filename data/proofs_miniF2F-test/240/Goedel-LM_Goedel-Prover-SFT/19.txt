  Given a natural number \( n \) such that when \( n \) is divided by 5, the remainder is 3, we need to determine the remainder when \( 2n \) is divided by 5. We will show that the remainder is 1.
  1. Start with the given condition: \( n \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \).
  2. Multiply both sides of the congruence by 2: \( 2n \equiv 2 \cdot 3 \pmod{5} \).
  3. Simplify the right-hand side: \( 2 \cdot 3 = 6 \).
  4. Compute the remainder of 6 when divided by 5: \( 6 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \).
  5. Therefore, \( 2n \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \), which means the remainder when \( 2n \) is divided by 5 is 1.

  -- Given that n % 5 = 3, we use this fact in the proof.
  have h₁ : n % 5 = 3 := h₀
  -- We rewrite 2 * n % 5 using the property of modular arithmetic.
