  Given that \( n \) when divided by 5 leaves a remainder of 3, we need to determine the remainder when \( 2n \) is divided by 5. We start by expressing \( n \) in the form \( 5k + 3 \) for some integer \( k \). Then, we compute \( 2n \) as \( 2(5k + 3) = 10k + 6 \). When this is divided by 5, the term \( 10k \) is divisible by 5, leaving a remainder of 0. Thus, the remainder of \( 2n \) when divided by 5 is the same as the remainder of 6 when divided by 5, which is 1.

  -- We use the fact that 2 * n % 5 can be rewritten using the modulo operation.
  rw [Nat.mul_mod]
  -- Simplify using the given condition h₀: n % 5 = 3.
  simp [h₀, Nat.mul_mod, Nat.add_mod, Nat.mod_mod]
  -- The above simplification shows that 2 * n % 5 = 1, which completes the proof.
