  Given a natural number \( n \) such that when \( n \) is divided by 5, the remainder is 3, we need to determine the remainder when \( 2n \) is divided by 5. We start by expressing \( 2n \) as \( 2n = 2(n + 5k) \) for some integer \( k \). Using the properties of modular arithmetic, we know that \( n \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \). Therefore, we can write \( n = 5k + 3 \) for some integer \( k \). Substituting this into \( 2n \), we get:
  \[
  2n = 2(5k + 3) = 10k + 6
  \]
  Next, we need to find the remainder of \( 10k + 6 \) when divided by 5. Since \( 10k \) is a multiple of 5, it has a remainder of 0 when divided by 5. Thus, we only need to consider the remainder of 6 when divided by 5, which is 1. Therefore, the remainder when \( 2n \) is divided by 5 is 1.
