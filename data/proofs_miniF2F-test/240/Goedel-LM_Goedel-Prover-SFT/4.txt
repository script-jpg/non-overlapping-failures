  Given that when a number \( n \) is divided by 5, the remainder is 3, we need to determine the remainder when twice the number \( 2n \) is divided by 5. We start by expressing \( n \) in the form \( 5k + 3 \) for some integer \( k \). Then, we compute \( 2n \) as \( 2(5k + 3) = 10k + 6 \). When this expression is divided by 5, the term \( 10k \) is divisible by 5, leaving a remainder of 0. Thus, the remainder of \( 10k + 6 \) when divided by 5 is the same as the remainder of 6 when divided by 5, which is 1.
