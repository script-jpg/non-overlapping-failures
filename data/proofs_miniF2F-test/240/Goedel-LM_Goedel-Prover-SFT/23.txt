  Given that \( n \) is a natural number such that \( n \mod 5 = 3 \), we need to show that \( 2n \mod 5 = 1 \).
  1. Start by expressing \( 2n \mod 5 \) in terms of \( n \mod 5 \).
  2. Use the property of modular arithmetic that states \( (a \cdot b) \mod c = ((a \mod c) \cdot (b \mod c)) \mod c \).
  3. Substitute \( c = 5 \) into the property to get \( (2 \cdot n) \mod 5 = (2 \cdot (n \mod 5)) \mod 5 \).
  4. Substitute \( n \mod 5 = 3 \) into the equation to get \( (2 \cdot 3) \mod 5 \).
  5. Simplify the expression to get \( 6 \mod 5 \).
  6. Since \( 6 \mod 5 = 1 \), we have shown that \( 2n \mod 5 = 1 \).
