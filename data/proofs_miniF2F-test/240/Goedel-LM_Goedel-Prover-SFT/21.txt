  Given that \( n \) leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 5, we need to determine the remainder when \( 2n \) is divided by 5. We start by expressing \( n \) in the form \( 5k + 3 \) for some integer \( k \). Then, we compute \( 2n \) as \( 2(5k + 3) = 10k + 6 \). When \( 10k + 6 \) is divided by 5, the term \( 10k \) is divisible by 5, leaving a remainder of 0. Thus, the remainder of \( 2n \) when divided by 5 is the same as the remainder of 6 when divided by 5, which is 1.

  -- We start by using the given information that n % 5 = 3.
  have h₁ := congr_arg (· % 5) (two_mul n)
  -- Simplify the expression using properties of modular arithmetic.
  simp [mul_mod, Nat.add_mod, Nat.mod_eq_of_lt, h₀] at h₁
  -- The above simplification shows that (2 * n) % 5 = 1, which is the desired result.
  exact h₁
