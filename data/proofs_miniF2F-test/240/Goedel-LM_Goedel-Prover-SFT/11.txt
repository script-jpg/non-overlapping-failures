  Given that \( n \) is a natural number such that \( n \mod 5 = 3 \), we need to determine the remainder when \( 2n \) is divided by 5. We start by expressing \( 2n \) in terms of its modulo 5 equivalent. Using the property of modular arithmetic, we can write \( 2n \) as \( 2(n \mod 5 + 5k) \) for some integer \( k \). Substituting \( n \mod 5 = 3 \) into this expression, we get \( 2(3 + 5k) \). Simplifying this, we find that \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \), and since \( 6 \mod 5 = 1 \), the remainder when \( 2n \) is divided by 5 is 1.
