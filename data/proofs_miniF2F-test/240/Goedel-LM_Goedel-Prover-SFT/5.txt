  Given that when a number \( n \) is divided by 5, the remainder is 3, we need to determine the remainder when twice the number is divided by 5. We start by expressing \( n \) in the form \( 5k + 3 \) for some integer \( k \). Then, we compute \( 2n \) as \( 2(5k + 3) = 10k + 6 \). When this expression is divided by 5, the term \( 10k \) is divisible by 5, leaving a remainder of 0. Thus, the remainder of \( 2n \) when divided by 5 is the same as the remainder of 6 when divided by 5, which is 1.

  have h₁ := congr_arg (· % 5) (Nat.add_mod n 5)
  -- Simplify the expression to show that the remainder of n when divided by 5 is 3.
  simp at h₁
  -- Compute 2n and simplify the expression modulo 5.
  simp [h₀, Nat.mul_mod, Nat.add_mod, Nat.mod_eq_of_lt, show 2 < 5 by norm_num] at h₁ ⊢
  -- Use the omega tactic to solve the resulting linear congruence.
