  Given that \( n \) divided by 5 leaves a remainder of 3, we need to determine the remainder when \( 2n \) is divided by 5. We start by expressing \( n \) in the form \( n = 5k + 3 \) for some integer \( k \). Then, we compute \( 2n \):
  \[
  2n = 2(5k + 3) = 10k + 6
  \]
  Next, we find the remainder of \( 10k + 6 \) when divided by 5:
  \[
  10k + 6 \equiv 0k + 6 \equiv 6 \equiv 1 \pmod{5}
  \]
  Thus, the remainder when \( 2n \) is divided by 5 is 1.
