  Given that \( n \) divided by 5 leaves a remainder of 3, we need to determine the remainder when \( 2n \) is divided by 5. We start by expressing \( 2n \) as \( 2(n + 5k) \) for some integer \( k \). Using the properties of modular arithmetic, we can simplify this expression modulo 5. Specifically, we use the fact that \( 2n \equiv 2(n \mod 5) \mod 5 \). Given \( n \mod 5 = 3 \), we substitute this into the expression to find that \( 2n \mod 5 = 2 \times 3 \mod 5 = 6 \mod 5 = 1 \).
