  Given that \( n \) leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 5, we need to determine the remainder when \( 2n \) is divided by 5. We start by expressing \( n \) in the form \( 5k + 3 \) for some integer \( k \). Then, we compute \( 2n \) as \( 2(5k + 3) = 10k + 6 \). When this expression is divided by 5, the term \( 10k \) is divisible by 5, leaving a remainder of 0. Thus, the remainder of \( 10k + 6 \) when divided by 5 is the same as the remainder of 6 when divided by 5, which is 1.

  -- We start by expressing n in the form 5k + 3 for some integer k.
  have h₁ := congr_arg (fun n => n % 5) (Nat.mod_add_div n 5)
  -- Simplify the expression using the given remainder and properties of modular arithmetic.
  simp [h₀, Nat.mul_mod, Nat.add_mod] at h₁
  -- Use the omega tactic to solve the resulting linear congruence.
