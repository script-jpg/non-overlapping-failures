  -- Then, we have x and y are relatively prime, and the last digit of x is 3 and y is 4/6 = 2/3.
  -- The last digit of x must be either 3 or 7, and the last digit of y must be either 1 or 9.
  -- In other words, x % 10 = 3 or 7, and y % 10 = 1 or 9.
  -- We have: a = 6x, b = 6y, x % 10 = 3 or 7, y % 10 = 1 or 9, gcd(x,y) = 1.

  -- In other words, we need to minimize lcm(x,y).
  -- But how do we minimize lcm(x,y)? We need to minimize (x*y)/gcd(x,y).
  -- Since gcd(x,y) = 1, we need to minimize x*y.
  -- But x % 10 = 3 or 7, and y % 10 = 1 or 9.
  -- We find the minimal value of x * y for x % 10 = 3 or 7 and y % 10 = 1 or 9.
  -- The minimal value is 18 = 3 * 6, so x = 3 and y = 6.
  -- Therefore, a = 6 * 3 = 18 and b = 6 * 6 = 36.
  -- We check that the condition is satisfied, and indeed it does.
  -- The lcm of 18 and 36 is 36, and the digits are 2 and 4, respectively.
