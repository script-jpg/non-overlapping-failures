-- -- Note that $6$ must divide $a$ and $b$, so $3$ must divide $a$ and $b$. This implies that $3$
  -- must divide the units digit of $a$ and $b$. However, this it is impossible since $2$ and $4$ are not
  -- divisible by $3$. Thus, $6$ cannot divide $a$ or $b$, which is a contradiction. Therefore, there
  -- are no such positive integers $a$ and $b$.
