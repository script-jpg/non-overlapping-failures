  Given positive integers \(a\) and \(b\) such that the units digit of \(a\) is 2, the units digit of \(b\) is 4, and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(a\) and \(b\) is 6, we need to determine the smallest possible value of the least common multiple (lcm) of \(a\) and \(b\).
  First, we use the property that the product of the gcd and lcm of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. Therefore, we have:
  \[ \text{gcd}(a, b) \times \text{lcm}(a, b) = a \times b \]
  Given that the gcd of \(a\) and \(b\) is 6, we can express this as:
  \[ 6 \times \text{lcm}(a, b) = a \times b \]
  Next, we use the fact that the units digit of \(a\) is 2 and the units digit of \(b\) is 4. We can write \(a\) and \(b\) as:
  \[ a = 10k + 2 \]
  \[ b = 10m + 4 \]
  for some integers \(k\) and \(m\).
  Substituting these into the gcd equation, we get:
  \[ \text{gcd}(10k + 2, 10m + 4) = 6 \]
  Since the gcd of two numbers is the same as the gcd of their units digits, we have:
  \[ \text{gcd}(2, 4) = 6 \]
  This is true. Now, we need to find the lcm of \(a\) and \(b\). Using the relationship:
  \[ \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{gcd}(a, b)} \]
  Substituting the known values:
  \[ \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{(10k + 2) \times (10m + 4)}{6} \]
  To find the smallest possible value, we need to ensure that the product of \(a\) and \(b\) is minimized. Given the constraints, the smallest values for \(a\) and \(b\) that satisfy the gcd condition are 12 and 14. Thus:
  \[ \text{lcm}(12, 14) = \frac{12 \times 14}{6} = 28 \]
  However, this is not the correct approach. Instead, we need to consider the smallest possible values that satisfy the gcd condition and then find the lcm. The correct values are 12 and 14, leading to:
  \[ \text{lcm}(12, 14) = 108 \]
  Thus, the smallest possible value of the lcm of \(a\) and \(b\) is 108.
