  Given positive integers \(a\) and \(b\) such that the units digit of \(a\) is 2, the units digit of \(b\) is 4, and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(a\) and \(b\) is 6, we need to find the smallest possible value of the least common multiple (lcm) of \(a\) and \(b\).
  First, we use the relationship between the gcd and lcm of two numbers, which states that the product of the numbers is equal to the product of their gcd and lcm. Specifically, we have:
  \[ \text{gcd}(a, b) \times \text{lcm}(a, b) = a \times b \]
  Given that \( \text{gcd}(a, b) = 6 \), we substitute this into the equation:
  \[ 6 \times \text{lcm}(a, b) = a \times b \]
  Next, we use the fact that the units digit of \(a\) is 2 and the units digit of \(b\) is 4. This implies that \(a\) and \(b\) can be written as:
  \[ a = 10k + 2 \]
  \[ b = 10m + 4 \]
  for some integers \(k\) and \(m\). Substituting these into the equation, we get:
  \[ 6 \times \text{lcm}(a, b) = (10k + 2)(10m + 4) \]
  Expanding the right-hand side:
  \[ 6 \times \text{lcm}(a, b) = 100km + 40k + 20m + 8 \]
  Since \( \text{lcm}(a, b) \) must be a multiple of 6, we need to find the smallest possible value of \( \text{lcm}(a, b) \). By solving the equation, we find that the smallest value of \( \text{lcm}(a, b) \) is 108.
