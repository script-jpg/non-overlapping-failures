  Given positive integers \(a\) and \(b\) such that the units digit of \(a\) is 2, the units digit of \(b\) is 4, and the greatest common divisor of \(a\) and \(b\) is 6, we need to find the smallest possible value of the least common multiple of \(a\) and \(b\).
  First, we use the relationship between the greatest common divisor (gcd) and the least common multiple (lcm) of two numbers. The product of the two numbers is equal to the product of their gcd and lcm. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
  \[ a \cdot b = \text{gcd}(a, b) \cdot \text{lcm}(a, b) \]
  Given that the gcd of \(a\) and \(b\) is 6, we substitute this into the equation:
  \[ a \cdot b = 6 \cdot \text{lcm}(a, b) \]
  Next, we use the fact that the units digit of \(a\) is 2 and the units digit of \(b\) is 4. This implies that \(a\) and \(b\) can be written as:
  \[ a = 10k + 2 \]
  \[ b = 10m + 4 \]
  for some integers \(k\) and \(m\). Substituting these into the equation \(a \cdot b = 6 \cdot \text{lcm}(a, b)\), we get:
  \[ (10k + 2)(10m + 4) = 6 \cdot \text{lcm}(a, b) \]
  Expanding the left-hand side:
  \[ 100km + 40k + 20m + 8 = 6 \cdot \text{lcm}(a, b) \]
  Since the gcd of \(a\) and \(b\) is 6, we know that \(a\) and \(b\) are multiples of 6. The smallest possible value of the lcm of \(a\) and \(b\) that satisfies these conditions is 108.
