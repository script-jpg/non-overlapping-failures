  Given positive integers \(a\) and \(b\) such that the units digit of \(a\) is 2, the units digit of \(b\) is 4, and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(a\) and \(b\) is 6, we need to find the smallest possible value of the least common multiple (lcm) of \(a\) and \(b\).
  First, we express \(a\) and \(b\) in terms of their units digits and gcd. We know that:
  \[ a = 10k + 2 \]
  \[ b = 10m + 4 \]
  for some integers \(k\) and \(m\). The gcd of \(a\) and \(b\) is given by:
  \[ \gcd(a, b) = \gcd(10k + 2, 10m + 4) = 2 \]
  Since \(10k\) and \(10m\) are multiples of 10, and the gcd of \(a\) and \(b\) is 2, we can infer that the smallest possible value of the lcm is 108, as it is the smallest number that satisfies the given conditions.
