  Given positive integers \(a\) and \(b\) such that the units digit of \(a\) is 2, the units digit of \(b\) is 4, and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(a\) and \(b\) is 6, we need to find the smallest possible value of the least common multiple (lcm) of \(a\) and \(b\).
  First, we note that the gcd of \(a\) and \(b\) is 6, which implies that both \(a\) and \(b\) are multiples of 6. Given the units digits, we can write \(a = 6k\) and \(b = 6m\) for some integers \(k\) and \(m\). The units digit of \(a\) is 2, so \(k\) must be even (since \(6k\) ends in 2). Similarly, \(m\) must be even (since \(6m\) ends in 4).
  To find the smallest lcm, we consider the smallest possible values for \(k\) and \(m\) that satisfy these conditions. The smallest even \(k\) is 2, and the smallest even \(m\) is 4. Thus, the smallest values for \(a\) and \(b\) are \(6 \times 2 = 12\) and \(6 \times 4 = 24\) respectively.
  The lcm of 12 and 24 is calculated as follows:
  \[
  \text{lcm}(12, 24) = \frac{12 \times 24}{\text{gcd}(12, 24)} = \frac{12 \times 24}{12} = 24
  \]
  However, this is incorrect. The correct smallest lcm is 108, which occurs when \(a = 18\) and \(b = 36\).

    -- We use the fact that the gcd of a and b is 6, and the lcm is the product of a and b divided by their gcd.

    -- Since a and b are multiples of 6, the smallest possible values for a and b that satisfy the conditions are 18 and 36.
    -- Therefore, the lcm of 18 and 36 is 108.
