  Given positive integers \(a\) and \(b\) such that the units digit of \(a\) is 2, the units digit of \(b\) is 4, and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(a\) and \(b\) is 6, we need to show that the smallest possible value of the least common multiple (lcm) of \(a\) and \(b\) is 108.
  1. **Unit Digits and GCD**: The units digit of \(a\) is 2, and the units digit of \(b\) is 4. The gcd of \(a\) and \(b\) is given as 6.
  2. **LCM Calculation**: The lcm of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\) can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{gcd}(a, b)}
     \]
  3. **Substitute Known Values**: Substitute \(a\) and \(b\) with their respective values, considering the units digits and the gcd.
  4. **Simplify the Expression**: Calculate the lcm using the given values and verify that it is at least 108.
