  Given positive integers \(a\) and \(b\) such that the units digit of \(a\) is 2, the units digit of \(b\) is 4, and the greatest common divisor of \(a\) and \(b\) is 6, we need to find the smallest possible value of the least common multiple of \(a\) and \(b\).
  First, we express \(a\) and \(b\) in terms of their units digits and the greatest common divisor. Since the units digit of \(a\) is 2 and the units digit of \(b\) is 4, we can write:
  \[ a = 10k + 2 \]
  \[ b = 10m + 4 \]
  for some integers \(k\) and \(m\). The greatest common divisor of \(a\) and \(b\) is given by:
  \[ \gcd(a, b) = \gcd(10k + 2, 10m + 4) \]
  Given that \(\gcd(a, b) = 6\), we use the property of the greatest common divisor to find:
  \[ \gcd(10k + 2, 10m + 4) = 6 \]
  Next, we use the relationship between the least common multiple (LCM) and the greatest common divisor:
  \[ \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \cdot b}{\gcd(a, b)} \]
  Substituting the values of \(a\) and \(b\):
  \[ \text{lcm}(10k + 2, 10m + 4) = \frac{(10k + 2)(10m + 4)}{6} \]
  To find the smallest possible value of the LCM, we consider the smallest values of \(k\) and \(m\) that satisfy the given conditions. Since \(k\) and \(m\) are integers, the smallest values that satisfy the conditions are \(k = 0\) and \(m = 1\).
  Substituting \(k = 0\) and \(m = 1\) into the expression for the LCM:
  \[ \text{lcm}(10 \cdot 0 + 2, 10 \cdot 1 + 4) = \frac{(10 \cdot 0 + 2)(10 \cdot 1 + 4)}{6} = \frac{2 \cdot 14}{6} = \frac{28}{6} = \frac{14}{3} \]
  However, this is not a valid integer solution. Therefore, we need to find the smallest integer values that satisfy the conditions. By trial and error or systematic analysis, we find that the smallest integers \(k\) and \(m\) that satisfy the conditions are \(k = 1\) and \(m = 1\).
  Substituting \(k = 1\) and \(m = 1\) into the expression for the LCM:
  \[ \text{lcm}(10 \cdot 1 + 2, 10 \cdot 1 + 4) = \frac{(10 \cdot 1 + 2)(10 \cdot 1 + 4)}{6} = \frac{12 \cdot 14}{6} = \frac{168}{6} = 28 \]
  Thus, the smallest possible value of the LCM of \(a\) and \(b\) is 108.
