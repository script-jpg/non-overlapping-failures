  Given positive integers \(a\) and \(b\) such that the units digit of \(a\) is 2, the units digit of \(b\) is 4, and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(a\) and \(b\) is 6, we need to determine the smallest possible value of the least common multiple (lcm) of \(a\) and \(b\).
  1. **Sum of Units Digits**: The units digit of \(a\) is 2, and the units digit of \(b\) is 4. Therefore, the sum of the units digits is \(2 + 4 = 6\).
  2. **GCD**: The gcd of \(a\) and \(b\) is given as 6.
  3. **LCM Calculation**: The lcm of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\) can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \cdot b}{\text{gcd}(a, b)}
     \]
     Substituting the known values:
     \[
     \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \cdot b}{6}
     \]
  4. **Minimizing the LCM**: To find the smallest possible value of the lcm, we need to consider the smallest possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) that satisfy the given conditions. Since the units digit of \(a\) is 2 and the units digit of \(b\) is 4, the smallest values for \(a\) and \(b\) can be 2 and 4 respectively, but we need to check the gcd condition. Given the gcd is 6, the smallest values for \(a\) and \(b\) must be such that their gcd is 6.
  5. **Verification**: By checking the smallest values that satisfy the conditions, we find that the smallest possible value of the lcm is indeed 108.

    -- Use the property that the product of the gcd and lcm of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves.

    -- If the lcm is less than 108, then the gcd must be greater than 6, which contradicts the given gcd of 6.
    have h₄' : a < 108 := by
      nlinarith [Nat.gcd_mul_lcm a b]
    have h₅ : b < 108 := by
      nlinarith [Nat.gcd_mul_lcm a b]
    -- Use interval_cases to check all possible values of a and b that satisfy the conditions.
    interval_cases a <;> interval_cases b <;> simp_all [Nat.gcd_mul_lcm]
  -- The result follows from the above calculation.
