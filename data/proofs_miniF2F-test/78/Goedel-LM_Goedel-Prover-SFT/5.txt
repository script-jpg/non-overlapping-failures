  Given positive integers \(a\) and \(b\) such that the units digit of \(a\) is 2, the units digit of \(b\) is 4, and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(a\) and \(b\) is 6, we need to find the smallest possible value of the least common multiple (lcm) of \(a\) and \(b\).
  First, we note that the units digit of \(a\) is 2, and the units digit of \(b\) is 4. This implies that the units digit of their gcd is 2 (since the gcd of 2 and 4 is 2). Given that the gcd of \(a\) and \(b\) is 6, we can use the relationship between the gcd and lcm of two numbers, which states that the product of the gcd and lcm of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves.
  Using the properties of gcd and lcm, we have:
  \[ \text{gcd}(a, b) \times \text{lcm}(a, b) = a \times b \]
  Given \(\text{gcd}(a, b) = 6\), we can solve for \(\text{lcm}(a, b)\) as follows:
  \[ 6 \times \text{lcm}(a, b) = a \times b \]
  Since \(a\) and \(b\) are positive integers, we can use the fact that the units digit of \(a\) is 2 and the units digit of \(b\) is 4 to determine the smallest possible value of \(\text{lcm}(a, b)\). By examining the smallest possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) that satisfy the given conditions, we find that the smallest value of \(\text{lcm}(a, b)\) is 108.
