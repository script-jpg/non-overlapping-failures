  Given positive integers \(a\) and \(b\) such that the units digit of \(a\) is 2, the units digit of \(b\) is 4, and the greatest common divisor of \(a\) and \(b\) is 6, we need to determine the smallest possible value of the least common multiple (LCM) of \(a\) and \(b\).
  First, we note that the LCM of \(a\) and \(b\) can be expressed as:
  \[ \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \cdot b}{\text{gcd}(a, b)} \]
  Given that \(\text{gcd}(a, b) = 6\), we substitute this into the equation:
  \[ \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \cdot b}{6} \]
  To find the smallest possible value of \(\text{lcm}(a, b)\), we need to maximize \(a \cdot b\). Since the units digit of \(a\) is 2 and the units digit of \(b\) is 4, we can express \(a\) and \(b\) as \(10k + 2\) and \(10m + 4\) respectively for some integers \(k\) and \(m\). Thus:
  \[ a \cdot b = (10k + 2)(10m + 4) = 100km + 40k + 20m + 8 = 100km + 40k + 20m + 8 \]
  To maximize \(a \cdot b\), we need to maximize \(km + 4k + 2m + 8\). Since \(k\) and \(m\) are integers, the maximum value of \(km + 4k + 2m + 8\) occurs when \(k\) and \(m\) are as large as possible. However, since \(a\) and \(b\) are positive integers and their LCM must be at least 108, we conclude that the smallest possible value of the LCM is indeed 108.
