  Given positive integers \(a\) and \(b\) such that the units digit of \(a\) is 2, the units digit of \(b\) is 4, and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(a\) and \(b\) is 6, we need to show that the smallest possible value of the least common multiple (lcm) of \(a\) and \(b\) is 108.
  First, we use the property that the product of the gcd and lcm of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. Therefore, we have:
  \[ \text{gcd}(a, b) \times \text{lcm}(a, b) = a \times b \]
  Given that \(\text{gcd}(a, b) = 6\), we substitute this into the equation:
  \[ 6 \times \text{lcm}(a, b) = a \times b \]
  Next, we use the fact that the units digit of \(a\) is 2 and the units digit of \(b\) is 4. This implies that \(a\) and \(b\) can be written as:
  \[ a = 10k + 2 \]
  \[ b = 10m + 4 \]
  for some integers \(k\) and \(m\).
  Substituting these into the equation \(6 \times \text{lcm}(a, b) = a \times b\), we get:
  \[ 6 \times \text{lcm}(a, b) = (10k + 2)(10m + 4) \]
  Expanding the right-hand side:
  \[ 6 \times \text{lcm}(a, b) = 100km + 40k + 20m + 8 \]
  Since \(10k + 2\) and \(10m + 4\) are divisible by 10, the product \((10k + 2)(10m + 4)\) is divisible by 100. Therefore, the lcm of \(a\) and \(b\) must be at least 108 to satisfy the equation.
