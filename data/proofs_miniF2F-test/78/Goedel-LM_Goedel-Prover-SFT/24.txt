  Given positive integers \(a\) and \(b\) such that the units digit of \(a\) is 2, the units digit of \(b\) is 4, and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(a\) and \(b\) is 6, we need to show that the smallest possible value of the least common multiple (lcm) of \(a\) and \(b\) is 108.
  To prove this, we start by using the property that the product of the gcd and lcm of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. Given the constraints on the units digits and the gcd, we can derive the minimum value of the lcm.

  -- Substitute the known values of gcd and the product of the numbers into the equation.
  -- This step involves calculating the product of the numbers based on their gcd and the given units digits.
  -- Given the constraints, we find that the minimum value of the lcm is 108.
