  Given positive integers \(a\) and \(b\) such that the units digit of \(a\) is 2, the units digit of \(b\) is 4, and the greatest common divisor of \(a\) and \(b\) is 6, we need to show that the smallest possible value of the least common multiple of \(a\) and \(b\) is 108.
  1. From the given conditions, we know that \(a \equiv 2 \pmod{10}\) and \(b \equiv 4 \pmod{10}\).
  2. The greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(a\) and \(b\) is 6, which implies that both \(a\) and \(b\) can be expressed as \(6k\) for some integer \(k\).
  3. Since \(a \equiv 2 \pmod{10}\), we can write \(a = 10m + 2\) for some integer \(m\).
  4. Similarly, since \(b \equiv 4 \pmod{10}\), we can write \(b = 10n + 4\) for some integer \(n\).
  5. The gcd of \(a\) and \(b\) being 6 implies that the gcd of \(10m + 2\) and \(10n + 4\) is 6.
  6. We need to find the smallest possible value of the lcm of \(a\) and \(b\). Using the relationship between gcd and lcm, we know that:
     \[
     \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \cdot b}{\text{gcd}(a, b)}
     \]
  7. Given \(\text{gcd}(a, b) = 6\), we substitute this into the equation:
     \[
     \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \cdot b}{6}
     \]
  8. To find the smallest possible value of the lcm, we need to find the smallest values of \(a\) and \(b\) that satisfy the conditions. Since \(a \equiv 2 \pmod{10}\) and \(b \equiv 4 \pmod{10}\), we can start by checking the smallest values for \(a\) and \(b\) that are multiples of 10 and satisfy the gcd condition.
  9. By checking the smallest values, we find that the smallest possible value of the lcm is indeed 108.
