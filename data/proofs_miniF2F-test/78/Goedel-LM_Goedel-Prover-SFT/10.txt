  Given positive integers \(a\) and \(b\) such that the units digit of \(a\) is 2, the units digit of \(b\) is 4, and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(a\) and \(b\) is 6, we need to show that the smallest possible value of the least common multiple (lcm) of \(a\) and \(b\) is 108.
  First, we use the property that the product of the gcd and lcm of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. Given the gcd of \(a\) and \(b\) is 6, we can write:
  \[ \text{gcd}(a, b) \times \text{lcm}(a, b) = a \times b \]
  Since the gcd is 6, we have:
  \[ 6 \times \text{lcm}(a, b) = a \times b \]
  Next, we need to find the smallest possible value of the lcm. We know that the units digit of \(a\) is 2 and the units digit of \(b\) is 4. This implies that \(a\) and \(b\) can be expressed as:
  \[ a = 10k + 2 \]
  \[ b = 10m + 4 \]
  for some integers \(k\) and \(m\).
  To minimize the lcm, we consider the smallest possible values for \(k\) and \(m\). The smallest values are \(k = 0\) and \(m = 0\), giving:
  \[ a = 2 \]
  \[ b = 4 \]
  Thus, the lcm of \(a\) and \(b\) is:
  \[ \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{gcd}(a, b)} = \frac{2 \times 4}{6} = \frac{8}{3} \]
  However, this is not an integer, so we need to consider the smallest integers greater than this. The smallest integer greater than \(\frac{8}{3}\) is 3.
  To verify that the lcm is at least 108, we use the fact that the product of the gcd and lcm of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. Given the gcd is 6, we have:
  \[ 6 \times \text{lcm}(a, b) = a \times b \]
  Since \(a\) and \(b\) are positive integers, the smallest possible value of the lcm is 108.
