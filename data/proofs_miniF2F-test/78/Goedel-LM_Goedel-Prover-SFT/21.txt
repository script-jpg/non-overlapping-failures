  Given positive integers \(a\) and \(b\) such that the units digit of \(a\) is 2, the units digit of \(b\) is 4, and the greatest common divisor of \(a\) and \(b\) is 6, we need to find the smallest possible value of the least common multiple (LCM) of \(a\) and \(b\).
  First, we note that the LCM of \(a\) and \(b\) can be calculated using the formula:
  \[ \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \cdot b}{\text{gcd}(a, b)} \]
  Given that \(\text{gcd}(a, b) = 6\), we substitute this into the formula:
  \[ \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \cdot b}{6} \]
  Next, we need to determine the smallest possible value of \(a \cdot b\). Since the units digit of \(a\) is 2 and the units digit of \(b\) is 4, we can express \(a\) and \(b\) as:
  \[ a = 10k + 2 \]
  \[ b = 10m + 4 \]
  for some integers \(k\) and \(m\). The product \(a \cdot b\) is:
  \[ a \cdot b = (10k + 2)(10m + 4) \]
  Expanding this product, we get:
  \[ a \cdot b = 100km + 40k + 20m + 8 \]
  Since the units digit of \(a \cdot b\) must be 2 (to maintain the units digit of 2 for \(a\) and 4 for \(b\)), we focus on the units digit:
  \[ 100km + 40k + 20m + 8 \equiv 2 \pmod{10} \]
  Simplifying, we find:
  \[ 100km + 40k + 20m + 8 \equiv 2 \pmod{10} \]
  \[ 100km + 40k + 20m \equiv -6 \pmod{10} \]
  \[ 100km + 40k + 20m \equiv 4 \pmod{10} \]
  Since \(100 \equiv 0 \pmod{10}\), \(40 \equiv 0 \pmod{10}\), and \(20 \equiv 0 \pmod{10}\), we have:
  \[ 0 \equiv 4 \pmod{10} \]
  This implies that the smallest possible value of \(a \cdot b\) that satisfies the units digit condition is 108.
  Thus, the smallest possible value of the LCM of \(a\) and \(b\) is:
  \[ \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{108}{6} = 18 \]
