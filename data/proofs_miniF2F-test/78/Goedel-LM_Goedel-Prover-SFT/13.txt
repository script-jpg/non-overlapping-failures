  Given positive integers \(a\) and \(b\) such that the units digit of \(a\) is 2, the units digit of \(b\) is 4, and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(a\) and \(b\) is 6, we need to find the smallest possible value of the least common multiple (lcm) of \(a\) and \(b\). We show that the smallest possible value is 108.
  First, we use the relationship between the gcd and lcm of two numbers, which states that the product of the two numbers is equal to the product of their gcd and lcm. Using this relationship, we can derive the lcm of \(a\) and \(b\).

  -- We know that the product of the gcd and lcm of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves.
  have h₄ : a * b = Nat.gcd a b * Nat.lcm a b := by simp
  -- Substitute the given values of gcd and the product of a and b into the equation.
  rw [h₃] at h₄
  -- Simplify the equation to find the lcm.
  norm_num at h₄
  -- Since a and b are positive integers and their gcd is 6, we can infer that their lcm must be at least 108.

  intro h
  -- If the lcm were less than 108, we would have a contradiction with the given conditions.
  have h₅ : a < 108 := by
    nlinarith
  have h₆ : b < 108 := by
    nlinarith
  -- Use interval_cases to check all possible values of a and b that satisfy the conditions.
  interval_cases a <;> interval_cases b <;> simp_all
