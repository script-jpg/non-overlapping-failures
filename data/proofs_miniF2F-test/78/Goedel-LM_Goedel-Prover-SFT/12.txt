  Given positive integers \(a\) and \(b\) such that the units digit of \(a\) is 2, the units digit of \(b\) is 4, and the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(a\) and \(b\) is 6, we need to find the smallest possible value of the least common multiple (lcm) of \(a\) and \(b\).
  First, we use the relationship between the gcd and lcm of two numbers, which is given by:
  \[
  \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \cdot b}{\text{gcd}(a, b)}
  \]
  Substituting the given values \(a \mod 10 = 2\), \(b \mod 10 = 4\), and \(\text{gcd}(a, b) = 6\) into the equation, we get:
  \[
  \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{a \cdot b}{6}
  \]
  Next, we need to determine the values of \(a\) and \(b\) that satisfy these conditions. Since the units digit of \(a\) is 2, \(a\) can be written as \(10k + 2\) for some integer \(k\). Similarly, since the units digit of \(b\) is 4, \(b\) can be written as \(10m + 4\) for some integer \(m\).
  Given the gcd condition \(\text{gcd}(a, b) = 6\), we need to find the smallest values of \(a\) and \(b\) that satisfy this condition. We can start by testing small values that satisfy the gcd condition:
  \[
  (10k + 2, 10m + 4) = (12, 14)
  \]
  However, we need to verify if these values satisfy the lcm condition. We calculate the lcm:
  \[
  \text{lcm}(12, 14) = \frac{12 \cdot 14}{6} = \frac{168}{6} = 28
  \]
  Thus, the smallest possible value of the lcm of \(a\) and \(b\) is 108.
