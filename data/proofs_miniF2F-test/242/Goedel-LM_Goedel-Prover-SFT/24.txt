  Given that \( n \) is a multiple of three, we need to determine the remainder when \( (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) \) is divided by 9. We will show that the remainder is 0.
  First, we simplify the expression \( (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) \):
  \[
  (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) = 3n + 18
  \]
  Next, we observe that \( 3n + 18 \) can be factored as:
  \[
  3n + 18 = 3(n + 6)
  \]
  Since \( n \) is a multiple of three, \( n = 3k \) for some integer \( k \). Substituting \( n = 3k \) into the expression \( 3(n + 6) \):
  \[
  3(n + 6) = 3(3k + 6) = 9k + 18
  \]
  The remainder when \( 9k + 18 \) is divided by 9 is the same as the remainder when 18 is divided by 9, which is 0. Therefore, the remainder when \( (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) \) is divided by 9 is 0.
