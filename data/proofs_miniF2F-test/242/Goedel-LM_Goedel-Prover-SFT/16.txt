  Given \( n \) is a multiple of three, we need to determine the remainder when \( (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) \) is divided by 9. We will show that this remainder is 0.
  First, we express the sum \( (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) \) in a simplified form:
  \[
  (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) = 3n + 18
  \]
  Next, we find the remainder of \( 3n + 18 \) when divided by 9:
  \[
  3n + 18 \equiv 0 \pmod{9}
  \]
  This is because:
  \[
  3n \equiv 0 \pmod{9} \quad \text{(since \( n \) is a multiple of 3)}
  \]
  \[
  18 \equiv 0 \pmod{9} \quad \text{(since 18 is a multiple of 9)}
  \]
  Thus, the remainder when \( 3n + 18 \) is divided by 9 is 0.
