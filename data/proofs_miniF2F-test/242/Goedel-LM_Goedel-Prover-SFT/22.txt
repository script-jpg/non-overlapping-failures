  Given \( n \) is a multiple of three, we need to show that the remainder when \( (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) \) is divided by 9 is 0. 
  First, we express \( n \) as \( 3k \) for some integer \( k \). Then, we substitute \( n = 3k \) into the expression \( (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) \). This gives us:
  \[
  (3k + 4) + (3k + 6) + (3k + 8)
  \]
  Simplifying this, we get:
  \[
  3k + 3k + 3k + 4 + 6 + 8 = 9k + 18
  \]
  Next, we find the remainder of \( 9k + 18 \) when divided by 9. Since \( 9k \) is a multiple of 9, it has a remainder of 0 when divided by 9. Therefore, the remainder of \( 9k + 18 \) is the same as the remainder of 18 when divided by 9. We calculate \( 18 \mod 9 \):
  \[
  18 \div 9 = 2 \text{ remainder } 0 \implies 18 \equiv 0 \mod 9
  \]
  Thus, the remainder when \( (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) \) is divided by 9 is 0.
