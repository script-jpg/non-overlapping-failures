  Given \( n \) is a multiple of three, we need to determine the remainder when \( (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) \) is divided by 9. We will show that this remainder is 0.
  First, we express the sum \( (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) \) in a simplified form:
  \[
  (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) = 3n + 18
  \]
  Next, we need to find the remainder of \( 3n + 18 \) when divided by 9. We can simplify this by noting that:
  \[
  3n + 18 = 3(n + 6)
  \]
  Since \( n \) is a multiple of three, \( n + 6 \) is also a multiple of three. Therefore, \( 3(n + 6) \) is a multiple of 9. Hence, the remainder when \( 3(n + 6) \) is divided by 9 is 0.
