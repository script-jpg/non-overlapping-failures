  Given that \( n \) is a multiple of three, we need to determine the remainder when the sum \((n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8)\) is divided by 9. We will show that this remainder is 0.
  First, we simplify the expression \((n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8)\):
  \[
  (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) = 3n + 18
  \]
  Next, we observe that \( 3n + 18 \) can be factored as:
  \[
  3n + 18 = 3(n + 6)
  \]
  Since \( n \) is a multiple of three, \( n + 6 \) is also a multiple of three. Therefore, \( 3(n + 6) \) is clearly divisible by 3. To find the remainder when \( 3(n + 6) \) is divided by 9, we note that:
  \[
  3(n + 6) = 3n + 18
  \]
  Since \( 3n + 18 \) is divisible by 9, the remainder when \( 3n + 18 \) is divided by 9 is 0.
