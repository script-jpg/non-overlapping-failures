  Given \( n \) is a multiple of three, we need to determine the remainder when \( (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) \) is divided by 9. We will show that this remainder is 0.
  First, we simplify the expression \( (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) \):
  \[
  (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) = 3n + 18
  \]
  Next, we need to find the remainder of \( 3n + 18 \) when divided by 9. We can simplify this expression modulo 9:
  \[
  3n + 18 \equiv 3n + 0 \pmod{9}
  \]
  Since \( 3n \equiv 0 \pmod{9} \) (because \( n \) is a multiple of 3), we have:
  \[
  3n + 0 \equiv 0 + 0 \equiv 0 \pmod{9}
  \]
  Thus, the remainder when \( 3n + 18 \) is divided by 9 is 0.
