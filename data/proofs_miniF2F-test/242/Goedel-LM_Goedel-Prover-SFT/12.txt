  Given that \( n \) is a multiple of three, we need to determine the remainder when the sum \( (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) \) is divided by 9. We will show that the remainder is 0.
  First, we simplify the expression:
  \[
  (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) = 3n + 18
  \]
  Next, we observe that \( 3n + 18 \) can be factored as:
  \[
  3n + 18 = 3(n + 6)
  \]
  Since \( n \) is a multiple of three, we can write \( n = 3k \) for some integer \( k \). Substituting \( n = 3k \) into the expression, we get:
  \[
  3(3k + 6) = 9k + 18
  \]
  We then find the remainder of \( 9k + 18 \) when divided by 9:
  \[
  9k + 18 \equiv 0 + 0 \equiv 0 \pmod{9}
  \]
  Thus, the remainder when \( (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) \) is divided by 9 is 0.
