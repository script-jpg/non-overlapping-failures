  Given \( n \) is a multiple of three, we need to determine the remainder when \( (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) \) is divided by 9. We will show that this remainder is 0.
  First, we express the sum \( (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) \) in a simplified form:
  \[
  (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) = 3n + 18
  \]
  Next, we observe that \( 3n + 18 \) can be factored as:
  \[
  3n + 18 = 3(n + 6)
  \]
  Since \( n \) is a multiple of three, \( n + 6 \) is an integer. We need to find the remainder of \( 3(n + 6) \) when divided by 9.
  We can rewrite \( 3(n + 6) \) as:
  \[
  3(n + 6) = 3n + 18
  \]
  Given that \( n \) is a multiple of three, we can express \( n \) as \( 3k \) for some integer \( k \). Substituting \( n = 3k \) into the expression, we get:
  \[
  3(n + 6) = 3(3k + 6) = 9k + 18
  \]
  We need to find the remainder of \( 9k + 18 \) when divided by 9. Since \( 9k \) is a multiple of 9, it has a remainder of 0 when divided by 9. Therefore, the remainder of \( 9k + 18 \) when divided by 9 is the same as the remainder of 18 when divided by 9, which is 0.
  Thus, we have shown that the remainder when \( (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) \) is divided by 9 is 0.
