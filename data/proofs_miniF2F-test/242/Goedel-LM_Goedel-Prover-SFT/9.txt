  Given that \( n \) is a multiple of three, we need to show that the remainder when \( (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) \) is divided by 9 is 0. 
  First, we simplify the expression \( (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) \):
  \[
  (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) = 3n + 18
  \]
  Next, we observe that \( 3n + 18 \) can be factored as:
  \[
  3n + 18 = 3(n + 6)
  \]
  Since \( 3(n + 6) \) is clearly a multiple of 3, it follows that \( 3(n + 6) \) is also a multiple of 9. Therefore, the remainder when \( 3(n + 6) \) is divided by 9 is 0.

  -- Use the fact that n is a multiple of 3 to show that 3n + 18 is a multiple of 9
  -- Since 3n + 18 is already a multiple of 3, it is also a multiple of 9, hence the remainder is 0
