  Given \( n \) is a multiple of three, we need to show that the remainder when \( (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) \) is divided by 9 is 0. 
  First, we simplify the expression \( (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) \):
  \[
  (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) = 3n + 18
  \]
  Next, we observe that \( 3n + 18 \) can be factored as:
  \[
  3n + 18 = 3(n + 6)
  \]
  Since \( 3(n + 6) \) is clearly divisible by 3, we need to check if \( 3(n + 6) \) is also divisible by 9. However, since \( n \) is a multiple of 3, \( n + 6 \) is still a multiple of 3, and thus \( 3(n + 6) \) is a multiple of 9.
  Therefore, \( 3(n + 6) \) is divisible by 9, and the remainder when \( 3(n + 6) \) is divided by 9 is 0.
