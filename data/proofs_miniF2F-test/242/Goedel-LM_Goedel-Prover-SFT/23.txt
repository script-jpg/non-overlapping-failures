  Given that \( n \) is a multiple of three, we need to determine the remainder when \( (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) \) is divided by 9. We start by simplifying the expression:
  \[
  (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) = 3n + 18
  \]
  Next, we need to find the remainder of \( 3n + 18 \) when divided by 9. We can simplify this by noting that \( 3n \) is a multiple of 3, and thus it is congruent to 0 modulo 9. Therefore, we only need to consider the remainder of 18 modulo 9, which is 0. Hence, the remainder of \( 3n + 18 \) when divided by 9 is 0.

  -- Since 3n is a multiple of 3, it is congruent to 0 modulo 9, and thus 3n + 18 is congruent to 18 modulo 9
  -- The remainder of 18 modulo 9 is 0, hence the remainder of 3n + 18 when divided by 9 is 0
