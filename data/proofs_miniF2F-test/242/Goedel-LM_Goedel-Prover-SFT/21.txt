  Given \( n \) is a multiple of three, we need to determine the remainder when \( (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) \) is divided by 9. We will show that this remainder is 0.
  First, we simplify the expression \( (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) \):
  \[
  (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) = 3n + 18
  \]
  Next, we observe that \( 3n + 18 \) is clearly divisible by 3. Since \( 3 \) divides \( 3n + 18 \), the remainder when \( 3n + 18 \) is divided by 3 is 0.
  To confirm, we can use the fact that \( 3n + 18 \) is a multiple of 3:
  \[
  3n + 18 = 3(n + 6)
  \]
  Thus, the remainder when \( 3n + 18 \) is divided by 9 is:
  \[
  3(n + 6) \mod 9 = 3 \cdot 0 \mod 9 = 0
  \]
  Therefore, the remainder when \( (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) \) is divided by 9 is 0.

  have h : (n + 4 + (n + 6) + (n + 8)) % 9 = 0 := by
    -- Simplify the expression to 3n + 18
    have : (n + 4 + (n + 6) + (n + 8)) % 9 = (3 * n + 18) % 9 := by
