  Given \( n \) is a multiple of three, we need to determine the remainder when \( (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) \) is divided by 9. We will show that this remainder is 0.
  First, we express \( n \) in the form \( n = 3k \) for some integer \( k \). Substituting \( n = 3k \) into the expression \( (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) \), we get:
  \[
  (3k + 4) + (3k + 6) + (3k + 8) = 9k + 18
  \]
  Next, we find the remainder of \( 9k + 18 \) when divided by 9:
  \[
  9k + 18 \equiv 0 + 18 \equiv 18 \equiv 0 \pmod{9}
  \]
  Thus, the remainder is 0, confirming that \( (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) \) is a multiple of 9.

  -- Simplify the expression modulo 9.
  -- The expression simplifies to 9k + 18, which is congruent to 0 modulo 9.
