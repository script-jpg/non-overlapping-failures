  Given that \( n \) is a multiple of three, we need to show that the remainder when \( (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) \) is divided by 9 is 0. First, we simplify the expression \( (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) \) to \( 3n + 18 \). Since \( n \) is a multiple of three, we can write \( n = 3k \) for some integer \( k \). Substituting \( n = 3k \) into the expression, we get \( 3(3k) + 18 = 9k + 18 \). We then find the remainder of \( 9k + 18 \) when divided by 9. Since \( 9k \) is a multiple of 9, it has a remainder of 0. Thus, the remainder of \( 9k + 18 \) is the same as the remainder of 18 when divided by 9, which is 0. Therefore, the remainder is 0.
