  Given \( n \) is a multiple of three, we need to show that the remainder when \( (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) \) is divided by 9 is 0. First, we express \( n \) as \( 3k \) for some integer \( k \). Then, we compute the sum \( (n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) \) and find its remainder modulo 9. By simplifying the expression, we find that it is congruent to 0 modulo 9, confirming the remainder is 0.

  -- We rewrite the expression to show that the sum modulo 9 is 0.

  -- Using the fact that n % 9 = 0 (since n is a multiple of 3), we simplify the expression modulo 9.
