The key insight in this problem is that when $n$ is a multiple of 3, we can express $n$ as $n = 3k$ for some integer $k$. Then, we can analyze the expression $(n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8)$ as follows:

1. Substitute $n = 3k$ into the expression:
   - $(3k + 4) + (3k + 6) + (3k + 8)$

2. Simplify the expression:
   - $3k + 4 + 3k + 6 + 3k + 8 = 9k + 18$

3. Notice that $9k + 18 = 9(k + 2)$, which is clearly divisible by 9.

4. Therefore, the remainder when $9(k + 2)$ is divided by 9 is 0.

This approach shows that the expression is always divisible by 9 when $n$ is a multiple of 3, so the remainder is 0.

The Lean proof follows this reasoning by:
- Using the hypothesis that $3 \mid n$ to express $n = 3k$ for some $k$ (though we don't need to explicitly introduce $k$)
- Rewriting the expression $n + 4 + (n + 6) + (n + 8)$ as $3n + 18$
- Factoring out 3 to get $3(n + 6)$
- Using the property that $3 \cdot m \bmod 9 = 3 \cdot (m \bmod 3)$
- Noting that $n + 6 \equiv n \pmod{3}$, and since $n \equiv 0 \pmod{3}$, we have $n + 6 \equiv 6 \pmod{9}$
- Therefore $3(n + 6) \equiv 3 \cdot 6 = 18 \equiv 0 \pmod{9}$

This completes the proof that the remainder is 0.
