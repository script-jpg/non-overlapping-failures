-- Show that if $n$ is a multiple of $3$, then $(n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8)$ is a multiple of $9$. We do this by simplifying the expression and finding the remainder.
  -- Expand the expression: $(n + 4) + (n + 6) + (n + 8) = n + 4 + n + 6 + n + 8 = 3n + 18$

  -- We need to show that $3n + 18$ is a multiple of $9$. Since $n$ is a multiple of $3$, we can write $n = 3k$ for some integer $k$.
  rcases h₁ with ⟨k, rfl⟩
  -- Substitute $n = 3k$ into $3n + 18$: $3(3k) + 18 = 9k + 18 = 9(k + 2)$
  have : 3 * (3 * k) + 18 = 9 * (k + 2) := by ring
  rw [this]
  -- Therefore, $3n + 18$ is indeed a multiple of $9$, and the remainder when divided by $9$ is $0$.
