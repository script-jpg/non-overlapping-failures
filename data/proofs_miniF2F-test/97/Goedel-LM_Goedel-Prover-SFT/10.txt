  Given \( n = 3^{17} + 3^{10} \), we know that 11 divides \( n + 1 \). If \( n \) can be written in base 10 as \( ABCACCBAB \), where \( A, B, C \) are distinct digits such that \( A \) and \( C \) are odd and \( B \) is not divisible by 3, we need to find \( 100A + 10B + C \) and show that it equals 129.

  -- We know that n is equal to 3^17 + 3^10 from the given hypothesis h₀.
  have : n = 3 ^ 17 + 3 ^ 10 := by simpa using h₀
  -- Simplify the list of digits and other hypotheses to find the exact values of A, B, and C.
