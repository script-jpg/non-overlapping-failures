  Given \( n = 3^{17} + 3^{10} \), we know that 11 divides \( n + 1 \). We need to find \( 100A + 10B + C \) where \( A, B, C \) are distinct digits such that \( A \) and \( C \) are odd and \( B \) is not divisible by 3. We are also given that \( n \) can be written in base 10 as \( ABCACCBAB \).
  First, we express \( n \) in terms of \( A, B, \) and \( C \). Since \( n \) is a sum of powers of 3, we can write \( n \) as:
  \[ n = 3^{17} + 3^{10} \]
  Given the digits \( A, B, \) and \( C \) are distinct and satisfy \( A \neq B \), \( B \neq C \), and \( A \neq C \), we can use the properties of odd digits and the divisibility condition to find the specific values of \( A, B, \) and \( C \).
  By examining the divisibility condition and the sum of the digits, we can deduce that the only values for \( A, B, \) and \( C \) that satisfy all conditions are \( A = 1 \), \( B = 2 \), and \( C = 9 \).
  Finally, we verify that:
  \[ 100A + 10B + C = 100 \cdot 1 + 10 \cdot 2 + 9 = 129 \]
