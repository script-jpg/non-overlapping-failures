  Given \( n = 3^{17} + 3^{10} \), we know that \( 11 \) divides \( n + 1 \). We need to find \( n \) in base \( 10 \) as \( ABCACCBAB \), where \( A, B, C \) are distinct digits such that \( A \) and \( C \) are odd and \( B \) is not divisible by \( 3 \). We aim to show that \( 100A + 10B + C = 129 \).

  -- We start by simplifying the given conditions and expressions.
  norm_num at h₀ h₁ h₂ h₃ h₄ h₅ h₆
  -- We use the fact that the digits of n in base 10 are given by the list [B, A, B, C, C, A, C, B, A].
  have := h₆
  -- We simplify the expression to isolate the digits.

    true_and_iff, and_true_iff, List.pairwise_cons]
  -- We use the fact that the digits are distinct and the constraints on their values.
  rcases h₅ with (h₅ | h₅ | h₅) <;> simp_all [Nat.odd_iff_not_even, Nat.even_iff]
  -- We use the omega tactic to solve the resulting linear equations.
