  Given \( n = 3^{17} + 3^{10} \), it is known that \( 11 \) divides \( n + 1 \). We need to find \( 100A + 10B + C \) where \( A, B, C \) are distinct digits such that \( A \) and \( C \) are odd and \( B \) is not divisible by \( 3 \). We are to show that this expression equals \( 129 \).

  -- Finally, we use linarith to conclude the proof.
