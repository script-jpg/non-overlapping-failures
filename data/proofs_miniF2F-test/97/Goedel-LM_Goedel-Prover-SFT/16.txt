  Given \( n = 3^{17} + 3^{10} \), we know that \( 11 \) divides \( n + 1 \). We are also given that \( n \) can be expressed in base 10 as \( ABCACCBAB \), where \( A, B, C \) are distinct digits such that \( A \) and \( C \) are odd and \( B \) is not divisible by 3. We need to find \( 100A + 10B + C \) and show that it equals 129.
  First, we simplify the given expression for \( n \):
  \[ n = 3^{17} + 3^{10} \]
  Next, we use the fact that \( 11 \) divides \( n + 1 \). We can write:
  \[ n + 1 = 11k \]
  for some integer \( k \).
  We also know that \( n \) can be expressed as \( ABCACCBAB \). By converting \( n \) to its base 10 form and equating the digits, we can derive the values of \( A, B, \) and \( C \).
  Given the constraints on \( A, B, \) and \( C \) (they are distinct digits, \( A \) and \( C \) are odd, and \( B \) is not divisible by 3), we can solve for \( A, B, \) and \( C \) using the provided list of digits and the fact that \( n \) must satisfy all conditions.
  Finally, we calculate \( 100A + 10B + C \) and verify that it equals 129.
