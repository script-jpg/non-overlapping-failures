  Given \( n = 3^{17} + 3^{10} \), it is known that 11 divides \( n + 1 \). If \( n \) can be written in base 10 as \( ABCACCBAB \), where \( A, B, C \) are distinct digits such that \( A \) and \( C \) are odd and \( B \) is not divisible by 3, we need to find \( 100A + 10B + C \) and show that it equals 129.
