  Given \( n = 3^{17} + 3^{10} \), it is known that 11 divides \( n + 1 \). We need to find \( 100A + 10B + C \) where \( A, B, C \) are distinct digits such that \( A \) and \( C \) are odd and \( B \) is not divisible by 3, and show that this equals 129.
  First, we express \( n \) in terms of its digits. The digits of \( n \) are given as \( [B, A, B, C, C, A, C, B, A] \). We know that the digits are distinct and satisfy the conditions \( A \) and \( C \) are odd and \( B \) is not divisible by 3.
  Given the constraints, we can deduce that the digits must be chosen such that the number \( 100A + 10B + C \) equals 129. This is achieved by solving the system of equations derived from the given conditions and the digits' properties.

  -- We start by simplifying the given conditions and using the properties of the digits.
  simp [Nat.digits_add, Nat.digits_one, Nat.add_assoc] at h₆
  -- We know that the digits are distinct and satisfy the conditions.
  have h₇ : A ≤ 9 := by simp_all
  have h₈ : B ≤ 9 := by simp_all
  have h₉ : C ≤ 9 := by simp_all
  -- We use interval_cases to check all possible values for A, B, and C.
  interval_cases A <;> interval_cases B <;> interval_cases C <;> simp_all (config := {decide := true})
