  Given \( n = 3^{17} + 3^{10} \), we know that 11 divides \( n + 1 \). We need to find \( n \) in base 10, which is represented as \( ABCACCBAB \), where \( A, B, C \) are distinct digits such that \( A \) and \( C \) are odd and \( B \) is not divisible by 3. We aim to show that \( 100A + 10B + C = 129 \).
