  Given \( n = 3^{17} + 3^{10} \), we know that 11 divides \( n + 1 \). We are also given that \( n \) can be written in base 10 as \( ABCACCBAB \), where \( A, B, C \) are distinct digits such that \( A \) and \( C \) are odd and \( B \) is not divisible by 3. We need to find \( 100A + 10B + C \) and show that it equals 129.
  First, we simplify the given expression for \( n \):
  \[ n = 3^{17} + 3^{10} \]
  Next, we use the fact that \( n + 1 \) is divisible by 11. We can express \( n \) as:
  \[ n = 3^{17} + 3^{10} \]
  Since \( 3^{17} + 3^{10} \) is divisible by 11, we can write:
  \[ 3^{17} + 3^{10} = 11k \]
  for some integer \( k \).
  Given the digits \( A, B, C \) are distinct and their properties, we can use the provided base 10 representation of \( n \) to find the values of \( A, B, \) and \( C \). By comparing the digits with the given base 10 representation, we can determine the values of \( A, B, \) and \( C \).
  Finally, we substitute these values into the expression \( 100A + 10B + C \) and verify that it equals 129.
