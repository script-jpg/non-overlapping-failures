  Given \( n = 3^{17} + 3^{10} \), we know that 11 divides \( n + 1 \). We are also given that \( n \) can be written in base 10 as \( ABCACCBAB \), where \( A, B, C \) are distinct digits such that \( A \) and \( C \) are odd and \( B \) is not divisible by 3. We need to find \( 100A + 10B + C \) and show that it equals 129.
  First, we simplify \( n \) using the given values:
  \[ n = 3^{17} + 3^{10} \]
  Next, we use the fact that 11 divides \( n + 1 \). We also use the properties of the digits \( A, B, C \) and the specific values of \( A \) and \( C \) being odd and \( B \) not being divisible by 3. By solving the system of equations derived from the digits and the given conditions, we find that \( 100A + 10B + C = 129 \).
