  To compute \(29^{13} - 5^{13}\) modulo 7 and show that it is 3, we start by reducing the bases modulo 7. We find that \(29 \equiv 5 \pmod{7}\) and \(5 \equiv 5 \pmod{7}\). Thus, the expression simplifies to \(5^{13} - 5^{13} \pmod{7}\). Since \(5 \equiv 5 \pmod{7}\), we can simplify the expression further to \(5^{13} - 5^{13} \equiv 0 \pmod{7}\). However, this is incorrect as it does not match the given result. Instead, we should directly compute the values modulo 7 and verify the result.
