  To compute \(29^{13} - 5^{13}\) modulo 7, we can simplify the problem by reducing the bases modulo 7. First, we find the remainders of 29 and 5 when divided by 7:
  \[ 29 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
  \[ 5 \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \]
  Next, we compute the powers of these reduced bases modulo 7:
  \[ 29^{13} \equiv 1^{13} \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
  \[ 5^{13} \equiv 5^{13} \pmod{7} \]
  Now, we need to compute \(5^{13} \mod 7\). We observe that the powers of 5 modulo 7 cycle every 3 steps:
  \[ 5^1 \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \]
  \[ 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \]
  \[ 5^3 \equiv 125 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \]
  \[ 5^4 \equiv 625 \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \]
  \[ 5^5 \equiv 3125 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \]
  Since \(5^5 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}\), and 13 is a multiple of 5, we can simplify \(5^{13}\) as:
  \[ 5^{13} \equiv 5^{5 \cdot 2 + 3} \equiv (5^5)^2 \cdot 5^3 \equiv 3^2 \cdot 6 \equiv 9 \cdot 6 \equiv 54 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
  Thus, we have:
  \[ 29^{13} - 5^{13} \equiv 1 - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
  However, this result does not match the expected value of 3. This suggests a potential error in the initial assumptions or calculations. Given the provided Lean4 code, it seems there might be a simplification or correction needed.
