  To compute \(29^{13} - 5^{13}\) modulo 7, we can simplify the problem by reducing the numbers modulo 7. We start by finding the remainders of 29 and 5 when divided by 7:
  \[ 29 \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \]
  \[ 5 \equiv 5 \pmod{7} \]
  Thus, we have:
  \[ 29^{13} \equiv 5^{13} \pmod{7} \]
  Therefore, the expression \(29^{13} - 5^{13}\) modulo 7 simplifies to:
  \[ 29^{13} - 5^{13} \equiv 5^{13} - 5^{13} \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \]
  However, the problem states that the result should be 3. This suggests a mistake in the initial reduction or interpretation. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

  -- Reduce the numbers modulo 7
  norm_num [pow_mod, (by decide : 29 % 7 = 5), (by decide : 5 % 7 = 5)]
  -- The above line simplifies the powers modulo 7
  -- 29 ≡ 5 (mod 7), so 29^13 ≡ 5^13 (mod 7)
  -- Thus, 29^13 - 5^13 ≡ 5^13 - 5^13 ≡ 0 (mod 7)
  -- However, the problem states the result should be 3, which suggests a mistake in the initial reduction or interpretation.
  -- Let's re-evaluate the problem.
