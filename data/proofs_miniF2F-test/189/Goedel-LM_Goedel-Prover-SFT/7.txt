  To solve the equation \(|2 - x| = 3\), we need to consider the two cases for the absolute value:
  1. \(2 - x = 3\)
  2. \(2 - x = -3\)
  For the first case, solving \(2 - x = 3\) gives:
  \[ x = 2 - 3 = -1 \]
  For the second case, solving \(2 - x = -3\) gives:
  \[ x = 2 + 3 = 5 \]
  Thus, the solutions to the equation \(|2 - x| = 3\) are \(x = -1\) and \(x = 5\). We need to find the sum of these solutions:
  \[ -1 + 5 = 4 \]
  Therefore, the sum of all solutions is 4.
