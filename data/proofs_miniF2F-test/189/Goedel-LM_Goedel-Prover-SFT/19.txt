  To find the sum of all solutions of the equation \( |2 - x| = 3 \), we start by analyzing the given equation. The absolute value equation \( |2 - x| = 3 \) can be split into two separate equations:
  \[ 2 - x = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad 2 - x = -3 \]
  Solving these equations, we get:
  \[ x = 2 - 3 = -1 \]
  \[ x = 2 + 3 = 5 \]
  Thus, the solutions to the equation are \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 5 \). We need to show that the sum of these solutions is 4. The sum of the solutions is:
  \[ -1 + 5 = 4 \]
  Therefore, the sum of all solutions of the equation \( |2 - x| = 3 \) is indeed 4.

  -- We need to show that the sum of all solutions of the equation |2 - x| = 3 is 4.
  -- The equation |2 - x| = 3 can be split into two cases: 2 - x = 3 and 2 - x = -3.
  -- Solving these, we get x = -1 and x = 5.
  -- The sum of these solutions is -1 + 5 = 4.
