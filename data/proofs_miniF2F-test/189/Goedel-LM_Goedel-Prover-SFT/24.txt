  To find the sum of all solutions of the equation \( |2 - x| = 3 \), we first identify the solutions. The equation \( |2 - x| = 3 \) implies that \( 2 - x \) must be either 3 or -3, as the absolute value of a number is 3 if and only if the number itself is 3 or -3. Therefore, we solve the following two cases:
  1. \( 2 - x = 3 \)
  2. \( 2 - x = -3 \)
  Solving these equations separately:
  1. For \( 2 - x = 3 \):
     \[
     x = 2 - 3 = -1
     \]
  2. For \( 2 - x = -3 \):
     \[
     x = 2 + 3 = 5
     \]
  Thus, the solutions to the equation \( |2 - x| = 3 \) are \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 5 \). The sum of these solutions is:
  \[
  -1 + 5 = 4
  \]
