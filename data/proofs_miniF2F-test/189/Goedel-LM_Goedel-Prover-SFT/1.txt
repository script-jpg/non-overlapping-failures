  To solve the equation \(|2 - x| = 3\), we consider the cases where \(2 - x\) is either non-negative or negative. In the first case, \(|2 - x| = 2 - x = 3\), giving us \(x = 2 - 3 = -1\). In the second case, \(|2 - x| = -(2 - x) = 3\), giving us \(x = 2 + 3 = 5\). The solutions to the equation are \(x = -1\) and \(x = 5\). The sum of these solutions is \(-1 + 5 = 4\).
