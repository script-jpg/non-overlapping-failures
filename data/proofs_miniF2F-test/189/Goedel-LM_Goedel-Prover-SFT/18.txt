  To find the sum of all solutions of the equation \(|2 - x| = 3\), we start by identifying the solutions. The equation \(|2 - x| = 3\) can be split into two cases: \(2 - x = 3\) or \(2 - x = -3\). Solving these equations, we get:
  1. \(2 - x = 3\) implies \(x = -1\)
  2. \(2 - x = -3\) implies \(x = 5\)
  Thus, the solutions to the equation are \(x = -1\) and \(x = 5\). The sum of these solutions is:
  \[
  -1 + 5 = 4
  \]
  Therefore, the sum of all solutions of the equation \(|2 - x| = 3\) is indeed 4.
