  To find the sum of all solutions of the equation \( |2 - x| = 3 \), we first identify all the solutions by solving the equation. The equation \( |2 - x| = 3 \) implies that \( 2 - x \) can be either 3 or -3. Solving these equations, we get:
  \[ 2 - x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad 2 - x = -3 \]
  Solving these, we find:
  \[ x = 2 - 3 = -1 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 2 + 3 = 5 \]
  Thus, the solutions are \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 5 \). We then sum these solutions:
  \[ -1 + 5 = 4 \]
  Therefore, the sum of all solutions is 4.
