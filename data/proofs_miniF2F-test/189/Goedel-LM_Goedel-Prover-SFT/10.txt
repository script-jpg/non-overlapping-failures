  To find the sum of all solutions of the equation \(|2 - x| = 3\), we need to determine the values of \(x\) that satisfy this equation. The absolute value equation splits into two cases: \(2 - x = 3\) and \(2 - x = -3\). Solving these equations separately, we get:
  1. \(2 - x = 3\)
     \[
     -x = 1 \implies x = -1
     \]
  2. \(2 - x = -3\)
     \[
     -x = -5 \implies x = 5
     \]
  Thus, the solutions to the equation \(|2 - x| = 3\) are \(x = -1\) and \(x = 5\). The sum of these solutions is:
  \[
  -1 + 5 = 4
  \]
