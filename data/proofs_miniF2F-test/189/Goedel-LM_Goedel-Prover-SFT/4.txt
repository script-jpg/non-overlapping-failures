  To solve the equation \(|2 - x| = 3\), we need to consider the absolute value equation and find the values of \(x\) that satisfy it. The absolute value equation splits into two cases:
  \[ 2 - x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad 2 - x = -3 \]
  Solving these equations separately:
  1. \(2 - x = 3\)
  \[ -x = 1 \]
  \[ x = -1 \]
  2. \(2 - x = -3\)
  \[ -x = -5 \]
  \[ x = 5 \]
  Thus, the solutions to the equation \(|2 - x| = 3\) are \(x = -1\) and \(x = 5\). The sum of these solutions is:
  \[ -1 + 5 = 4 \]
