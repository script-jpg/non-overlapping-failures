  To find the sum of all solutions of the equation \( |2 - x| = 3 \), we start by identifying the solutions. The absolute value equation \( |2 - x| = 3 \) implies that \( 2 - x \) can be either 3 or -3. Solving these equations, we get:
  \[
  2 - x = 3 \implies x = 2 - 3 \implies x = -1
  \]
  \[
  2 - x = -3 \implies x = 2 + 3 \implies x = 5
  \]
  Thus, the solutions to the equation \( |2 - x| = 3 \) are \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 5 \). The sum of these solutions is:
  \[
  -1 + 5 = 4
  \]
