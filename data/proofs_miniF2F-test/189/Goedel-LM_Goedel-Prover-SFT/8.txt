  To find the sum of all solutions of the equation \(|2 - x| = 3\), we need to determine the values of \(x\) that satisfy this equation. The absolute value equation \(|2 - x| = 3\) can be split into two separate equations:
  \[ 2 - x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad 2 - x = -3 \]
  Solving these equations, we get:
  \[ 2 - x = 3 \implies x = -1 \]
  \[ 2 - x = -3 \implies x = 5 \]
  Thus, the solutions to the equation \(|2 - x| = 3\) are \(x = -1\) and \(x = 5\). The sum of these solutions is:
  \[ -1 + 5 = 4 \]
  Therefore, the sum of all solutions of the equation \(|2 - x| = 3\) is 4.
