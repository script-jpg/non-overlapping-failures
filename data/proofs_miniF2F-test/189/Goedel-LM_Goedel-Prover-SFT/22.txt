  To find the sum of all solutions of the equation \( |2 - x| = 3 \), we first identify the solutions by solving the equation. The absolute value equation \( |2 - x| = 3 \) can be split into two separate equations:
  \[ 2 - x = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad 2 - x = -3 \]
  Solving these equations, we get:
  \[ x = 2 - 3 = -1 \]
  \[ x = 2 + 3 = 5 \]
  Thus, the solutions to the equation \( |2 - x| = 3 \) are \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 5 \). The sum of these solutions is:
  \[ -1 + 5 = 4 \]
