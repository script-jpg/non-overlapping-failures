  To solve the equation \( |2 - x| = 3 \) and find the sum of all solutions, we consider the two cases for the absolute value:
  1. \( 2 - x = 3 \)
  2. \( 2 - x = -3 \)
  For the first case, we solve for \( x \):
  \[ 2 - x = 3 \implies x = 2 - 3 \implies x = -1 \]
  For the second case, we solve for \( x \):
  \[ 2 - x = -3 \implies x = 2 + 3 \implies x = 5 \]
  Thus, the solutions are \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 5 \). The sum of these solutions is:
  \[ -1 + 5 = 4 \]
