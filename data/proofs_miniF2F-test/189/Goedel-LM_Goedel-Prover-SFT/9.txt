  To solve the equation \(|2 - x| = 3\), we consider the cases where \(2 - x\) is non-negative or non-positive. In the first case, \(|2 - x| = 2 - x\). Setting this equal to 3, we get \(2 - x = 3\), which simplifies to \(x = -1\). In the second case, \(|2 - x| = -(2 - x) = x - 2\). Setting this equal to 3, we get \(x - 2 = 3\), which simplifies to \(x = 5\). Thus, the solutions to the equation \(|2 - x| = 3\) are \(x = -1\) and \(x = 5\). The sum of these solutions is \(-1 + 5 = 4\).
