  To solve the equation \( |2 - x| = 3 \), we need to consider the two cases for the absolute value:
  1. \( 2 - x = 3 \)
  2. \( 2 - x = -3 \)
  For the first case, solving \( 2 - x = 3 \) gives:
  \[ x = 2 - 3 = -1 \]
  For the second case, solving \( 2 - x = -3 \) gives:
  \[ x = 2 + 3 = 5 \]
  Thus, the solutions to the equation \( |2 - x| = 3 \) are \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 5 \). The sum of these solutions is:
  \[ -1 + 5 = 4 \]
