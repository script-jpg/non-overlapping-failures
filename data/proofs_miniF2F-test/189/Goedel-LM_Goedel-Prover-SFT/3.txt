  To solve the equation \(|2 - x| = 3\), we need to find the values of \(x\) that satisfy this equation. The absolute value equation splits into two cases:
  1. \(2 - x = 3\)
  2. \(2 - x = -3\)
  Solving these equations separately:
  1. For \(2 - x = 3\):
     \[
     x = 2 - 3 = -1
     \]
  2. For \(2 - x = -3\):
     \[
     x = 2 - (-3) = 2 + 3 = 5
     \]
  Thus, the solutions to the equation \(|2 - x| = 3\) are \(x = -1\) and \(x = 5\). The sum of these solutions is:
  \[
  -1 + 5 = 4
  \]
