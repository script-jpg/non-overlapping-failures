  To solve the equation \(|2 - x| = 3\) and find the sum of all solutions, we proceed as follows:
  1. **Identify the solutions**: The equation \(|2 - x| = 3\) implies that \(2 - x = 3\) or \(2 - x = -3\). Solving these equations, we get:
     \[
     2 - x = 3 \implies x = -1
     \]
     \[
     2 - x = -3 \implies x = 5
     \]
     Thus, the solutions are \(x = -1\) and \(x = 5\).
  2. **Sum the solutions**: Adding the solutions \(-1\) and \(5\), we obtain:
     \[
     -1 + 5 = 4
     \]
