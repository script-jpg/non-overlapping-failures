  To solve the equation \( |2 - x| = 3 \), we need to consider the two cases for the absolute value:
  1. \( 2 - x = 3 \)
  2. \( 2 - x = -3 \)
  From the first case, we get \( x = -1 \). From the second case, we get \( x = 5 \). Therefore, the solutions to the equation \( |2 - x| = 3 \) are \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 5 \).
  Next, we need to find the sum of these solutions:
  \[
  -1 + 5 = 4
  \]
  Thus, the sum of all solutions of the equation \( |2 - x| = 3 \) is 4.
