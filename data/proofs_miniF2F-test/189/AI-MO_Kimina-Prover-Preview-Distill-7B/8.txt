-- First, let's understand what we're trying to prove.
  -- We have an equation |2 - x| = 3, and we need to find the sum of all solutions.

  -- Let's start by analyzing the equation |2 - x| = 3.
  -- The absolute value equation |A| = B means either A = B or A = -B.
  -- So |2 - x| = 3 means either 2 - x = 3 or 2 - x = -3.

  -- We've determined that the set of solutions S = {-1, 5}.
  -- Now we just need to compute the sum of elements in S.
  -- The sum of -1 and 5 is 4.

  -- And that completes our proof! The sum of all solutions of the equation |2 - x| = 3 is indeed 4.
