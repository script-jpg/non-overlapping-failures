  To find the sum of all solutions of the equation \( |2 - x| = 3 \), we first solve the equation for \( x \).
  
  1. Consider the equation \( |2 - x| = 3 \).
  2. This means \( 2 - x = 3 \) or \( 2 - x = -3 \).
  3. Solving these, we get:
     - \( 2 - x = 3 \implies x = 2 - 3 = -1 \).
     - \( 2 - x = -3 \implies x = 2 + 3 = 5 \).
  4. Thus, the solutions are \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 5 \).
  5. The sum of the solutions is \( -1 + 5 = 4 \).
  
  We can verify this by checking the solutions in the original equation:
  - For \( x = -1 \): \( |2 - (-1)| = |3| = 3 \).
  - For \( x = 5 \): \( |2 - 5| = |-3| = 3 \).
  
  Both solutions satisfy the equation, so the sum of the solutions is indeed 4.
