  To solve the equation \(|2 - x| = 3\), we consider the two cases based on the definition of absolute value.
  
  1. **Case 1: \(2 - x \geq 0\)**
     \[
     |2 - x| = 2 - x
     \]
     Given \(|2 - x| = 3\), we have:
     \[
     2 - x = 3
     \]
     Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     x = 2 - 3 = -1
     \]
  
  2. **Case 2: \(2 - x < 0\)**
     \[
     |2 - x| = -(2 - x) = x - 2
     \]
     Given \(|2 - x| = 3\), we have:
     \[
     x - 2 = 3
     \]
     Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     x = 3 + 2 = 5
     \]
  
  Thus, the solutions to the equation \(|2 - x| = 3\) are \(x = -1\) and \(x = 5\). The sum of these solutions is:
  \[
  -1 + 5 = 4
  \]
