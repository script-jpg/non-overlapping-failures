  Given the equation \( |2 - x| = 3 \), we solve for \( x \) by considering the definition of absolute value. The equation \( |2 - x| = 3 \) implies that \( 2 - x = 3 \) or \( 2 - x = -3 \).
  
  1. For \( 2 - x = 3 \):
     \[
     2 - x = 3 \implies -x = 1 \implies x = -1
     \]
  
  2. For \( 2 - x = -3 \):
     \[
     2 - x = -3 \implies -x = -5 \implies x = 5
     \]
  
  Thus, the solutions to the equation are \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 5 \). The sum of these solutions is:
  \[
  -1 + 5 = 4
  \]
