  To find the sum of all solutions of the equation \( |2 - x| = 3 \), we first solve the equation for \( x \).
  
  Given:
  \[ |2 - x| = 3 \]
  
  We consider two cases based on the definition of absolute value:
  1. \( 2 - x \geq 0 \) (which implies \( x \leq 2 \))
  2. \( 2 - x < 0 \) (which implies \( x > 2 \))
  
  **Case 1: \( 2 - x \geq 0 \) (\( x \leq 2 \))**
  \[ |2 - x| = 2 - x \]
  Thus, the equation becomes:
  \[ 2 - x = 3 \]
  Solving for \( x \):
  \[ 2 - x = 3 \]
  \[ -x = 1 \]
  \[ x = -1 \]
  
  This solution is valid since \( -1 \leq 2 \).
  
  **Case 2: \( 2 - x < 0 \) (\( x > 2 \))**
  \[ |2 - x| = x - 2 \]
  Thus, the equation becomes:
  \[ x - 2 = 3 \]
  Solving for \( x \):
  \[ x - 2 = 3 \]
  \[ x = 5 \]
  
  This solution is valid since \( 5 > 2 \).
  
  We now have two solutions: \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 5 \).
  
  Next, we find the sum of these solutions:
  \[ -1 + 5 = 4 \]
  
  Thus, the sum of all solutions of the equation \( |2 - x| = 3 \) is \( \boxed{4} \).
