  To find the sum of all solutions of the equation \(|2 - x| = 3\), we first need to find all real numbers \(x\) that satisfy this equation. The equation \(|2 - x| = 3\) can be rewritten as two separate equations:
  
  1. \(2 - x = 3\)
  2. \(2 - x = -3\)
  
  Solving these equations:
  
  1. For \(2 - x = 3\):
     \[
     2 - x = 3 \implies -x = 1 \implies x = -1
     \]
  
  2. For \(2 - x = -3\):
     \[
     2 - x = -3 \implies -x = -5 \implies x = 5
     \]
  
  Thus, the solutions to the equation are \(x = -1\) and \(x = 5\). The sum of these solutions is:
  \[
  -1 + 5 = 4
  \]
  
  Therefore, the sum of all solutions to the equation \(|2 - x| = 3\) is \(\boxed{4}\).
