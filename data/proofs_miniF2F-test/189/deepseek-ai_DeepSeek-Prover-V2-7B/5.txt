  To find the sum of all solutions of the equation \(|2 - x| = 3\), we first need to find all real numbers \(x\) that satisfy this equation. The equation \(|2 - x| = 3\) means that the distance between \(x\) and 2 on the real number line is 3.
  
  We consider two cases based on the definition of absolute value:
  
  1. \(2 - x \geq 0\): In this case, \(|2 - x| = 2 - x\).
     The equation becomes \(2 - x = 3\).
     Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     2 - x = 3 \implies -x = 1 \implies x = -1
     \]
  
  2. \(2 - x < 0\): In this case, \(|2 - x| = -(2 - x) = x - 2\).
     The equation becomes \(x - 2 = 3\).
     Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     x - 2 = 3 \implies x = 5
     \]
  
  Thus, the solutions to the equation \(|2 - x| = 3\) are \(x = -1\) and \(x = 5\).
  
  To find the sum of these solutions, we add them together:
  \[
  -1 + 5 = 4
  \]
  
  Therefore, the sum of all solutions to the equation \(|2 - x| = 3\) is \(\boxed{4}\).
