  To solve the equation |2 - x| = 3, we consider two cases based on the value of x: one where 2 - x is non-negative, and another where it is negative.
  
  1. **Case 1: 2 - x ≥ 0 (x ≤ 2)**
     - The absolute value simplifies to 2 - x.
     - The equation becomes 2 - x = 3.
     - Solving for x:
       \[
       2 - x = 3 \implies -x = 1 \implies x = -1
       \]
     - Check the condition: x = -1 satisfies x ≤ 2.
  
  2. **Case 2: 2 - x < 0 (x > 2)**
     - The absolute value simplifies to x - 2.
     - The equation becomes x - 2 = 3.
     - Solving for x:
       \[
       x - 2 = 3 \implies x = 5
       \]
     - Check the condition: x = 5 satisfies x > 2.
  
  Thus, the solutions to the equation are x = -1 and x = 5. The sum of these solutions is:
  \[
  -1 + 5 = 4
  \]
