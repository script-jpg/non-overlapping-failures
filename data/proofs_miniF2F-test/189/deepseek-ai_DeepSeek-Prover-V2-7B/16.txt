  To solve the equation \( |2 - x| = 3 \), we consider the definition of absolute value. The absolute value of a number \( a \) is defined as the distance from \( a \) to 0 on the real number line, which is always non-negative. Therefore, the equation \( |2 - x| = 3 \) implies that the distance between \( x \) and 2 is 3 units.
  
  In other words, \( x \) must be 3 units away from 2. This gives us two possible values for \( x \):
  
  1. \( x = 2 + 3 = 5 \) (which is 3 units to the right of 2)
  2. \( x = 2 - 3 = -1 \) (which is 3 units to the left of 2)
  
  We need to find the sum of all solutions, so we add these two values together:
  
  \( 5 + (-1) = 4 \)
  
  Thus, the sum of all solutions to the equation \( |2 - x| = 3 \) is \( \boxed{4} \).
