  To find the sum of all solutions of the equation \( |2 - x| = 3 \), we first solve the equation for \( x \). The equation \( |2 - x| = 3 \) implies that \( 2 - x = 3 \) or \( 2 - x = -3 \).
  
  1. Solve \( 2 - x = 3 \):
     \[
     2 - x = 3 \implies -x = 1 \implies x = -1
     \]
  
  2. Solve \( 2 - x = -3 \):
     \[
     2 - x = -3 \implies -x = -5 \implies x = 5
     \]
  
  Thus, the solutions to the equation \( |2 - x| = 3 \) are \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 5 \). The sum of these solutions is:
  \[
  -1 + 5 = 4
  \]
  
  We can verify this by checking that both \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 5 \) satisfy the original equation. For \( x = -1 \):
  \[
  |2 - (-1)| = |2 + 1| = |3| = 3
  \]
  For \( x = 5 \):
  \[
  |2 - 5| = |-3| = 3
  \]
  Both solutions are correct, and their sum is indeed 4.
