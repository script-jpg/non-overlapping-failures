  To find the sum of all solutions of the equation \( |2 - x| = 3 \), we first find the solutions themselves. The equation \( |2 - x| = 3 \) can be rewritten as \( 2 - x = 3 \) or \( 2 - x = -3 \). Solving these equations gives us the solutions \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 5 \). The sum of these solutions is \( -1 + 5 = 4 \).
