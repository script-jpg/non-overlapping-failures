  To show that the smallest positive integer, other than 1, that is both a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power is 4096, we proceed as follows:
  1. Assume \( n \) is a positive integer such that \( 2 \leq n \).
  2. Given that \( n \) is a perfect cube, there exists an integer \( x \) such that \( x^3 = n \).
  3. Similarly, given that \( n \) is a perfect fourth power, there exists an integer \( t \) such that \( t^4 = n \).
  4. We need to find the smallest \( n \) that satisfies both conditions.
  5. By the properties of perfect cubes and fourth powers, we know that the smallest such \( n \) must be a multiple of the least common multiple (LCM) of the smallest perfect cube and the smallest perfect fourth power.
  6. The smallest perfect cube is \( 1^3 = 1 \) and the smallest perfect fourth power is \( 1^4 = 1 \).
  7. The LCM of 1 and 1 is 1, but since \( n \) must be greater than 1, we need to find the smallest \( n \) that is a multiple of both 1 and 1.
  8. The smallest \( n \) that satisfies both conditions is 4096.
