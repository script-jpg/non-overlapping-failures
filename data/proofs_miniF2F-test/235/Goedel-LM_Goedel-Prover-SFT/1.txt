  To show that the smallest positive integer \( n \) that is both a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power is 4096, we proceed as follows:
  1. **Identify the smallest possible value of \( n \)**:
     - Since \( n \) is a perfect cube, we can write \( n = x^3 \) for some integer \( x \).
     - Since \( n \) is also a perfect fourth power, we can write \( n = t^4 \) for some integer \( t \).
  2. **Find the smallest \( n \) that satisfies both conditions**:
     - We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( n = x^3 \) and \( n = t^4 \).
     - This implies \( x^3 = t^4 \).
  3. **Analyze the prime factorization**:
     - The smallest \( n \) that is a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power must be a multiple of both \( 3 \) and \( 4 \).
     - The smallest such \( n \) is \( 2^3 \times 3^3 = 8 \times 27 = 216 \).
  4. **Verify the smallest \( n \)**:
     - We need to check if there is a smaller \( n \) that satisfies both conditions.
     - By checking the smallest possible values, we find that \( 4^3 = 64 \) and \( 4^4 = 256 \), which is the smallest \( n \) that is a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power.
  5. **Conclusion**:
     - The smallest positive integer \( n \) that is both a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power is indeed 4096.
