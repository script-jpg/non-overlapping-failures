  To show that the smallest positive integer, other than 1, that is both a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power is 4096, we proceed as follows:
  1. Let \( n \) be a positive integer greater than or equal to 2.
  2. Given that \( n \) is a perfect cube, there exists an integer \( x \) such that \( x^3 = n \).
  3. Similarly, given that \( n \) is a perfect fourth power, there exists an integer \( t \) such that \( t^4 = n \).
  4. We need to find the smallest \( n \) that satisfies both conditions.
  5. By the properties of perfect cubes and perfect fourth powers, we know that \( n \) must be a common multiple of both 3 and 4.
  6. The least common multiple of 3 and 4 is 12.
  7. The smallest positive integer greater than or equal to 2 that is a multiple of 12 is 4096.
  8. Therefore, \( n \) must be at least 4096.
