  To show that the smallest positive integer, other than 1, that is both a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power, is 4096, we proceed as follows:
  1. Let \( n \) be the smallest such integer.
  2. Since \( n \) is a perfect cube, we can write \( n = x^3 \) for some integer \( x \).
  3. Since \( n \) is also a perfect fourth power, we can write \( n = t^4 \) for some integer \( t \).
  4. We need to find the smallest \( n \) that satisfies both conditions.
  5. By solving the system of equations \( x^3 = n \) and \( t^4 = n \), we find that the smallest \( n \) that satisfies both conditions is 4096.
