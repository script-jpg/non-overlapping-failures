  To show that the smallest positive integer \( n \) that is both a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power is 4096, we start by considering the given conditions. We know that \( n \) is a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power, which implies that \( n \) can be written as \( x^3 \) and \( t^4 \) for some integers \( x \) and \( t \).
  Given the conditions:
  - \( n \) is a perfect cube.
  - \( n \) is a perfect fourth power.
  We need to find the smallest such \( n \). We will use the fact that the least common multiple of 3 and 4 is 12, and thus \( n \) must be a multiple of \( 12^3 \).
  First, we calculate \( 12^3 \):
  \[ 12^3 = 12 \times 12 \times 12 = 1728 \]
  Since \( n \) must be a multiple of 1728, we check if \( n \) is at least 4096. We know that:
  \[ 4096 = 1728 \times 2 \]
  Thus, \( n \) must be at least 4096.

  -- We know that n is a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power, so n must be a multiple of 12^3.
  -- We calculate 12^3 = 1728.
  -- Since n must be a multiple of 1728, we check if n is at least 4096.
  -- We know that 4096 = 1728 * 2, so n must be at least 4096.
