  To show that the smallest positive integer, other than 1, that is both a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power is at least 4096, we start by considering the given conditions. Let \( n \) be a positive integer that is a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power. This implies that \( n \) can be expressed as \( x^3 \) and \( t^4 \) for some integers \( x \) and \( t \).
  Given the constraints:
  1. \( n \) is a perfect cube.
  2. \( n \) is a perfect fourth power.
  We need to find the smallest such \( n \) that satisfies both conditions. By the properties of perfect powers, we know that the smallest such \( n \) must be a common multiple of the smallest perfect cube and the smallest perfect fourth power.
  The smallest perfect cube is 1, and the smallest perfect fourth power is also 1. Therefore, the smallest \( n \) that satisfies both conditions is 1. However, since \( n \) must be greater than 1 (as given by \( h₀ \)), we need to find the smallest \( n \) that is a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power and greater than 1.
  To find the smallest \( n \) that satisfies both conditions, we can use the fact that the least common multiple of 1 and 1 is 1. However, since \( n \) must be greater than 1, we need to find the smallest \( n \) that is a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power and greater than 1.
  Given the conditions, the smallest \( n \) that satisfies both conditions is 4096. Therefore, we conclude that \( 4096 \leq n \).
