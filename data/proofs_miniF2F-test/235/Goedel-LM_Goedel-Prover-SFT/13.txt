  To show that the smallest positive integer, other than 1, that is both a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power is at least 4096, we proceed as follows:
  1. Let \( n \) be a positive integer that is both a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power.
  2. By the properties of perfect cubes and fourth powers, there exist integers \( x \) and \( t \) such that \( x^3 = n \) and \( t^4 = n \).
  3. We need to show that \( 4096 \leq n \).
  4. Using the given properties, we can express \( n \) in terms of \( x \) and \( t \).
  5. We know that \( x^3 \) and \( t^4 \) are both equal to \( n \).
  6. To find the smallest such \( n \), we consider the smallest possible values for \( x \) and \( t \).
  7. The smallest perfect cube greater than 1 is \( 8^3 = 512 \), and the smallest perfect fourth power greater than 1 is \( 16^4 = 65536 \).
  8. Since \( n \) must be a common multiple of both \( x^3 \) and \( t^4 \), we find that the smallest such \( n \) is the least common multiple of 512 and 65536, which is 4096.
  9. Therefore, \( 4096 \leq n \).
