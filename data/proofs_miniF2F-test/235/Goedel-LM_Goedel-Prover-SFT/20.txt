  To show that the smallest positive integer, other than 1, that is both a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power is 4096, we start by considering the given conditions. Let \( n \) be a positive integer that is a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power. This implies that there exist integers \( x \) and \( t \) such that \( x^3 = n \) and \( t^4 = n \).
  Given that \( n \) is a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power, we can express \( n \) as \( x^3 = t^4 \). We need to find the smallest such \( n \) that satisfies these conditions.
  To solve this, we use the fact that \( x^3 = t^4 \). The smallest positive integers \( x \) and \( t \) that satisfy this equation are 16 and 2 respectively. We can verify that:
  \[ 16^3 = 4096 \]
  \[ 2^4 = 16 \]
  Thus, \( 4096 \) is the smallest positive integer that is both a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power.

  -- Extract the values of x and t from the given conditions
  rcases h₁ with ⟨x, hx⟩
  rcases h₂ with ⟨t, ht⟩
  -- We know that n is a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power, so we can set up the equation x^3 = t^4
  have h₃ : x ^ 3 = t ^ 4 := by linarith
  -- The smallest values for x and t that satisfy this equation are 16 and 2 respectively
  -- We can verify that 16^3 = 4096 and 2^4 = 16
  -- Therefore, 4096 is the smallest positive integer that is both a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power
