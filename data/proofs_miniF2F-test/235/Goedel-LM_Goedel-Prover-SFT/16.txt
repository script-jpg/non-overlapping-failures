  To show that the smallest positive integer, other than 1, that is both a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power is 4096, we proceed as follows:
  1. **Identify the conditions**: We are given that \( n \) is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, and \( n \) is both a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power.
  2. **Express the conditions mathematically**:
     - \( n \) is a perfect cube: \( n = x^3 \) for some integer \( x \).
     - \( n \) is a perfect fourth power: \( n = t^4 \) for some integer \( t \).
  3. **Equate the two expressions for \( n \)**:
     - \( x^3 = t^4 \).
  4. **Solve for \( x \) and \( t \)**:
     - We need to find the smallest \( n \) that satisfies both conditions. By examining the smallest possible values, we find that \( n = 4096 \) is the smallest number that meets both criteria.
  5. **Verify the smallest number**:
     - Check that 4096 is indeed the smallest number that is a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power.

      -- Since x^3 < 4096, x must be less than 16.
