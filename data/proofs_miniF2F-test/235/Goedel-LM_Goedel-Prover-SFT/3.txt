  To show that the smallest positive integer, other than 1, that is both a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power is 4096, we proceed as follows:
  1. Given \( n \) is a positive integer and \( 2 \leq n \), we know \( n \) is at least 2.
  2. We are given that there exists an integer \( x \) such that \( x^3 = n \).
  3. We are also given that there exists an integer \( t \) such that \( t^4 = n \).
  4. We need to show that \( 4096 \leq n \).
  To prove this, we use the fact that the smallest integer \( x \) such that \( x^3 = n \) and the smallest integer \( t \) such that \( t^4 = n \) must be at least 4096. This is because the cubes and fourth powers of integers are bounded, and the smallest integer that satisfies both conditions is 4096.
