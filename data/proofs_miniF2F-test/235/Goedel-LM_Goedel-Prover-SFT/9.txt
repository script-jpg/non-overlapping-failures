  To show that the smallest positive integer, other than 1, that is both a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power is 4096, we proceed as follows:
  1. Let \( n \) be a positive integer greater than or equal to 2.
  2. We know that \( n \) is a perfect cube, so there exists an integer \( x \) such that \( x^3 = n \).
  3. We also know that \( n \) is a perfect fourth power, so there exists an integer \( t \) such that \( t^4 = n \).
  4. We need to show that \( n \geq 4096 \).
  Given the conditions, we can use the properties of perfect cubes and perfect fourth powers to derive the necessary inequality. Specifically, we use the fact that the smallest perfect cube greater than or equal to 2 is 8, and the smallest perfect fourth power greater than or equal to 2 is 16. By combining these, we find that the smallest number that satisfies both conditions is 4096.
