  To show that the smallest positive integer, other than 1, that is both a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power is 4096, we start by considering the given conditions. We know that there exist integers \( x \) and \( t \) such that \( x^3 = n \) and \( t^4 = n \). We need to find the smallest such \( n \).
  Given the conditions, we can set up the equation \( x^3 = t^4 \). This implies that \( n \) must be a common multiple of both \( x^3 \) and \( t^4 \). To find the smallest such \( n \), we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of \( x^3 \) and \( t^4 \).
  Since \( x^3 \) and \( t^4 \) are both powers of integers, their LCM is \( (x \cdot t)^3 \cdot t^4 \). To ensure that \( n \) is a perfect fourth power, we need \( (x \cdot t)^3 \cdot t^4 \) to be a perfect fourth power. This simplifies to \( (x \cdot t)^3 \cdot t^4 = (x \cdot t)^7 \).
  Given that \( (x \cdot t)^7 \) must be a perfect fourth power, we need to find the smallest \( n \) that satisfies this condition. We know that \( 4^7 = 16384 \) and \( 7^7 = 823543 \). Since \( 4^7 \) is a perfect fourth power, we can use it to find the smallest \( n \).
  Thus, the smallest positive integer \( n \) that is both a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power is 4096.

  -- We need to find the smallest n that is a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power.
  -- We start by setting up the equation x^3 = t^4.
  -- This implies that n must be a common multiple of both x^3 and t^4.
  -- To find the smallest such n, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of x^3 and t^4.
  -- Since x^3 and t^4 are both powers of integers, their LCM is (x * t)^3 * t^4.
  -- To ensure that n is a perfect fourth power, we need (x * t)^3 * t^4 to be a perfect fourth power.
  -- This simplifies to (x * t)^3 * t^4 = (x * t)^7.
  -- Given that (x * t)^7 must be a perfect fourth power, we need to find the smallest n that satisfies this condition.
  -- We know that 4^7 = 16384 and 7^7 = 823543.
  -- Since 4^7 is a perfect fourth power, we can use it to find the smallest n.
