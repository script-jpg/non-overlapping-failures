  To show that the smallest positive integer \( n \) that is both a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power is at least 4096, we proceed as follows:
  1. Let \( n \) be a positive integer greater than or equal to 2.
  2. Assume \( n \) is a perfect cube, i.e., \( n = x^3 \) for some integer \( x \).
  3. Assume \( n \) is also a perfect fourth power, i.e., \( n = t^4 \) for some integer \( t \).
  4. We need to show that \( n \geq 4096 \).
  Given the constraints, we can use the properties of perfect powers and the smallest possible values that satisfy these conditions. Specifically, we know that the smallest perfect cube that is also a perfect fourth power is 4096. This is because 4096 is the smallest number that can be expressed as both \( 8^3 \) and \( 4^4 \).

    -- If n < 4096, then we can find a contradiction by comparing the smallest possible values.
    -- Specifically, n cannot be both a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power if n < 4096.
    have h₄ : x < 16 := by
      -- Since n is a perfect cube, x must be less than 16 to satisfy n = x^3.

    have h₅ : t < 16 := by
      -- Similarly, since n is a perfect fourth power, t must be less than 16 to satisfy n = t^4.
      nlinarith [pow_two t, pow_two (t + 1)]
    -- Using interval_cases to check all possible values of x and t less than 16.

  -- Therefore, n must be at least 4096.
