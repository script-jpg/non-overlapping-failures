  To show that the smallest positive integer \( n \) that is both a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power is 4096, we proceed as follows:
  1. Let \( n \) be a positive integer greater than or equal to 2.
  2. We know that \( n \) is a perfect cube, so there exists an integer \( x \) such that \( x^3 = n \).
  3. We also know that \( n \) is a perfect fourth power, so there exists an integer \( t \) such that \( t^4 = n \).
  4. We need to show that \( n \geq 4096 \).
  Given the constraints:
  - \( n \) is a perfect cube.
  - \( n \) is a perfect fourth power.
  We can express \( n \) as \( x^3 \) and \( t^4 \) for some integers \( x \) and \( t \).
  To find the smallest such \( n \), we consider the smallest possible values for \( x \) and \( t \):
  - The smallest integer \( x \) such that \( x^3 \geq 4096 \) is 16.
  - The smallest integer \( t \) such that \( t^4 \geq 4096 \) is 4.
  Thus, the smallest \( n \) that satisfies both conditions is \( 16^3 = 4096 \).
  Therefore, \( n \geq 4096 \).

  -- We know that x and t are the smallest integers such that x^3 and t^4 are at least 4096.
  -- We can use the fact that x^3 < 4096 and t^4 < 4096 to derive a contradiction.
