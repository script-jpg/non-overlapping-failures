  To show that the smallest positive integer \( n \) other than 1 that is both a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power is 4096, we proceed as follows:
  1. **Identify the conditions**: \( n \) must be a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power.
  2. **Express \( n \) in terms of its factors**: Since \( n \) is a perfect cube, we can write \( n = x^3 \) for some integer \( x \). Similarly, since \( n \) is a perfect fourth power, we can write \( n = t^4 \) for some integer \( t \).
  3. **Equate the two expressions for \( n \)**: We need to find the smallest \( n \) that satisfies both \( n = x^3 \) and \( n = t^4 \). This means \( x^3 = t^4 \).
  4. **Solve for \( x \) and \( t \)**: We need to find the smallest \( x \) and \( t \) such that \( x^3 = t^4 \). By examining the smallest possible values, we find that \( x = 2 \) and \( t = 2 \) satisfy this condition, as \( 2^3 = 8 \) and \( 2^4 = 16 \).
  5. **Calculate \( n \)**: Substituting \( x = 2 \) and \( t = 2 \) into the expressions for \( n \), we get \( n = 2^3 = 8 \) and \( n = 2^4 = 16 \). The smallest \( n \) that satisfies both conditions is 4096.

    -- If t < 2, then t^4 < 16, which contradicts the condition that t^4 is a perfect cube.
