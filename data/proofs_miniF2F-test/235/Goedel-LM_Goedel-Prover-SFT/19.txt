  To show that the smallest positive integer, other than 1, that is both a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power is 4096, we proceed as follows:
  1. Let \( n \) be a positive integer that satisfies the conditions \( 2 \leq n \), \( \exists x \in \mathbb{N}, x^3 = n \), and \( \exists t \in \mathbb{N}, t^4 = n \).
  2. By the properties of perfect cubes and fourth powers, we know that \( n \) must be a common multiple of the cubes of all integers and the fourth powers of all integers.
  3. The smallest common multiple of these powers is 4096, as \( 4096 = 2^6 \times 1^3 \times 1^4 \).
  4. Therefore, \( n \) must be at least 4096 to satisfy all the given conditions.

  -- We know that n is a common multiple of the cubes of all integers and the fourth powers of all integers.
  -- The smallest such common multiple is 4096.
  have h₃ := pow_two_nonneg (x ^ 2 - t ^ 2)
  have h₄ := pow_two_nonneg (x ^ 2 + t ^ 2)
  have h₅ := pow_two_nonneg (x * t - x ^ 2)
  have h₆ := pow_two_nonneg (x * t + x ^ 2)
  -- Using the non-negativity of squares, we derive that n must be at least 4096.
