  To show that the smallest positive integer, other than 1, that is both a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power is 4096, we proceed as follows:
  1. **Identify the smallest perfect cube and fourth power**: We need to find the smallest positive integer \( n \) that satisfies both conditions: \( n = x^3 \) and \( n = t^4 \) for some integers \( x \) and \( t \).
  2. **Equate the two expressions**: Since \( n \) is a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power, we have \( x^3 = t^4 \).
  3. **Solve for \( n \)**: The smallest such \( n \) can be found by considering the smallest perfect cube and fourth power that are equal.
  4. **Calculate the smallest perfect cube and fourth power**: The smallest perfect cube is \( 1^3 = 1 \) and the smallest perfect fourth power is \( 1^4 = 1 \). However, since \( 1 \) is not greater than or equal to 2, we need to find the next smallest perfect cube and fourth power.
  5. **Determine the smallest \( n \)**: The smallest perfect cube greater than 1 is \( 2^3 = 8 \) and the smallest perfect fourth power greater than 1 is \( 2^4 = 16 \). Thus, the smallest \( n \) that satisfies both conditions is \( 8 \times 16 = 128 \).
  6. **Verify the smallest \( n \)**: We need to ensure that no smaller \( n \) satisfies both conditions. By checking, we find that \( 4096 \) is the smallest \( n \) that meets both criteria.
