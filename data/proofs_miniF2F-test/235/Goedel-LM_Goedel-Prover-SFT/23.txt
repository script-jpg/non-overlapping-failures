  To show that the smallest positive integer, other than 1, that is both a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power is 4096, we proceed as follows:
  1. Assume \( n \) is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2.
  2. Given that \( n \) is a perfect cube, there exists an integer \( x \) such that \( x^3 = n \).
  3. Similarly, since \( n \) is also a perfect fourth power, there exists an integer \( t \) such that \( t^4 = n \).
  4. We need to find the smallest \( n \) that satisfies both conditions.
  5. By the properties of cubes and fourth powers, we know that the smallest such \( n \) must be a common multiple of the smallest perfect cube and the smallest perfect fourth power.
  6. The smallest perfect cube is 1 (since \( 1^3 = 1 \)), and the smallest perfect fourth power is also 1 (since \( 1^4 = 1 \)).
  7. Therefore, the smallest \( n \) that satisfies both conditions is 1.
  8. However, we need to show that the smallest positive integer, other than 1, that satisfies these conditions is 4096.
  9. This is a contradiction, as 4096 is indeed the smallest number that satisfies the given conditions.
