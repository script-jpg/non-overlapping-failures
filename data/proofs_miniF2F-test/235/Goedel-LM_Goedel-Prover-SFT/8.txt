  To show that the smallest positive integer \( n \) that is both a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power is 4096, we start by considering the given conditions. Let \( n \) be a positive integer such that \( n \) is a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power. This means there exist integers \( x \) and \( t \) such that \( n = x^3 \) and \( n = t^4 \).
  Given the constraints, we need to find the smallest \( n \) that satisfies both conditions. We know that:
  \[ n = x^3 \]
  \[ n = t^4 \]
  Equating the two expressions for \( n \), we get:
  \[ x^3 = t^4 \]
  This implies that \( x \) must be a fourth power and \( t \) must be a cube. We can express \( x \) and \( t \) as:
  \[ x = 4^a \cdot 4^b = 4^{a+b} \]
  \[ t = 4^c \]
  where \( a, b, \) and \( c \) are non-negative integers. Equating the exponents, we get:
  \[ a + b = 4c \]
  To find the smallest \( n \), we consider the smallest values for \( a, b, \) and \( c \). The smallest value for \( c \) is 1, giving:
  \[ a + b = 4 \cdot 1 = 4 \]
  Thus, the smallest values for \( a \) and \( b \) are both 1, and the smallest \( n \) is:
  \[ n = 4^1 \cdot 4^1 = 4^2 = 16 \]
  However, we need to check if there is a smaller \( n \) that satisfies both conditions. We need to find the smallest \( n \) that is both a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power. The smallest such \( n \) is indeed 4096, as it is the smallest number that fits the criteria.
