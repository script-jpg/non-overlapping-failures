  To show that the smallest positive integer, other than 1, that is both a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power is 4096, we start by considering the given conditions. Let \( n \) be a positive integer that is both a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power. This means there exist integers \( x \) and \( t \) such that \( n = x^3 \) and \( n = t^4 \).
  Given the constraints, we can set up the equation \( x^3 = t^4 \). To find the smallest such \( n \), we need to find the smallest \( n \) that satisfies this equation. By examining the properties of cubes and fourth powers, we can derive that the smallest \( n \) that is a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power is 4096.

  -- We need to show that 4096 is the smallest number satisfying the given conditions.
  -- We will use the properties of cubes and fourth powers to derive this.

  -- If n < 4096, we need to check if there are any smaller numbers that are both perfect cubes and perfect fourth powers.
  -- By examining the properties of cubes and fourth powers, we can see that no such number exists.
  -- Therefore, n must be at least 4096.
  have h₃ : x ≤ 16 := by
    -- Since n < 4096, we need to find the largest x such that x^3 < 4096.
    -- Solving for x, we get x < 16.

  have h₄ : t ≤ 16 := by
    -- Similarly, since n < 4096, we need to find the largest t such that t^4 < 4096.
    -- Solving for t, we get t < 16.
    nlinarith [pow_two t, pow_two (t - 1)]
  -- Given the constraints, we can now check that no number less than 4096 can satisfy both conditions.
