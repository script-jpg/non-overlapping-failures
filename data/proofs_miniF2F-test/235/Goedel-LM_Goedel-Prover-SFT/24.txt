rcases h₁ with ⟨x, hx⟩
  rcases h₂ with ⟨t, ht⟩
  have h₁ : x ≤ t := by
    -- Since x^3 = n and t^4 = n, we know x ≤ t because x^3 ≤ t^4 for x ≤ t
    nlinarith [pow_two x, pow_two t, pow_two (x + t)]
  -- Since n = x^3 and n = t^4, we know n ≥ 4096 because t ≥ 16
  have h₂ : x ≥ 16 := by
    -- We need x^3 ≥ 4096, so x ≥ 16
    nlinarith [pow_two x, pow_two t, pow_two (x - t)]
  nlinarith
