  To show that the smallest positive integer, other than 1, that is both a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power is 4096, we proceed as follows:
  1. **Identify the conditions**: We are given that \( n \) is a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power. This means there exist integers \( x \) and \( t \) such that \( n = x^3 \) and \( n = t^4 \).
  2. **Set up the equation**: From the conditions, we have \( x^3 = t^4 \). This implies \( n = x^3 = t^4 \).
  3. **Solve for \( n \)**: To find the smallest \( n \) that satisfies both conditions, we need to find the smallest \( n \) that is a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power.
  4. **Calculate the smallest \( n \)**: The smallest \( n \) that is a perfect cube and a perfect fourth power is 4096. This can be verified by checking the smallest integers \( x \) and \( t \) such that \( x^3 = t^4 \) and \( x \geq 2 \) and \( t \geq 2 \).
  5. **Verify the smallest \( n \)**: We need to show that \( n = 4096 \) satisfies the conditions and is indeed the smallest such number.
