The proof of this theorem is straightforward: we need to show that 160 and 1058 are multiplicative inverses modulo 1399. This means that their product equals 1 modulo 1399.

First, we import the necessary libraries and set up the theorem statement:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

We've imported Mathlib for mathematical definitions and Aesop for automated tactics. We've also turned off the heartbeats limit to ensure the proof can run to completion, and opened several namespaces for relevant definitions.

Now, let's state the theorem:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_321 (n : ZMod 1399) (h₁ : n = 160⁻¹) : n = 1058 := by 
```

We have a variable `n` of type `ZMod 1399` (integers modulo 1399), and we're told that `n = 160⁻¹`, which means `n` is the multiplicative inverse of 160 modulo 1399. We need to prove that `n = 1058`.

To prove this, we need to show that 160 and 1058 are multiplicative inverses modulo 1399. In other words, we need to show that \(160 \times 1058 \equiv 1 \pmod{1399}\).

Let's complete the proof:

```tactics
rw [ZMod.inv_eq_iff_mul_eq_one]
native_decide
```

These two tactics complete the proof. The first tactic rewrites the goal using the definition of the multiplicative inverse in modular arithmetic. The second tactic uses Lean's computational engine to verify that 160 × 1058 ≡ 1 (mod 1399).

The key mathematical insight is that 160 and 1058 are multiplicative inverses because:
\(160 \times 1058 = 168960\)
When divided by 1399, the remainder is 1. 

Thus, \(160 \times 1058 \equiv 1 \pmod{1399}\), making 1058 the multiplicative inverse of 160 modulo 1399.
