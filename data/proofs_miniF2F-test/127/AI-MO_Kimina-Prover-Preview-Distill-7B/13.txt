  -- the unit group of ZMod 1399 is a cyclic group of order 1399 - 1 = 1398.

  -- Since 1398 = 2 * 3 * 233, we should choose 233 as the order of element 160.

  -- The conditions 160 ≠ 0 and 160 ≠ 1 are satisfied.

  -- Hence, the multiplicative order of 160 is 2 * 3 * 233 = 1398.

  -- This implies that 160 is a generating element of the unit group.

  -- Therefore, 160⁻¹ is the same as 1058.
