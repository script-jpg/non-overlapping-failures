-- We need to find an integer $n$ with $0 \leq n < 1399$ that is the multiplicative inverse of 160 modulo 1399.
  -- This means that $160 \cdot n \equiv 1 \pmod{1399}$.

  -- Now we have $160 \cdot n = 1$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{1399}$, which implies $160 \cdot n \equiv 1 \pmod{1399}$.

  -- Since $160 \cdot n \equiv 1 \pmod{1399}$, we can find $n$ by computing $160^{-1} \bmod 1399$.
  -- To find the multiplicative inverse of 160 modulo 1399, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm.

    -- We use the `ZMod.inv_eq_of_mul_eq_one` lemma to find the multiplicative inverse.
