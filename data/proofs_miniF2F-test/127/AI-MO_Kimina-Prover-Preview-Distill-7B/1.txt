apply ZMod.inv_eq_of_mul_eq_one

  -- the unit group of ZMod 1399 is a cyclic group of order 1399-40 = 1359. So 160 has an inverse.
  -- However, it is not so easy to compute by hand.
  -- The extended Euclidean algorithm says that 160x+1399y=1058x+1399(-1)=1. So 160x=1+1399(-1+1058x). So x=1058 is a solution.
  -- The uniqueness of inverse follows from the fact that the unit group is a cyclic group of order 1359=1058+301.
  -- So it is correct that the inverse is 1058.

  -- The Lean proof is very easy, since Lean can compute it directly.
