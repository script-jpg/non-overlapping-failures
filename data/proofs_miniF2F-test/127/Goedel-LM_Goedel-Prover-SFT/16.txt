  To find some integer \( n \) with \( 0 \leq n < 1399 \) such that \( n \) is the multiplicative inverse to 160 modulo 1399, we need to show that \( n = 1058 \). This can be achieved by demonstrating that \( 1058 \times 160 \equiv 1 \pmod{1399} \).

  -- We need to show that the element n in ZMod 1399, which is 160⁻¹, is equal to 1058.
  apply Eq.symm
  -- Simplify the given equation n = 160⁻¹ to show that n = 1058.
