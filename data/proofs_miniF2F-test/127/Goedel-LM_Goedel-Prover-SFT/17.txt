  To solve the problem, we need to find an integer \( n \) such that \( 0 \leq n < 1399 \) and \( n \) is the multiplicative inverse to 160 modulo 1399. We start by verifying that \( 35 \cdot 40 = 1400 \). This implies that 1400 is a multiple of 1399, and we need to find a number \( n \) such that \( n \equiv 1 \pmod{1399} \) and \( n \equiv 160^{-1} \pmod{1399} \).
  Given \( n = 160^{-1} \), we need to show that \( n = 1058 \). We use the fact that \( 160 \cdot 1058 \equiv 1 \pmod{1399} \), which simplifies the calculation.

  -- We use the reflexivity of equality to conclude that n = 1058.
