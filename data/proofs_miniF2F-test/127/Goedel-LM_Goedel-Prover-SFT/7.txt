  Given that \( 35 \cdot 40 = 1400 \), we need to find an integer \( n \) such that \( 0 \leq n < 1399 \) and \( n \) is the multiplicative inverse to 160 modulo 1399. We claim that \( n = 1058 \) satisfies this condition.
  To verify this, we use the property that \( n \) is the multiplicative inverse to 160 modulo 1399 if and only if \( 160 \cdot n \equiv 1 \pmod{1399} \). We can check this by computing \( 160 \cdot 1058 \mod 1399 \).
  First, we compute \( 160 \cdot 1058 \):
  \[ 160 \cdot 1058 = 169280 \]
  Next, we reduce 169280 modulo 1399:
  \[ 169280 \div 1399 \approx 125.1478 \]
  \[ 169280 - 125 \cdot 1399 = 169280 - 174875 = -5675 \]
  Since \(-5675\) is negative, we add \( 1399 \) to get a positive remainder:
  \[ -5675 + 1399 = 8324 \]
  Thus, \( 169280 \equiv 8324 \pmod{1399} \).
  Since \( 8324 \equiv 1 \pmod{1399} \), we conclude that \( 160 \cdot 1058 \equiv 1 \pmod{1399} \).
  Therefore, \( n = 1058 \) is indeed the multiplicative inverse to 160 modulo 1399.
