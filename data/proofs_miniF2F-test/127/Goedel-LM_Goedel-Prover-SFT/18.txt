  Given that \( 35 \cdot 40 = 1400 \), we need to find some integer \( n \) with \( 0 \leq n < 1399 \) such that \( n \) is the multiplicative inverse to 160 modulo 1399. We claim that \( n = 1058 \).
  To verify this, we start by expressing \( n \) as the multiplicative inverse of 160 modulo 1399. We then use the property that the product of 160 and 1058 should equal 1399, as 1058 is the inverse of 160 modulo 1399. We simplify the expression using numerical computations to confirm that \( 160 \cdot 1058 = 1399 \).
