  To solve the problem, we need to find an integer \( n \) such that \( 0 \leq n < 1399 \) and \( n \) is the multiplicative inverse to 160 modulo 1399. We are given that \( n = 160^{-1} \). To find \( n \), we use the fact that the multiplicative inverse of 160 modulo 1399 is 1058. This can be verified by checking that \( 160 \times 1058 \equiv 1 \pmod{1399} \).
