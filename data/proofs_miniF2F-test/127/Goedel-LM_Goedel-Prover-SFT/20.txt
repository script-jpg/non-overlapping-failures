  To find an integer \( n \) with \( 0 \leq n < 1399 \) such that \( n \) is the multiplicative inverse to 160 modulo 1399, we need to show that \( n = 1058 \).
  1. Start by expressing \( n \) in terms of its inverse.
  2. Use the fact that \( 35 \cdot 40 = 1400 \) to simplify the expression.
  3. Verify that \( 1058 \) is indeed the multiplicative inverse of 160 modulo 1399.
