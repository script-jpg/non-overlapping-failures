  To find an integer \( n \) such that \( 0 \leq n < 1399 \) and \( n \) is the multiplicative inverse to 160 modulo 1399, we need to show that \( n = 1058 \). Given that \( n = 160^{-1} \), we can use the property of modular inverses to directly assert that \( n = 1058 \).
  -/
  -- We know from the problem statement that n is the multiplicative inverse to 160 modulo 1399.
  -- This implies that n * 160 ≡ 1 (mod 1399).
  -- Given that n = 160⁻¹, we can directly assert that n = 1058.
  norm_num at h₁
  -- The `norm_num` tactic is used to perform numerical normalization, ensuring that the given value of n is correct.
  norm_num
  -- The `norm_num` tactic is used again to ensure the numerical correctness of the value.
  rw [h₁]
  -- The `rw` tactic is used to rewrite the goal using the given hypothesis h₁, confirming that n = 1058.
  rfl
  -- The `rfl` tactic is used to confirm that the left-hand side equals the right-hand side, completing the proof.
