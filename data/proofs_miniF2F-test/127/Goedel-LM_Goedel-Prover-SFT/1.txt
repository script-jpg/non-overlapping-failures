  To solve the problem, we need to find an integer \( n \) such that \( 0 \leq n < 1399 \) and \( n \) is the multiplicative inverse of 160 modulo 1399. We are given that \( n = 160^{-1} \). We will use the properties of modular arithmetic and the given information to find \( n \).
  1. Start by rewriting the equation \( n = 160^{-1} \) using the properties of modular inverses.
  2. Verify that \( n = 1058 \) satisfies the conditions \( 0 \leq n < 1399 \).
  3. Check that \( 35 \cdot 40 \equiv 1 \pmod{1399} \), confirming that \( n = 1058 \) is indeed the multiplicative inverse of 160 modulo 1399.
