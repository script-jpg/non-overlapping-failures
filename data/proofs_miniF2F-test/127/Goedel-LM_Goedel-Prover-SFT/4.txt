rw [h₁]
  -- We need to find an integer n such that n is the multiplicative inverse of 160 modulo 1399.
  -- We know that 35 * 40 = 1400, so we use 35 as a candidate for n.
  rw [show (160⁻¹ : ZMod 1399) = 1058 by rfl]
  -- By reflexivity, we confirm that the inverse of 160 modulo 1399 is indeed 1058.
