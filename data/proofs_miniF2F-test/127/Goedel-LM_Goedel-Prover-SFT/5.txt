  To find an integer \( n \) such that \( 0 \leq n < 1399 \) and \( n \) is the multiplicative inverse to 160 modulo 1399, we need to show that \( n = 1058 \). Given that \( n \) is the multiplicative inverse to 160 modulo 1399, we can use the properties of modular arithmetic to verify this. Specifically, we need to check that \( 160 \cdot 1058 \equiv 1 \pmod{1399} \).
