  Given the integer \( n \) such that \( 0 \leq n < 1399 \) and \( n \) is the multiplicative inverse to 160 modulo 1399, we need to show that \( n = 1058 \).
  1. Start by expressing \( n \) as the multiplicative inverse of 160 modulo 1399.
  2. Use the property of the multiplicative inverse in the ring of integers modulo 1399.
  3. Verify that \( 1058 \) satisfies the condition \( n = 160^{-1} \) modulo 1399 by checking the congruence.
