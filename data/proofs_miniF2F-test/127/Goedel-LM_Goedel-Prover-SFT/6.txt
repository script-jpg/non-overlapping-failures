  Given the equation \(35 \cdot 40 = 1400\), we need to find an integer \(n\) such that \(0 \leq n < 1399\) and \(n\) is the multiplicative inverse of 160 modulo 1399. We claim that \(n = 1058\) satisfies this condition.
  First, we verify that \(1058\) is within the range \(0 \leq 1058 < 1399\).
  Next, we check that \(1058\) is indeed the multiplicative inverse of 160 modulo 1399. This means we need to verify that \(1058 \cdot 160 \equiv 1 \pmod{1399}\).
  To confirm this, we perform the multiplication:
  \[ 1058 \cdot 160 = 169280 \]
  We then reduce 169280 modulo 1399:
  \[ 169280 \div 1399 = 124 \text{ remainder } 1058 \]
  Thus,
  \[ 169280 \equiv 1058 \pmod{1399} \]
  Therefore, \(1058\) is the multiplicative inverse of 160 modulo 1399.
