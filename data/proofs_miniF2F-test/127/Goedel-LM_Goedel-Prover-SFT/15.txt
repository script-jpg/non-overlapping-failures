  To find an integer \( n \) such that \( 0 \leq n < 1399 \) and \( n \) is the multiplicative inverse to 160 modulo 1399, we need to solve the congruence \( 160n \equiv 1 \pmod{1399} \). Given that \( 35 \cdot 40 = 1400 \), we can use the properties of modular arithmetic to find \( n \). Specifically, we can use the fact that \( 160 \cdot 1058 \equiv 1 \pmod{1399} \). This can be verified by direct computation or by using the properties of modular inverses.
