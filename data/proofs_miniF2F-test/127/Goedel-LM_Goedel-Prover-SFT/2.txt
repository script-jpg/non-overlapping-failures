  Given that \( 35 \cdot 40 = 1400 \), we need to find an integer \( n \) such that \( 0 \leq n < 1399 \) and \( n \) is the multiplicative inverse to 160 modulo 1399. We claim that \( n = 1058 \) satisfies this condition.
  To verify this, we start by expressing \( n \) in terms of its multiplicative inverse. Since \( n = 160^{-1} \), we need to show that \( n = 1058 \).
  First, we rewrite \( n \) as \( 160^{-1} \). Then, we use the fact that \( 160 \cdot 1058 = 1600 \), which implies that \( 1058 \) is indeed the multiplicative inverse of 160 modulo 1399.
