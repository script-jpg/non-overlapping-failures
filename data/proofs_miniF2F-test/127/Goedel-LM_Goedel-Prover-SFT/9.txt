  To solve the problem, we need to find an integer \( n \) such that \( 0 \leq n < 1399 \) and \( n \) is the multiplicative inverse to 160 modulo 1399. We are given that \( n = 160^{-1} \) and we need to show that \( n = 1058 \).
  1. Start by rewriting \( n \) as \( 160^{-1} \).
  2. Use property of modular inverses to rewrite \( 160^{-1} \) as \( 1058 \).
  3. Verify that \( 1058 \) is indeed the modular inverse of 160 modulo 1399 by checking that \( 160 \times 1058 \equiv 1 \pmod{1399} \).

  -- Substitute the given value of n into the equation.
  rw [h₁]
  -- Rewrite the modular inverse of 160 modulo 1399 as 1058.
  rw [show (160 : ZMod 1399)⁻¹ = 1058 by rfl]
  -- The reflexivity of equality confirms that 1058 is the modular inverse of 160 modulo 1399.
