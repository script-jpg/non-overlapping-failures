  Given that \( 35 \cdot 40 = 1400 \), we need to find an integer \( n \) with \( 0 \leq n < 1399 \) such that \( n \) is the multiplicative inverse to 160 modulo 1399. We are to show that \( n = 1058 \).
  To solve this, we start by noting that \( 160 \cdot 1058 = 169280 \). We then compute the remainder of 169280 when divided by 1399, which is 1. This confirms that 1058 is indeed the multiplicative inverse of 160 modulo 1399.

  -- We use the property that the inverse of a number modulo n is the number whose product with the original number is 1 modulo n.
