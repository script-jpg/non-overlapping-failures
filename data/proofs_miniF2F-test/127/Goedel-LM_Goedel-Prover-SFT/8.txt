  Given that \( 35 \cdot 40 = 1400 \), we need to find some integer \( n \) with \( 0 \leq n < 1399 \) such that \( n \) is the multiplicative inverse to 160 modulo 1399. We need to show that \( n = 1058 \).
  1. Start by expressing \( n \) in terms of the multiplicative inverse of 160 modulo 1399.
  2. Use the given equality \( 35 \cdot 40 = 1400 \) to verify the multiplicative inverse.
  3. Simplify the expression using algebraic properties and the fact that \( 35 \cdot 40 = 1400 \).
  4. Normalize the numerical values to confirm the result.
