  We need to find an integer \( n \) such that \( 0 \leq n < 1399 \) and \( n \) is the multiplicative inverse of 160 modulo 1399. We claim that \( n = 1058 \) satisfies these conditions. To verify this, we substitute \( n = 1058 \) into the given equation \( n = 160^{-1} \) and simplify using properties of modular arithmetic.
