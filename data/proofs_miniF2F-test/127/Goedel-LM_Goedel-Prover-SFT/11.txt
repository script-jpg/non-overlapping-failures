  Given the integer \( n \) with \( 0 \leq n < 1399 \) such that \( n \) is the multiplicative inverse to 160 modulo 1399, we need to show that \( n = 1058 \). This involves finding \( n \) such that \( n \cdot 160 \equiv 1 \pmod{1399} \). By the extended Euclidean algorithm, the inverse of 160 modulo 1399 can be computed, and it is found to be 1058.
