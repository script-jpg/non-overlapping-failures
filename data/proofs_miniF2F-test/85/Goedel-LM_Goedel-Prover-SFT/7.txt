  Given a positive integer \( n \) and the condition that \( 2^n - 1 \) is prime, we need to show that \( n \) is also prime. We will use a proof by contradiction. Assume \( n \) is not prime. Then \( n \) must be composite. By the properties of prime numbers and the given condition, we can derive a contradiction, specifically that \( 2^n - 1 \) cannot be prime if \( n \) is composite.

  apply Nat.Prime.irreducible
  -- Rewrite the primality condition for \( 2^n - 1 \) using the definition of prime numbers.
  rw [Nat.prime_def_lt] at h₁
  -- Use the fact that \( n \) is positive to apply the properties of powers and prime numbers.
  have h₂ := h₁ 1
  have h₃ := h₁ 2
  -- Simplify the expressions involving powers and prime numbers.
  simp at h₂ h₃
  -- Use the `omega` tactic to solve the resulting arithmetic and logical expressions.
