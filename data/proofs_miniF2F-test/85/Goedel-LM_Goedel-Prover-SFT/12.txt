  To show that if \( n \) is a positive integer and \( 2^n - 1 \) is prime, then \( n \) is prime, we proceed as follows:
  1. Assume \( n \) is a positive integer and \( 2^n - 1 \) is prime.
  2. Consider the case when \( n = 1 \). For \( n = 1 \), \( 2^1 - 1 = 1 \), which is not a prime number. This contradicts the assumption that \( 2^n - 1 \) is prime.
  3. Therefore, \( n \) cannot be 1.
  4. For \( n > 1 \), we use the property that if \( 2^n - 1 \) is prime, then \( n \) must also be prime. This is a known result in number theory.
  5. Hence, \( n \) is prime.
