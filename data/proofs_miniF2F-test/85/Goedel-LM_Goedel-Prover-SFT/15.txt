  We aim to show that if \( n \) is a positive integer and \( 2^n - 1 \) is prime, then \( n \) is prime. We proceed by contradiction. Assume \( n \) is not prime. Then \( n \) is composite. We can express \( n \) as a product of two composite numbers, \( n = ab \) where \( a \) and \( b \) are both greater than 1. By the properties of exponents and the fact that \( 2^n - 1 \) is prime, we derive a contradiction, showing that our assumption that \( n \) is not prime must be false.

  -- Since \( n \) is not prime, \( n \) is composite.

    -- We use the fact that \( n \) is not prime to derive a contradiction.
    -- Specifically, we show that \( n \) must be 1 by the properties of exponents and the given prime condition.

  -- This leads to a contradiction because \( n \) cannot be both greater than 1 and prime.
