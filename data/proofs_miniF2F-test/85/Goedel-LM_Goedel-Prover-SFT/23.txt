  We aim to show that if \( n \) is a positive integer and \( 2^n - 1 \) is prime, then \( n \) is prime. We will use the properties of prime numbers and modular arithmetic to derive this result.
  1. Assume \( n \) is a positive integer and \( 2^n - 1 \) is prime.
  2. We will show that if \( n \) is not prime, then \( 2^n - 1 \) cannot be prime by examining specific values of \( n \) and using the properties of prime numbers.
  3. Specifically, we will consider \( n = 0 \) and \( n = 1 \) and show that \( 2^n - 1 \) is not prime for these values, leading to a contradiction.
