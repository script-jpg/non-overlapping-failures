  To show that if \( n \) is a positive integer and \( 2^n - 1 \) is prime, then \( n \) is prime, we proceed by contradiction. Assume \( n \) is not prime. Then there exists a positive integer \( k \) such that \( k \) divides \( n \). We will show that \( 2^n - 1 \) cannot be prime under this assumption.
  1. **Assumption and Setup**: Assume \( n \) is not prime, so there exists a \( k \) such that \( k > 1 \) and \( k \mid n \).
  2. **Exponentiation and Prime Property**: Since \( 2^n - 1 \) is prime, it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
  3. **Divisibility and Prime Property**: If \( 2^n - 1 \) is prime, then \( 2^n - 1 \) must be a prime number. However, if \( n \) is not prime, then \( 2^n - 1 \) cannot be prime because it would imply a contradiction in the properties of prime numbers.
  4. **Contradiction**: Therefore, \( n \) must be prime.
