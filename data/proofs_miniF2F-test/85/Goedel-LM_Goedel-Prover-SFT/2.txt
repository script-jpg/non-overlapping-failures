  We aim to show that if \( n \) is a positive integer and \( 2^n - 1 \) is prime, then \( n \) is prime. We will proceed by contradiction. Assume \( n \) is not prime. We will show that this leads to a contradiction by examining the prime factors of \( 2^n - 1 \).
  1. Assume \( n \) is not prime. This means \( n \) can be factored into two smaller positive integers.
  2. Consider the prime factors of \( 2^n - 1 \). Since \( 2^n - 1 \) is prime, it must have no prime factors other than 1 and itself.
  3. If \( n \) is not prime, then \( 2^n - 1 \) can be expressed as a product of two smaller primes, which contradicts the primality of \( 2^n - 1 \).
  4. Therefore, \( n \) must be prime.

  -- Using the fact that \( 2^n - 1 \) is prime, we derive a contradiction.
