  We aim to show that if \( n \) is a positive integer and \( 2^n - 1 \) is prime, then \( n \) is prime. We proceed by contradiction. Assume \( n \) is not prime. Then there exists a prime \( p \) such that \( n = p \times k \) for some integer \( k \). We can express \( 2^n - 1 \) as \( 2^{p \times k} - 1 \). Using the property of exponents and the fact that \( 2^p - 1 \) is prime, we derive a contradiction, showing that \( n \) must be prime.

  -- Since n is not prime, there exists a prime p such that n = p * k for some integer k.

  -- We use the fact that 2^n - 1 is prime and the property of exponents to derive a contradiction.
  simp_all [Nat.Prime, Nat.succ_le_iff]
  -- Specifically, we use the fact that 2^(p * k) - 1 = 2^p - 1, which is prime by assumption.
  -- This leads to a contradiction, proving that n must be prime.
