  We aim to show that if \( n \) is a positive integer and \( 2^n - 1 \) is prime, then \( n \) is prime. We proceed by contradiction. Assume \( n \) is not prime. Then there exists a number \( k \) such that \( 1 < k < n \). We can express \( 2^n - 1 \) as a product of two factors: \( 2^k - 1 \) and \( 2^{n-k} - 1 \). Since \( 2^k - 1 \) and \( 2^{n-k} - 1 \) are both less than \( 2^n - 1 \), they must be factors of \( 2^n - 1 \). However, since \( 2^n - 1 \) is prime, this leads to a contradiction, as \( 2^n - 1 \) cannot be expressed as a product of two factors both less than itself. Therefore, \( n \) must be prime.
