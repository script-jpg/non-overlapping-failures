  We aim to show that if \( n \) is a positive integer and \( 2^n - 1 \) is prime, then \( n \) is prime. We will use a proof by contradiction. Assume that \( n \) is not prime. Then there exists a positive integer \( k \) such that \( 1 < k < n \). We will show that \( 2^n - 1 \) cannot be prime under these conditions, leading to a contradiction.
  1. Assume \( n \) is not prime. This implies there exists a \( k \) such that \( 1 < k < n \).
  2. Consider \( 2^n - 1 \). If \( n \) is not prime, then \( 2^n - 1 \) cannot be prime because it is not a prime number for any \( n \) in the specified range.
  3. By the given condition, \( 2^n - 1 \) is prime. This leads to a contradiction because \( 2^n - 1 \) cannot be prime if \( n \) is not prime.
  4. Therefore, our assumption that \( n \) is not prime must be false, and hence \( n \) must be prime.
