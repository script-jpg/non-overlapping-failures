  We aim to show that if \( n \) is a positive integer and \( 2^n - 1 \) is prime, then \( n \) is prime. We proceed by contradiction. Assume \( n \) is not prime. Then \( n \) can be expressed as a product of two integers, \( n = ab \) where \( 1 < a < b \). We then analyze the prime property of \( 2^n - 1 \) under these conditions.

  -- Since \( n \) is not prime, we can write \( n = ab \) where \( 1 < a < b \).
  have h₂ : n ≠ 0 := by linarith
  -- Using the fact that \( n \neq 0 \), we can express \( n \) as a product of two integers.
  have h₃ : n = a * b := ⟨a, b, by simp [h₂], by simp [h₂]⟩
  -- Substitute \( n = ab \) into the inequality \( 1 < a < b \).
  rw [h₃] at h₁
  -- Since \( 1 < a < b \), we have \( a \) and \( b \) greater than 1.
  have h₄ : a > 0 := by linarith
  have h₅ : b > 0 := by linarith
  -- The prime property of \( 2^n - 1 \) is analyzed under these conditions.
