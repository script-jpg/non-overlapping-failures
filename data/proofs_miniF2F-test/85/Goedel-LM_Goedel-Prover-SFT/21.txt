  Given a positive integer \( n \) such that \( 2^n - 1 \) is prime, we need to show that \( n \) is also a prime number. The proof proceeds by contradiction. Assume \( n \) is not prime. Then \( n \) can be factored into a product of two integers, both greater than 1. We can derive a contradiction by examining the properties of these factors and the primality of \( 2^n - 1 \).

  -- Since n is not prime, it can be factored into two integers greater than 1.
  -- We will use the fact that 2^n - 1 is prime to derive a contradiction.
