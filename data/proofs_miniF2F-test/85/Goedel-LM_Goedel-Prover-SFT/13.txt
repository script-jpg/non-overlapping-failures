  We aim to show that if \( n \) is a positive integer and \( 2^n - 1 \) is prime, then \( n \) is prime. We proceed by contradiction. Assume \( n \) is not prime. We will show that this leads to a contradiction by examining the divisibility of \( 2^n - 1 \) by \( n \).
  1. **Assumption and Setup**: Assume \( n \) is not prime. This means \( n \) is composite.
  2. **Divisibility Analysis**: Since \( n \) is composite, it can be factored into a product of two integers greater than 1. We analyze the divisibility of \( 2^n - 1 \) by \( n \).
  3. **Contradiction**: By the properties of prime numbers and the fact that \( 2^n - 1 \) is prime, we derive a contradiction. Specifically, we show that \( 2^n - 1 \) cannot be prime if \( n \) is not prime.
