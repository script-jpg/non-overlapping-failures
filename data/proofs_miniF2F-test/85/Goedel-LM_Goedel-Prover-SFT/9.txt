  We aim to show that if \( n \) is a positive integer and \( 2^n - 1 \) is prime, then \( n \) is prime. We will use a proof by contradiction. Assume \( n \) is not prime. Then there exists a number \( k \) such that \( 0 < k < n \). We will show that \( 2^n - 1 \) cannot be prime under this assumption.
  1. **Assumption and Setup**: Assume \( n \) is not prime, so there exists \( k \) such that \( 0 < k < n \).
  2. **Prime Check**: Since \( 2^n - 1 \) is prime, we need to check the divisibility of \( 2^n - 1 \) by any number less than \( n \).
  3. **Divisibility Check**: For any \( k \) such that \( 0 < k < n \), we need to check if \( 2^n - 1 \) is divisible by \( k \).
  4. **Contradiction**: If \( 2^n - 1 \) were divisible by any number less than \( n \), it would contradict the assumption that \( 2^n - 1 \) is prime.
  5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, \( n \) must be prime.
