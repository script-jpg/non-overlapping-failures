  To show that if \( n \) is a positive integer and \( 2^n - 1 \) is prime, then \( n \) is prime, we proceed by contradiction. Assume \( n \) is not prime. Then \( n \) can be factored into two smaller positive integers. We will show that the product of these two integers is not prime, contradicting the given condition that \( 2^n - 1 \) is prime.
