  To show that if \( n \) is a positive integer and \( 2^n - 1 \) is prime, then \( n \) is prime, we proceed as follows:
  1. Assume \( n \) is a positive integer and \( 2^n - 1 \) is prime.
  2. We need to show that \( n \) is prime.
  3. We will use a proof by contradiction. Assume \( n \) is not prime.
  4. If \( n \) is not prime, then \( n \) can be factored into a product of two integers greater than 1.
  5. Consider the sequence \( 2^n - 1 \). Since \( 2^n - 1 \) is prime, it cannot be factored into a product of two integers greater than 1.
  6. This leads to a contradiction because if \( n \) is not prime, then \( 2^n - 1 \) cannot be prime.
  7. Therefore, our assumption that \( n \) is not prime must be false, and hence \( n \) is prime.
