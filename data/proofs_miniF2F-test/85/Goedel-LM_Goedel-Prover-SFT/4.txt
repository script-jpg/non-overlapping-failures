  We aim to show that if \( n \) is a positive integer and \( 2^n - 1 \) is prime, then \( n \) is prime. We will proceed by contradiction. Assume \( n \) is not prime. Then \( n \) is composite. By the properties of prime numbers and the binomial theorem, we can derive a contradiction, specifically showing that \( 2^n - 1 \) cannot be prime if \( n \) is not prime.

  -- Since n is not prime, it is composite.
  -- We use the fact that 2^n - 1 is prime and the properties of prime numbers.
  -- By the binomial theorem, we can derive a contradiction.
  have h' := h₁.eq_two_or_odd
  -- Simplify the expression to show the contradiction.
