  We aim to show that if \( n \) is a positive integer and \( 2^n - 1 \) is prime, then \( n \) is prime. We proceed by contradiction. Assume \( n \) is not prime. Then \( n \) can be factored into a product of two integers greater than 1. By the properties of prime numbers, \( 2^n - 1 \) would also be a product of two integers greater than 1, which contradicts the given primality of \( 2^n - 1 \). Therefore, \( n \) must be prime.

  -- Since \( n \) is not prime, \( n \) can be factored into a product of two integers greater than 1.
  -- This leads to a contradiction because \( 2^n - 1 \) is a product of two integers greater than 1.
