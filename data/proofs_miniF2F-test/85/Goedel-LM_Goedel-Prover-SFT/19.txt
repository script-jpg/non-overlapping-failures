  To show that if \( n \) is a positive integer and \( 2^n - 1 \) is prime, then \( n \) is prime, we proceed as follows:
  1. Assume for contradiction that \( n \) is composite.
  2. Since \( n \) is composite, there exists a positive integer \( d \) such that \( d \mid n \) and \( d > 1 \).
  3. Consider the sequence \( 2^k - 1 \) for \( k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots \).
  4. For each \( k \), \( 2^k - 1 \) is a power of 2 minus 1.
  5. By properties of powers and modular arithmetic, \( 2^k - 1 \) is composite for all \( k \geq 2 \).
  6. Specifically, for \( k = n \), \( 2^n - 1 \) is composite because \( 2^n - 1 \) can be factored into smaller integers.
  7. However, since \( 2^n - 1 \) is given to be prime, this leads to a contradiction.
  8. Therefore, \( n \) must be prime.
