  Given a positive integer \( n \) such that \( 2^n - 1 \) is prime, we need to show that \( n \) is also prime. We proceed by considering the contrapositive of the statement: if \( n \) is not prime, then \( 2^n - 1 \) is not prime. This is demonstrated by showing that if \( n \) is not prime, then \( 2^n - 1 \) cannot be prime.

  -- We use the contrapositive approach: if n is not prime, then 2^n - 1 is not prime.
  contrapose! h₁
  -- We know that n is not prime implies n ≥ 4.
  have h₂ : n ≥ 4 := by
    contrapose! h₁
    -- If n < 4, then n can only be 1, 2, or 3.
    interval_cases n <;> decide
  -- Using the fact that n ≥ 4, we can conclude that 2^n - 1 is not prime.
  interval_cases n <;> simp_all (config := {decide := true})
