  We need to show that for positive real numbers \(a, b, c, d\), the inequality \(a^2 / b + b^2 / c + c^2 / d + d^2 / a \geq a + b + c + d\) holds. This can be achieved using the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality. Specifically, we can apply AM-GM to each term in the sum to derive the desired inequality.

  -- Use the AM-GM inequality to show that each term is greater than or equal to the corresponding variable.
  have h₁ : a ^ 2 / b ≥ 2 * a - b := by
    -- Apply the AM-GM inequality to \(a^2 / b\).
    rw [ge_iff_le]
    rw [le_div_iff (by linarith : 0 < b)]
    nlinarith [sq_nonneg (a - b)]
  have h₂ : b ^ 2 / c ≥ 2 * b - c := by
    -- Apply the AM-GM inequality to \(b^2 / c\).
    rw [ge_iff_le]
    rw [le_div_iff (by linarith : 0 < c)]
    nlinarith [sq_nonneg (b - c)]
  have h₃ : c ^ 2 / d ≥ 2 * c - d := by
    -- Apply the AM-GM inequality to \(c^2 / d\).
    rw [ge_iff_le]
    rw [le_div_iff (by linarith : 0 < d)]
    nlinarith [sq_nonneg (c - d)]
  have h₄ : d ^ 2 / a ≥ 2 * d - a := by
    -- Apply the AM-GM inequality to \(d^2 / a\).
    rw [ge_iff_le]
    rw [le_div_iff (by linarith : 0 < a)]
    nlinarith [sq_nonneg (d - a)]
  -- Sum the inequalities to get the final result.
