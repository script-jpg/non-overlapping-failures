  To show that for positive real numbers \(a, b, c, d\), the inequality \(\frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{c^2}{d} + \frac{d^2}{a} \geq a + b + c + d\) holds, we proceed as follows:
  1. **Establish the positivity of each term**: Since \(a, b, c, d\) are positive, we can safely divide by them.
  2. **Simplify the expression**: Clear the denominators by multiplying through by \(abcd\).
  3. **Rewrite the inequality**: Transform the inequality into a form that can be handled by standard algebraic and arithmetic techniques.
  4. **Apply algebraic and arithmetic inequalities**: Use the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative to derive the desired inequality.
