  We need to show that for positive real numbers \(a, b, c, d\), the inequality \(\frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{c^2}{d} + \frac{d^2}{a} \geq a + b + c + d\) holds. This can be derived using the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality. Specifically, we can apply AM-GM to each term in the expression.
  1. For \(\frac{a^2}{b}\), by AM-GM, \(\frac{a^2}{b} \geq 2a - b\).
  2. For \(\frac{b^2}{c}\), by AM-GM, \(\frac{b^2}{c} \geq 2b - c\).
  3. For \(\frac{c^2}{d}\), by AM-GM, \(\frac{c^2}{d} \geq 2c - d\).
  4. For \(\frac{d^2}{a}\), by AM-GM, \(\frac{d^2}{a} \geq 2d - a\).
  Summing these inequalities, we get:
  \[
  \frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{c^2}{d} + \frac{d^2}{a} \geq (2a - b) + (2b - c) + (2c - d) + (2d - a)
  \]
  Simplifying the right-hand side, we obtain:
  \[
  (2a - b) + (2b - c) + (2c - d) + (2d - a) = 2a + 2b + 2c + 2d - (a + b + c + d) = 2(a + b + c + d) - (a + b + c + d) = a + b + c + d
  \]
  Thus, the inequality \(\frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{c^2}{d} + \frac{d^2}{a} \geq a + b + c + d\) holds.
