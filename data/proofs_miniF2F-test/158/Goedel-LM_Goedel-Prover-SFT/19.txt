  We need to show that for positive real numbers \(a, b, c, d\), the inequality \( \frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{c^2}{d} + \frac{d^2}{a} \geq a + b + c + d \) holds. This can be derived using the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality. Specifically, we apply AM-GM to each term in the sum, and then sum the results to get the desired inequality.
