  We need to show that for positive real numbers \(a, b, c, d\), the inequality 
  \[
  \frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{c^2}{d} + \frac{d^2}{a} \geq a + b + c + d
  \]
  holds. This can be derived using the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality. Specifically, we can apply AM-GM to each pair of terms \(\frac{a^2}{b}\), \(\frac{b^2}{c}\), \(\frac{c^2}{d}\), and \(\frac{d^2}{a}\). By doing so, we obtain the desired inequality.

  have h₄ : 0 < d * a := by
    -- Finally, since d and a are positive, their product is positive.

  -- Using the AM-GM inequality, we can derive the desired inequality.
