  To prove the inequality \( \frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{c^2}{d} + \frac{d^2}{a} \geq a + b + c + d \) for positive real numbers \( a, b, c, d \), we can use the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality. Specifically, we will apply the AM-GM inequality to each term in the sum.
  1. For \( \frac{a^2}{b} \):
     \[
     \frac{a^2}{b} \geq 2a - b \quad \text{(by AM-GM)}
     \]
  2. For \( \frac{b^2}{c} \):
     \[
     \frac{b^2}{c} \geq 2b - c \quad \text{(by AM-GM)}
     \]
  3. For \( \frac{c^2}{d} \):
     \[
     \frac{c^2}{d} \geq 2c - d \quad \text{(by AM-GM)}
     \]
  4. For \( \frac{d^2}{a} \):
     \[
     \frac{d^2}{a} \geq 2d - a \quad \text{(by AM-GM)}
     \]
  Adding these inequalities together, we get:
  \[
  \frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{c^2}{d} + \frac{d^2}{a} \geq (2a - b) + (2b - c) + (2c - d) + (2d - a)
  \]
  Simplifying the right-hand side:
  \[
  (2a - b) + (2b - c) + (2c - d) + (2d - a) = 2a - b + 2b - c + 2c - d + 2d - a = 3a + 3b + 3c + 3d - (a + b + c + d) = 3(a + b + c + d) - (a + b + c + d) = 2(a + b + c + d)
  \]
  Thus, we have:
  \[
  \frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{c^2}{d} + \frac{d^2}{a} \geq 2(a + b + c + d)
  \]
  Since \( a, b, c, d \) are positive, we can conclude that:
  \[
  2(a + b + c + d) \geq a + b + c + d
  \]
  Therefore, we have:
  \[
  \frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{c^2}{d} + \frac{d^2}{a} \geq a + b + c + d
  \]
