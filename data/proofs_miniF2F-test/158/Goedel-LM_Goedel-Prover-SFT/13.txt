  We need to show that for positive real numbers \(a, b, c, d\), the inequality \(\frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{c^2}{d} + \frac{d^2}{a} \geq a + b + c + d\) holds. This can be achieved by applying the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality. Specifically, we can use the fact that for any positive numbers \(x, y\), \(\frac{x^2}{y} \geq 2x - y\). By applying this to each term in the sum, we can derive the desired inequality.
