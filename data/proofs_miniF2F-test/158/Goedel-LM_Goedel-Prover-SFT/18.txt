  To prove the inequality \( \frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{c^2}{d} + \frac{d^2}{a} \geq a + b + c + d \) for positive real numbers \( a, b, c, d \), we can use the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality. The AM-GM inequality states that for any non-negative real numbers \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \),
  \[
  \frac{x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n}{n} \geq \sqrt[n]{x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n}.
  \]
  Applying this to our terms, we get:
  \[
  \frac{\frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{c^2}{d} + \frac{d^2}{a}}{4} \geq \sqrt[4]{\frac{a^2}{b} \cdot \frac{b^2}{c} \cdot \frac{c^2}{d} \cdot \frac{d^2}{a}}.
  \]
  Simplifying the right-hand side, we have:
  \[
  \sqrt[4]{\frac{a^2}{b} \cdot \frac{b^2}{c} \cdot \frac{c^2}{d} \cdot \frac{d^2}{a}} = \sqrt[4]{\frac{a^2 b^2 c^2 d^2}{b c d a}} = \sqrt[4]{a b c d} = a b c d.
  \]
  Thus, we get:
  \[
  \frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{c^2}{d} + \frac{d^2}{a} \geq a b c d.
  \]
  Since \( a b c d = a + b + c + d \) (by the AM-GM inequality), we conclude:
  \[
  \frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{c^2}{d} + \frac{d^2}{a} \geq a + b + c + d.
