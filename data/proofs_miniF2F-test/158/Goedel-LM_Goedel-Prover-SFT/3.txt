  We need to show that for positive real numbers \(a, b, c, d\), the inequality \( \frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{c^2}{d} + \frac{d^2}{a} \geq a + b + c + d \) holds.
  To prove this, we use the fact that for any positive real numbers \(x\) and \(y\), the inequality \( \frac{x^2}{y} \geq 2x - y \) holds. This can be derived from the non-negativity of the square of the difference \(x - y\).
