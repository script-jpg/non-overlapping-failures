  We need to show that for positive real numbers \(a, b, c, d\), the inequality \( \frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{c^2}{d} + \frac{d^2}{a} \geq a + b + c + d \) holds. This can be achieved by applying the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality to each term individually and then summing the results.

  -- Use the fact that each term is positive to apply the AM-GM inequality
  have h₁ : 0 < a * b := mul_pos h₀.1 h₀.2.1
  have h₂ : 0 < b * c := mul_pos h₀.2.1 h₀.2.2.1
  have h₃ : 0 < c * d := mul_pos h₀.2.2.1 h₀.2.2.2
  have h₄ : 0 < d * a := mul_pos h₀.2.2.2 h₀.1
  -- Use the fact that each term is positive to apply the AM-GM inequality
  have h₅ : 0 < a * b * c := mul_pos h₁ h₀.2.2.1
  have h₆ : 0 < b * c * d := mul_pos h₂ h₀.2.2.2
  have h₇ : 0 < c * d * a := mul_pos h₃ h₀.1
  have h₈ : 0 < d * a * b := mul_pos h₄ h₀.2.1
  -- Apply the AM-GM inequality to each term and sum the results
  have h₉ : a ^ 2 / b ≥ 2 * a - b := by

    exact by
      rw [le_div_iff h₀.1]
      nlinarith [sq_nonneg (a - b)]
