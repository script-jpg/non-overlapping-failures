  We need to show that for positive real numbers \(a, b, c, d\), the inequality \(\frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{c^2}{d} + \frac{d^2}{a} \geq a + b + c + d\) holds. This can be derived using the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality. Specifically, we apply AM-GM to the terms \(\frac{a^2}{b}, \frac{b^2}{c}, \frac{c^2}{d}, \frac{d^2}{a}\) and their sum.
