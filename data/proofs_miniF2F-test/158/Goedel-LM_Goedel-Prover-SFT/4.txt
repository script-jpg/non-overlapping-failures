  We need to show that for positive real numbers \(a, b, c, d\), the inequality \( \frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{c^2}{d} + \frac{d^2}{a} \geq a + b + c + d \) holds. This can be derived using the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality. Specifically, we will apply AM-GM to each term in the sum.
  1. **AM-GM Application**: For each term \( \frac{a^2}{b}, \frac{b^2}{c}, \frac{c^2}{d}, \frac{d^2}{a} \), we apply the AM-GM inequality to get:
     \[
     \frac{a^2}{b} \geq 2a - b
     \]
     \[
     \frac{b^2}{c} \geq 2b - c
     \]
     \[
     \frac{c^2}{d} \geq 2c - d
     \]
     \[
     \frac{d^2}{a} \geq 2d - a
     \]
  2. **Summing the Inequalities**: Adding these inequalities together, we get:
     \[
     \frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{c^2}{d} + \frac{d^2}{a} \geq (2a - b) + (2b - c) + (2c - d) + (2d - a)
     \]
  3. **Simplifying the Right-Hand Side**: Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:
     \[
     (2a - b) + (2b - c) + (2c - d) + (2d - a) = 2a - b + 2b - c + 2c - d + 2d - a = a + b + c + d
     \]
  Thus, we have shown that:
  \[
  \frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{c^2}{d} + \frac{d^2}{a} \geq a + b + c + d
  \]
