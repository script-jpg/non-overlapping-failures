  We need to show that for positive real numbers \(a, b, c, d\), the inequality \( \frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{c^2}{d} + \frac{d^2}{a} \geq a + b + c + d \) holds.
  To prove this, we use the fact that for any positive real numbers \(x\) and \(y\), the inequality \( \frac{x^2}{y} \geq 2x - y \) holds. This can be derived from the AM-GM inequality, which states that for any non-negative real numbers \(x\) and \(y\), \( \frac{x + y}{2} \geq \sqrt{xy} \). Squaring both sides of this inequality, we get \( \left( \frac{x + y}{2} \right)^2 \geq xy \), which simplifies to \( \frac{x^2 + 2xy + y^2}{4} \geq xy \). Multiplying both sides by 4, we obtain \( x^2 + 2xy + y^2 \geq 4xy \), which simplifies to \( x^2 + y^2 \geq 2xy \). Rearranging this inequality, we get \( \frac{x^2}{y} \geq 2x - y \).
  Applying this result to each term in the original expression, we get:
  \[ \frac{a^2}{b} \geq 2a - b \]
  \[ \frac{b^2}{c} \geq 2b - c \]
  \[ \frac{c^2}{d} \geq 2c - d \]
  \[ \frac{d^2}{a} \geq 2d - a \]
  Adding these inequalities together, we obtain:
  \[ \frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{c^2}{d} + \frac{d^2}{a} \geq (2a - b) + (2b - c) + (2c - d) + (2d - a) \]
  Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:
  \[ (2a - b) + (2b - c) + (2c - d) + (2d - a) = 4a + 4b + 4c + 4d - (a + b + c + d) = 3a + 3b + 3c + 3d \]
  Since \(a, b, c, d\) are positive, we know that \(3a + 3b + 3c + 3d \geq a + b + c + d\). Therefore, we have:
  \[ \frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{c^2}{d} + \frac{d^2}{a} \geq a + b + c + d \]
