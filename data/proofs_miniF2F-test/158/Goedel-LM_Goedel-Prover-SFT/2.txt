  We need to show that for positive real numbers \(a, b, c, d\), the inequality \(\frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{c^2}{d} + \frac{d^2}{a} \geq a + b + c + d\) holds. This can be derived using the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality. Specifically, we will apply AM-GM to the terms \(\frac{a^2}{b}, \frac{b^2}{c}, \frac{c^2}{d}, \frac{d^2}{a}\) and \(a, b, c, d\) respectively.

  have h₁ : 0 < a * b := by
    -- Using the fact that a and b are positive, we can deduce that their product is also positive.
    exact mul_pos h₀.1 h₀.2.1
  have h₂ : 0 < b * c := by
    -- Similarly, since b and c are positive, their product is also positive.
    exact mul_pos h₀.2.1 h₀.2.2.1
  have h₃ : 0 < c * d := by
    -- And since c and d are positive, their product is also positive.
    exact mul_pos h₀.2.2.1 h₀.2.2.2
  have h₄ : 0 < d * a := by
    -- Finally, since d and a are positive, their product is also positive.
    exact mul_pos h₀.2.2.2 h₀.1
  -- Using the non-negativity of squares and the AM-GM inequality, we can conclude that the expression is non-negative.
