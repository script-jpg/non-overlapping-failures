  To show that for positive real numbers \(a, b, c, d\), the inequality \( \frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{c^2}{d} + \frac{d^2}{a} \geq a + b + c + d \) holds, we can use the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality. Specifically, we will apply AM-GM to each term in the expression and then sum the results to show the desired inequality.
  1. For each term \( \frac{a^2}{b} \), \( \frac{b^2}{c} \), \( \frac{c^2}{d} \), and \( \frac{d^2}{a} \), we apply AM-GM to get \( \frac{a^2}{b} \geq \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2b} \), \( \frac{b^2}{c} \geq \frac{b^2 + c^2}{2c} \), \( \frac{c^2}{d} \geq \frac{c^2 + d^2}{2d} \), and \( \frac{d^2}{a} \geq \frac{d^2 + a^2}{2a} \).
  2. Summing these inequalities, we get:
     \[
     \frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{c^2}{d} + \frac{d^2}{a} \geq \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2b} + \frac{b^2 + c^2}{2c} + \frac{c^2 + d^2}{2d} + \frac{d^2 + a^2}{2a}
     \]
  3. Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:
     \[
     \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2b} + \frac{b^2 + c^2}{2c} + \frac{c^2 + d^2}{2d} + \frac{d^2 + a^2}{2a} = \frac{a^2 + b^2 + b^2 + c^2 + c^2 + d^2 + d^2 + a^2}{2b + 2c + 2d + 2a} = \frac{2a^2 + 2b^2 + 2c^2 + 2d^2}{2(a + b + c + d)} = \frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2}{a + b + c + d}
     \]
  4. Since \(a, b, c, d\) are positive, we can further simplify to:
     \[
     \frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2}{a + b + c + d} \geq a + b + c + d
     \]
  Thus, we have shown that \( \frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{c^2}{d} + \frac{d^2}{a} \geq a + b + c + d \).
