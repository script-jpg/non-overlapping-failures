  We need to show that for positive real numbers \(a, b, c, d\), the inequality \( \frac{a^2}{b} + \frac{b^2}{c} + \frac{c^2}{d} + \frac{d^2}{a} \geq a + b + c + d \) holds. This can be derived using the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality. Specifically, we apply AM-GM to each term in the expression, ensuring that each term is positive. The sum of the squares of the terms divided by their respective terms is greater than or equal to the sum of the terms.
