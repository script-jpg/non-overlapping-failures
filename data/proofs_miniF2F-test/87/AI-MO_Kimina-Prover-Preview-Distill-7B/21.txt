-- The general approach is to factor out the smallest power of 2 in both the numerator and denominator.
  -- The smallest power of 2 in the numerator is 2^2012.
  have h1 : (2 : ℝ) ^ 2012 * (2 ^ 2 + 1) = 2 ^ 2014 + 2 ^ 2012 := by ring
  have h2 : (2 : ℝ) ^ 2012 * (2 ^ 2 - 1) = 2 ^ 2014 - 2 ^ 2012 := by ring

  -- We rewrite the division as a division of products, then separate the division of the products.
  rw [h1, h2, mul_div_mul_right]

  -- The result follows from an arithmetic calculation.
