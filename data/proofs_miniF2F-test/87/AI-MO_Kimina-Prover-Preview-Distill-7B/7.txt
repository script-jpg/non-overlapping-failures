  -- The Lean proof is complicated because it has to deal with the well-definedness of the division.
  -- In other words, it has to prove that the denominator is not zero.
  -- (But this is trivial, because, for example, any power of 2 is positive, and thus 2^2012 > 0, and thus
  -- 2^2012 * (2^2 - 1) > 0, so 2^2012 * (2^2 - 1) ≠ 0.)
