The Lean proof is remarkably concise because Lean's computational capabilities can handle arithmetic expressions involving large powers directly. Let's break down what Lean is doing behind the scenes:

1. The theorem states that $(2^{2014} + 2^{2012}) / (2^{2014} - 2^{2012}) = 5/3$ as real numbers.

2. Lean's `norm_num` tactic is powerful enough to compute with concrete numerical values. Even though $2^{2014}$ and $2^{2012}$ are enormous numbers, Lean can work with them symbolically.

3. Notice that both the numerator and denominator have a common factor of $2^{2012}$. We can factor this out:
   - Numerator: $2^{2014} + 2^{2012} = 2^{2012}(2^2 + 1) = 2^{2012} \cdot 5$
   - Denominator: $2^{2014} - 2^{2012} = 2^{2012}(2^2 - 1) = 2^{2012} \cdot 3$

4. So the expression becomes $(2^{2012} \cdot 5) / (2^{2012} \cdot 3) = 5/3$.

5. Lean's `norm_num` tactic can perform these algebraic simplifications automatically. It will:
   - Recognize the common factor of $2^{2012}$ in both the numerator and denominator
   - Cancel the common factor
   - Compute $5/3$ as the final result

6. Lean verifies that this equality holds for real numbers, as specified in the theorem statement.

Therefore, the value of the expression is indeed $\frac{5}{3}$, confirming that the answer is (C).
