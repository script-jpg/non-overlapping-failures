  To solve the problem of finding the value of \(\frac{2^{2014} + 2^{2012}}{2^{2014} - 2^{2012}}\), we start by expressing the numerator and the denominator in a common form. Notice that \(2^{2014}\) can be written as \(2^2 \cdot 2^{2012}\). Thus, we have:
  \[
  \frac{2^{2014} + 2^{2012}}{2^{2014} - 2^{2012}} = \frac{2^2 \cdot 2^{2012} + 2^{2012}}{2^2 \cdot 2^{2012} - 2^{2012}}
  \]
  Next, we factor out \(2^{2012}\) from both the numerator and the denominator:
  \[
  \frac{(2^2 + 1) \cdot 2^{2012}}{(2^2 - 1) \cdot 2^{2012}}
  \]
  Since \(2^{2012}\) is non-zero, we can cancel it out from both the numerator and the denominator:
  \[
  \frac{2^2 + 1}{2^2 - 1}
  \]
  Simplifying the expressions inside the fraction, we get:
  \[
  \frac{4 + 1}{4 - 1} = \frac{5}{3}
  \]
  Thus, the value of the given expression is \(\frac{5}{3}\).
