  To solve the problem of finding the value of \(\frac{2^{2014} + 2^{2012}}{2^{2014} - 2^{2012}}\), we start by simplifying the expression using properties of exponents and algebraic manipulation.
  First, we note that \(2^{2014}\) and \(2^{2012}\) can be factored as \(2^{2012}(2^2 + 1)\). This allows us to rewrite the numerator and the denominator.
  Next, we simplify the fraction by canceling out common terms. Since \(2^{2012}\) is a common factor in both the numerator and the denominator, we can cancel it out.
  Finally, we simplify the resulting expression to obtain \(\frac{5}{3}\).
