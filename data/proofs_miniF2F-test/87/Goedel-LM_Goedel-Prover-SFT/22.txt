  To solve the problem of finding the value of \(\frac{2^{2014} + 2^{2012}}{2^{2014} - 2^{2012}}\), we start by expressing the numerator and the denominator in terms of powers of 2. We can factor out \(2^{2012}\) from both the numerator and the denominator:
  \[
  \frac{2^{2014} + 2^{2012}}{2^{2014} - 2^{2012}} = \frac{2^{2012} \cdot (2^2 + 1)}{2^{2012} \cdot (2^2 - 1)}
  \]
  Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses:
  \[
  2^2 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5
  \]
  \[
  2^2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3
  \]
  Thus, the expression becomes:
  \[
  \frac{2^{2012} \cdot 5}{2^{2012} \cdot 3} = \frac{5}{3}
  \]
  Therefore, the value of the given expression is \(\frac{5}{3}\).

  -- We use norm_num to simplify the expression.
  -- First, we show that 2^2014 and 2^2012 are not equal to 0 to avoid division by zero.
  norm_num [show (2 : ℝ) ^ 2014 ≠ 0 by norm_num [show (2 : ℝ) ^ 2012 ≠ 0 by norm_num],
    show (2 : ℝ) ^ 2012 ≠ 0 by norm_num]
