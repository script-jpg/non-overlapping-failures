  To solve the problem, we start by simplifying the expression \(\frac{2^{2014} + 2^{2012}}{2^{2014} - 2^{2012}}\). We can factor out the common term \(2^{2012}\) from both the numerator and the denominator. This gives us:
  \[
  \frac{2^{2012} \cdot (2^2 + 1)}{2^{2012} \cdot (2^2 - 1)}
  \]
  Simplifying the terms inside the parentheses, we get:
  \[
  \frac{2^{2012} \cdot 5}{2^{2012} \cdot 3}
  \]
  Since \(2^{2012}\) is non-zero (as \(2^{2012} = 2^{2012}\)), we can cancel it out from both the numerator and the denominator:
  \[
  \frac{5}{3}
  \]
  Thus, the value of the expression is \(\frac{5}{3}\).
