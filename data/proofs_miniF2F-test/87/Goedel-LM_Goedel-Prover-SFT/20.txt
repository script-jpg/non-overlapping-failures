  To solve the problem of finding the value of \(\frac{2^{2014} + 2^{2012}}{2^{2014} - 2^{2012}}\), we start by simplifying the expression. We can factor out \(2^{2012}\) from both the numerator and the denominator. This gives us:
  \[
  \frac{2^{2014} + 2^{2012}}{2^{2014} - 2^{2012}} = \frac{2^{2012} \cdot (2^2 + 1)}{2^{2012} \cdot (2^2 - 1)}
  \]
  Next, we simplify the terms inside the parentheses:
  \[
  2^2 = 4
  \]
  Thus, the expression becomes:
  \[
  \frac{2^{2012} \cdot (4 + 1)}{2^{2012} \cdot (4 - 1)} = \frac{2^{2012} \cdot 5}{2^{2012} \cdot 3}
  \]
  Canceling \(2^{2012}\) from both the numerator and the denominator, we get:
  \[
  \frac{5}{3}
  \]
  Therefore, the value of the given expression is \(\frac{5}{3}\).
