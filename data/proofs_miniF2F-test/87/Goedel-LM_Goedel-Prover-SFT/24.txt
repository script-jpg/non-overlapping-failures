  To solve the problem, we start by expressing the given fraction in a more manageable form. We can factor out \(2^{2012}\) from both the numerator and the denominator:
  \[
  \frac{2^{2014} + 2^{2012}}{2^{2014} - 2^{2012}} = \frac{2^{2012} \cdot (2^2 + 1)}{2^{2012} \cdot (2^2 - 1)}
  \]
  Next, we simplify the expressions inside the parentheses:
  \[
  2^2 + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5
  \]
  \[
  2^2 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3
  \]
  Thus, the fraction becomes:
  \[
  \frac{2^{2012} \cdot 5}{2^{2012} \cdot 3} = \frac{5}{3}
  \]
  This completes the proof.
