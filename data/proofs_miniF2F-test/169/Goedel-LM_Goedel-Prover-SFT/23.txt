  Given real numbers \( x \) and \( y \) with an arithmetic mean of 7 and a geometric mean of \( \sqrt{19} \), we need to find \( x^2 + y^2 \) and show that it equals 158.
  1. From the arithmetic mean condition, we have:
     \[
     \frac{x + y}{2} = 7 \implies x + y = 14
     \]
  2. From the geometric mean condition, we have:
     \[
     \sqrt{x \cdot y} = \sqrt{19} \implies x \cdot y = 19
     \]
  3. We need to express \( x^2 + y^2 \) in terms of \( x + y \) and \( x \cdot y \):
     \[
     x^2 + y^2 = (x + y)^2 - 2 \cdot (x \cdot y)
     \]
  4. Substituting the known values:
     \[
     x^2 + y^2 = 14^2 - 2 \cdot 19 = 196 - 38 = 158
     \]
  Thus, the value of \( x^2 + y^2 \) is 158.
