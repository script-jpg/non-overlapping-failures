  Given real numbers \( x \) and \( y \) with an arithmetic mean of 7 and a geometric mean of \( \sqrt{19} \), we need to find \( x^2 + y^2 \) and show that it equals 158.
  1. From the arithmetic mean, we have:
     \[
     \frac{x + y}{2} = 7 \implies x + y = 14
     \]
  2. From the geometric mean, we have:
     \[
     \sqrt{xy} = \sqrt{19} \implies xy = 19
     \]
  3. We need to find \( x^2 + y^2 \). Using the identity:
     \[
     (x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2
     \]
     Substituting the known values:
     \[
     14^2 = x^2 + 2 \cdot 19 + y^2 \implies 196 = x^2 + 38 + y^2 \implies x^2 + y^2 = 158
     \]
