  Given real numbers \( x \) and \( y \) with an arithmetic mean of 7 and a geometric mean of \( \sqrt{19} \), we need to find \( x^2 + y^2 \) and show that it equals 158.
  1. From the arithmetic mean condition, we have:
     \[
     \frac{x + y}{2} = 7 \implies x + y = 14
     \]
  2. From the geometric mean condition, we have:
     \[
     \sqrt{x \cdot y} = \sqrt{19} \implies x \cdot y = 19
     \]
  3. We need to find \( x^2 + y^2 \). Using the identity:
     \[
     (x + y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy
     \]
  4. Substitute \( x + y = 14 \) and \( x \cdot y = 19 \):
     \[
     14^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2 \cdot 19
     \]
  5. Calculate \( 14^2 \):
     \[
     14^2 = 196
     \]
  6. Substitute \( 2 \cdot 19 = 38 \):
     \[
     196 = x^2 + y^2 + 38
     \]
  7. Solve for \( x^2 + y^2 \):
     \[
     x^2 + y^2 = 196 - 38 = 158
     \]
