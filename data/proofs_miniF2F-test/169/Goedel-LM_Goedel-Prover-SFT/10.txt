  Given real numbers \( x \) and \( y \) with an arithmetic mean of 7 and a geometric mean of \( \sqrt{19} \), we need to find \( x^2 + y^2 \).
  First, we use the arithmetic mean condition:
  \[
  \frac{x + y}{2} = 7 \implies x + y = 14
  \]
  Next, we use the geometric mean condition:
  \[
  \sqrt{xy} = \sqrt{19} \implies xy = 19
  \]
  To find \( x^2 + y^2 \), we use the identity:
  \[
  (x + y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy
  \]
  Substituting the known values:
  \[
  14^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2 \cdot 19
  \]
  \[
  196 = x^2 + y^2 + 38
  \]
  Solving for \( x^2 + y^2 \):
  \[
  x^2 + y^2 = 196 - 38 = 158
  \]
  Thus, the value of \( x^2 + y^2 \) is 158.
