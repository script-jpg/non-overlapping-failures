-- First, we try to understand the problem. We have:
  -- 1. (x + y) / 2 = 7 (arithmetic mean)
  -- 2. √(x * y) = √19 (geometric mean)
  -- We need to find x² + y²

  -- Let's start by importing the necessary libraries and setting up the theorem statement:

  import Mathlib
  import Aesop

  open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat

  -- Now, let's define the theorem with the given conditions:

  theorem mathd_algebra_332 (x y : ℝ) (h₀ : (x + y) / 2 = 7) (h₁ : Real.sqrt (x * y) = Real.sqrt 19) :
      x ^ 2 + y ^ 2 = 158 := by

    -- From h₀, we know that (x + y) / 2 = 7, which means x + y = 14
    have h2 : x + y = 14 := by linarith

    -- From h₁, we have √(x * y) = √19. Since the square root function is injective for non-negative numbers,
    -- we can conclude that x * y = 19
    have h3 : x * y = 19 := by
      have h3 : x * y = 19 := by
        have h4 : x * y ≥ 0 := by nlinarith [sq_nonneg (x - y), sq_nonneg (x + y - 14)]
        have h5 : x * y ≥ 0 := by nlinarith
        have h6 : Real.sqrt (x * y) = Real.sqrt 19 := h₁
        have h7 : x * y = 19 := by
          apply Real.sqrt_inj (by nlinarith) (by nlinarith) |>.mp h6
        exact h7
      exact h3

    -- Now we need to find x² + y². We can use the identity:
    -- x² + y² = (x + y)² - 2xy
    have h4 : x^2 + y^2 = (x + y) ^ 2 - 2 * (x * y) := by
      ring

    -- Substituting the values we know:
    -- x + y = 14, so (x + y)² = 14² = 196
    -- x * y = 19
    -- So x² + y² = 196 - 2 * 19 = 196 - 38 = 158
