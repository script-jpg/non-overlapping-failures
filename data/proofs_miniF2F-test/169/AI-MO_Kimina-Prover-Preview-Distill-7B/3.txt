-- First, we need to find the value of $x^2 + y^2$ given the arithmetic mean is 7
  -- and geometric mean is $\sqrt{19}$.

  -- We know that $(x + y) / 2 = 7$, so $x + y = 14$.
  have h2 : x + y = 14 := by linarith only [h₀]

  -- We also know that $\sqrt{x \cdot y} = \sqrt{19}$, so $x \cdot y = 19$.
  have h3 : x * y = 19 := by
    have := Real.sqrt_inj (by nlinarith) (by nlinarith) h₁
    linarith only [this]

  -- Now, we can use the identity $(x + y)^2 = x^2 + 2xy + y^2$ to find $x^2 + y^2$.
  -- We have $(x + y)^2 = 14^2 = 196$ and $2xy = 2 \cdot 19 = 38$.
  -- So $x^2 + y^2 = (x + y)^2 - 2xy = 196 - 38 = 158$.
