-- First, let's understand what we're given:
  -- - The arithmetic mean of $x$ and $y$ is 7: $(x + y) / 2 = 7$
  -- - The geometric mean of $x$ and $y$ is $\sqrt{19}$: $\sqrt{x \cdot y} = \sqrt{19}$

  -- From the arithmetic mean, we can derive that $x + y = 14$.
  have h2 : x + y = 14 := by linarith

  -- From the geometric mean, we can derive that $x \cdot y = 19$.
  have h3 : x * y = 19 := by
    have g1 : x * y = 19 := by
      rw [Real.sqrt_inj (by positivity) (by positivity)] at h₁
      exact h₁
    exact g1

  -- To find $x^2 + y^2$, we can use the identity: $x^2 + y^2 = (x + y)^2 - 2xy$
  have h4 : x ^ 2 + y ^ 2 = (x + y) ^ 2 - 2 * (x * y) := by
    ring

  -- Substituting the values we have:
  -- $x^2 + y^2 = (14)^2 - 2 \cdot (19) = 196 - 38 = 158$
