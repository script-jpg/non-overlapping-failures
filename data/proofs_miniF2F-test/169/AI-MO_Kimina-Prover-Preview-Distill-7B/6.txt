-- First, we try to understand the problem and plan our approach.
  -- We have two conditions: the arithmetic mean is 7, and the geometric mean is √19.
  -- We need to find x² + y².

  -- The arithmetic mean condition tells us that (x + y) / 2 = 7, which means x + y = 14.
  have h2 : x + y = 14 := by linarith

  -- The geometric mean condition is √(x * y) = √19. Since the square root function is injective for non-negative numbers,
  -- this implies x * y = 19.
  have h3 : x * y = 19 := by
    have h3 : x * y = 19 := by
      rw [Real.sqrt_inj (by nlinarith) (by nlinarith)] at h₁
      exact h₁
    exact h3

  -- Now, we need to find x² + y². We can use the identity: x² + y² = (x + y)² - 2xy
  -- Substituting the values we have:
  -- x² + y² = (14)² - 2(19) = 196 - 38 = 158
  have h4 : x ^ 2 + y ^ 2 = (x + y) ^ 2 - 2 * (x * y) := by
    ring

  -- Let's substitute the known values into this equation.
  rw [h2, h3] at h4

  -- Simplify the expression to compute the final answer.
