-- First, we try to understand the problem.
  -- We're given that: $(x + y) / 2 = 7$ which means $x + y = 14$.
  have h₂ : x + y = 14 := by linarith only [h₀]

  -- We're also given that $\sqrt{x \cdot y} = \sqrt{19}$, which means $x \cdot y = 19$.
  have h₃ : x * y = 19 := by
    rw [Real.sqrt_inj (by nlinarith) (by nlinarith)] at h₁
    exact h₁

  -- We need to find $x^2 + y^2$.
  -- Recall that $x^2 + y^2 = (x + y)^2 - 2xy$.
  have h₄ : x ^ 2 + y ^ 2 = (x + y) ^ 2 - 2 * (x * y) := by ring

  -- Now, we can substitute the values we found into this equation.
  -- $(x + y) = 14$ and $xy = 19$.
  rw [h₄, h₂, h₃]

  -- So, $x^2 + y^2 = 14^2 - 2 \cdot 19 = 196 - 38 = 158$.
