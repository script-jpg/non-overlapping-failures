-- First, we try to understand what we're given and what we need to prove.
  -- We have:
  -- 1. (x + y) / 2 = 7 (arithmetic mean)
  -- 2. √(x * y) = √19 (geometric mean)
  -- And we need to prove that x² + y² = 158

  -- Let's begin by importing the necessary libraries and setting up the theorem statement:

  import Mathlib
  import Aesop

  open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat

  -- Now, let's state the theorem with the given conditions and the goal:

  theorem mathd_algebra_332 (x y : ℝ) (h₀ : (x + y) / 2 = 7) (h₁ : Real.sqrt (x * y) = Real.sqrt 19) :
      x ^ 2 + y ^ 2 = 158 := by

  -- From (x + y) / 2 = 7, we can derive that x + y = 14
  have h2 : x + y = 14 := by linarith

  -- From √(x * y) = √19, we can derive that x * y = 19, provided that x * y ≥ 0
  have h3 : x * y = 19 := by
    have h3 : x * y ≥ 0 := by
      have h3 : Real.sqrt (x * y) = Real.sqrt 19 := h₁
      have h4 : 0 ≤ Real.sqrt 19 := Real.sqrt_nonneg 19
      have h5 : 0 ≤ Real.sqrt (x * y) := Real.sqrt_nonneg (x * y)
      have h6 : Real.sqrt (x * y) = Real.sqrt 19 := h₁
      have h7 : x * y = 19 := by
        have h7 : (Real.sqrt (x * y)) ^ 2 = (Real.sqrt 19) ^ 2 := by rw [h6]
        rw [Real.sq_sqrt (by linarith)] at h7
        rw [Real.sq_sqrt (by norm_num)] at h7
        linarith
      linarith
    have h4 : x * y = 19 := by
      have h4 : Real.sqrt (x * y) = Real.sqrt 19 := h₁
      have h5 : (Real.sqrt (x * y)) ^ 2 = (Real.sqrt 19) ^ 2 := by rw [h4]
      rw [Real.sq_sqrt (by linarith)] at h5
      rw [Real.sq_sqrt (by norm_num)] at h5

  -- We know that (x + y)² = x² + 2xy + y²
  have h4 : (x + y) ^ 2 = x ^ 2 + 2 * (x * y) + y ^ 2 := by ring

  -- Substituting the values we know into this equation:
  -- (x + y)² = 14² = 196
  -- 2xy = 2 * 19 = 38
  -- So x² + y² = (x + y)² - 2xy = 196 - 38 = 158
  have h5 : (x + y) ^ 2 = 196 := by
    have h5 : (x + y) = 14 := h2
    linarith
  have h6 : 2 * (x * y) = 38 := by
    have h6 : x * y = 19 := h3
    linarith
  linarith

  -- Therefore, x² + y² = 158, which is our final answer

  -- The key insight was that we didn't need to solve for x and y individually.
  -- Instead, we used the given constraints on their arithmetic and geometric means
  -- to directly compute x² + y².

  -- This approach demonstrates the power of algebraic manipulation and the
  -- importance of recognizing how different expressions relate to each other.
  -- By working with the constraints provided, we could solve the problem efficiently.
