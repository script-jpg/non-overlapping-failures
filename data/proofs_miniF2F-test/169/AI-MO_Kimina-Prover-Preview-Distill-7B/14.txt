-- first prove that x * y = 19, to do this, i need to get rid of the `Real.sqrt`
  have h₂ : x * y = 19 := by
    rw [Real.sqrt_inj (by apply mul_nonneg <;> linarith) (by norm_num)] at h₁
    exact h₁

  -- next, get the expanded form of $(x + y)^2$, to do this, i need to get rid of the divisions
  have h₃ : (x + y) ^ 2 = 4 * (x * y) := by
    rw [add_div]
    ring_nf
    linarith

  -- finally, substitute the values to get the final answer
  rw [h₀, h₂] at h₃
  ring_nf at h₃
  linarith
