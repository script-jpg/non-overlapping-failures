-- The arithmetic mean of $x$ and $y$ is 7
  -- The geometric mean of $x$ and $y$ is $\sqrt{19}$

  -- We need to find $x^2 + y^2$

  -- First, I need to think about the strategy. We have:
  -- 1. $x + y = 14$ (from the arithmetic mean)
  -- 2. $x \cdot y = 19$ (from the geometric mean)
  -- And we need to find $x^2 + y^2$

  -- Using the identity: $x^2 + y^2 = (x + y)^2 - 2xy$, we can substitute:
  -- $x^2 + y^2 = 14^2 - 2 \cdot 19 = 196 - 38 = 158$

  have h2 : x + y = 14 := by linarith
  have h3 : x * y = 19 := by
