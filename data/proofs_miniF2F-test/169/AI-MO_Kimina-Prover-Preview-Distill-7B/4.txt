-- First, we try to understand the problem. We have:
  -- 1. (x + y) / 2 = 7 (arithmetic mean)
  -- 2. sqrt(x * y) = sqrt(19) (geometric mean)
  -- And we need to find x^2 + y^2.

  -- Let's start by importing the necessary libraries and setting up the theorem statement:

  -- Now, let's formulate the theorem:

  theorem mathd_algebra_332 (x y : ℝ) (h₀ : (x + y) / 2 = 7) (h₁ : Real.sqrt (x * y) = Real.sqrt 19) :
      x ^ 2 + y ^ 2 = 158 := by

    -- From (x + y) / 2 = 7, we can derive that x + y = 14
    have h2 : x + y = 14 := by linarith

    -- From sqrt(x * y) = sqrt(19), we can derive that x * y = 19
    have h3 : x * y = 19 := by
      have g1 : 0 ≤ x * y := by
        nlinarith [sq_nonneg (x - y), sq_nonneg (x + y)]
      have g2 : 0 ≤ (19 : ℝ) := by norm_num
      have h3 : x * y = 19 := by
        apply (Real.sqrt_eq sqrt 19).mp h₁
        simp [g1, g2]
      exact h3
```

  So now we have:
  1. x + y = 14
  2. x * y = 19

  To find x^2 + y^2, we can use the identity:
  x^2 + y^2 = (x + y)^2 - 2xy

  Let's complete the proof:

```tactics
have h4 : x^2 + y^2 = (x + y) ^ 2 - 2 * (x * y) := by
  ring
```

  This establishes the identity x^2 + y^2 = (x + y)^2 - 2xy. The `ring` tactic is powerful for proving algebraic identities like this.

Now we can substitute the values we know:

```tactics
rw [h4, h2, h3]
norm_num
```

  After substitution, we get:
  x^2 + y^2 = 14^2 - 2 * 19 = 196 - 38 = 158

  The `norm_num` tactic calculates this arithmetic expression to get the final answer of 158.

Therefore, x^2 + y^2 = 158.
