  Given three consecutive positive integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(b = a + 1\) and \(c = b + 1\), and the product of these integers equals 8 times their sum, we need to show that the sum of their squares is 77.
  First, we express \(b\) and \(c\) in terms of \(a\):
  \[ b = a + 1 \]
  \[ c = b + 1 = a + 2 \]
  Next, we substitute these expressions into the given equation:
  \[ a \cdot (a + 1) \cdot (a + 2) = 8 \cdot (a + (a + 1) + (a + 2)) \]
  Simplifying the left-hand side:
  \[ a^3 + 3a^2 + 2a = 8 \cdot (3a + 3) \]
  \[ a^3 + 3a^2 + 2a = 24a + 24 \]
  Rearranging terms:
  \[ a^3 + 3a^2 + 2a - 24a - 24 = 0 \]
  \[ a^3 + 3a^2 - 22a - 24 = 0 \]
  We solve this equation by finding the roots. By inspection or using the Rational Root Theorem, we find that \(a = 4\) is a root. Substituting \(a = 4\) into the equation:
  \[ 4^3 + 3 \cdot 4^2 - 22 \cdot 4 - 24 = 64 + 48 - 88 - 24 = 0 \]
  Thus, \(a = 4\) is indeed a root. Now, we calculate the sum of the squares of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):
  \[ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 = 16 + 25 + 36 = 77 \]
  Therefore, the sum of the squares of the three consecutive integers is 77.
