  Given three consecutive positive integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(b = a + 1\) and \(c = b + 1\), and their product is \(8\) times their sum, we need to show that the sum of their squares is \(77\).
  First, we substitute \(b\) and \(c\) with \(a + 1\) and \(a + 2\) respectively. This gives us the equation:
  \[ a \cdot (a + 1) \cdot (a + 2) = 8 \cdot (a + (a + 1) + (a + 2)) \]
  Simplifying the left-hand side:
  \[ a \cdot (a + 1) \cdot (a + 2) = a \cdot (a^2 + 3a + 2) = a^3 + 3a^2 + 2a \]
  Simplifying the right-hand side:
  \[ 8 \cdot (3a + 3) = 24a + 24 \]
  Equating both sides:
  \[ a^3 + 3a^2 + 2a = 24a + 24 \]
  Rearranging terms:
  \[ a^3 + 3a^2 + 2a - 24a - 24 = 0 \]
  \[ a^3 + 3a^2 - 22a - 24 = 0 \]
  We solve this polynomial equation by finding the roots. The roots are \(a = 4\), \(a = -2\), and \(a = -1\). Since \(a\) is a positive integer, we discard \(a = -2\) and \(a = -1\). Thus, \(a = 4\).
  Now, we calculate \(b\) and \(c\):
  \[ b = a + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5 \]
  \[ c = a + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \]
  Finally, we compute the sum of the squares:
  \[ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 = 16 + 25 + 36 = 77 \]
  Thus, the sum of the squares is \(77\).
