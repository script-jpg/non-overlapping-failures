  Given three consecutive positive integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(b = a + 1\) and \(c = b + 1\), we are to show that the sum of their squares is 77. We are provided with the equation \(a \cdot b \cdot c = 8 \cdot (a + b + c)\). By substituting the values of \(b\) and \(c\) in terms of \(a\) into the equation and simplifying, we can derive the required result.
