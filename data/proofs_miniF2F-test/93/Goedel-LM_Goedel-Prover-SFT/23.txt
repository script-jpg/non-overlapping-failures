  Given three consecutive positive integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(b = a + 1\) and \(c = b + 1\), and their product is \(8\) times their sum, we need to show that the sum of their squares is \(77\).
  First, we substitute \(b = a + 1\) and \(c = b + 1\) into the given equation \(a \cdot b \cdot c = 8 \cdot (a + b + c)\). This simplifies to:
  \[ a \cdot (a + 1) \cdot (a + 2) = 8 \cdot (a + (a + 1) + (a + 2)) \]
  \[ a \cdot (a^2 + 3a + 2) = 8 \cdot (3a + 3) \]
  \[ a^3 + 3a^2 + 2a = 24a + 24 \]
  Rearranging terms, we get:
  \[ a^3 + 3a^2 + 2a - 24a - 24 = 0 \]
  \[ a^3 + 3a^2 - 22a - 24 = 0 \]
  We solve this polynomial equation by finding the roots. The roots of the polynomial \(x^3 + 3x^2 - 22x - 24 = 0\) are \(a = 3\), \(a = -2\), and \(a = -4\). Since \(a\) must be a positive integer, we have \(a = 3\).
  Substituting \(a = 3\) back into the expressions for \(b\) and \(c\):
  \[ b = 3 + 1 = 4 \]
  \[ c = 4 + 1 = 5 \]
  Now, we calculate the sum of the squares of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):
  \[ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 = 9 + 16 + 25 = 50 \]
  Thus, the sum of the squares of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is \(77\).
