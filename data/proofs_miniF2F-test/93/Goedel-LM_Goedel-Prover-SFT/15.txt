  Given three consecutive positive integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(a \cdot b \cdot c = 8 \cdot (a + b + c)\), we need to show that the sum of their squares is 77.
  1. Substitute \(b = a + 1\) and \(c = b + 1\) into the equation \(a \cdot b \cdot c = 8 \cdot (a + b + c)\).
  2. Simplify the equation using the given relationships.
  3. Solve the resulting equation to find the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).
  4. Calculate the sum of the squares of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) and verify that it equals 77.
