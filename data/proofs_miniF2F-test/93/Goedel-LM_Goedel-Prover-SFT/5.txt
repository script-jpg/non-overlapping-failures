  Given three consecutive positive integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(b = a + 1\) and \(c = b + 1\), and their product equals 8 times their sum, we need to show that the sum of their squares is 77. We start by substituting the values of \(b\) and \(c\) in terms of \(a\) into the given equation. This simplifies the equation to a quadratic form in terms of \(a\). Solving this quadratic equation using algebraic manipulations and arithmetic operations, we find that \(a = 5\). Substituting \(a = 5\) back into the expressions for \(b\) and \(c\), we get \(b = 6\) and \(c = 7\). Finally, we compute the sum of the squares of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) to verify that it equals 77.
