  Given three consecutive positive integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(a + 1 = b\) and \(b + 1 = c\), and their product is equal to 8 times their sum, we need to show that the sum of their squares is 77.
  First, we express \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in terms of each other:
  - \(a = b - 1\)
  - \(b = c - 1\)
  Substituting these into the given equation \(a \cdot b \cdot c = 8 \cdot (a + b + c)\), we get:
  \[
  (b - 1) \cdot b \cdot (b + 1) = 8 \cdot ((b - 1) + b + (b + 1))
  \]
  Simplifying the left-hand side:
  \[
  (b^2 - 1) \cdot b = 8 \cdot (3b)
  \]
  \[
  b^3 - b = 24b
  \]
  \[
  b^3 - 25b = 0
  \]
  \[
  b(b^2 - 25) = 0
  \]
  Since \(b > 0\), we have:
  \[
  b^2 - 25 = 0 \implies b = 5
  \]
  Thus, \(a = 4\) and \(c = 6\). Now, we calculate the sum of their squares:
  \[
  a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 = 16 + 25 + 36 = 77
  \]
