  Given three consecutive positive integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(b = a + 1\) and \(c = b + 1\), and the product of these integers is \(8\) times their sum, we need to show that the sum of their squares is \(77\).
  1. Substitute \(b = a + 1\) and \(c = b + 1\) into the given equation \(a \cdot b \cdot c = 8 \cdot (a + b + c)\).
  2. Simplify the equation to find the value of \(a\).
  3. Use the value of \(a\) to compute \(b\) and \(c\).
  4. Calculate the sum of the squares of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) and verify that it equals \(77\).
