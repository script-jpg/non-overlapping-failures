  Given three consecutive positive integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(b = a + 1\) and \(c = b + 1\), and their product equals 8 times their sum, we need to find the sum of their squares. The condition given is \(a \cdot b \cdot c = 8 \cdot (a + b + c)\).
  First, we express \(b\) and \(c\) in terms of \(a\):
  \[ b = a + 1 \]
  \[ c = a + 2 \]
  Substituting these into the product equation:
  \[ a \cdot (a + 1) \cdot (a + 2) = 8 \cdot (a + (a + 1) + (a + 2)) \]
  Simplifying the right-hand side:
  \[ a \cdot (a + 1) \cdot (a + 2) = 8 \cdot (3a + 3) \]
  \[ a \cdot (a + 1) \cdot (a + 2) = 24a + 24 \]
  Expanding the left-hand side:
  \[ a \cdot (a^2 + 3a + 2) = 24a + 24 \]
  \[ a^3 + 3a^2 + 2a = 24a + 24 \]
  \[ a^3 + 3a^2 - 22a - 24 = 0 \]
  This is a cubic equation. Solving for \(a\) using the Rational Root Theorem, we find that \(a = 4\) is a root. Substituting \(a = 4\) into the equations for \(b\) and \(c\):
  \[ b = 4 + 1 = 5 \]
  \[ c = 4 + 2 = 6 \]
  Now, we calculate the sum of the squares:
  \[ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 = 16 + 25 + 36 = 77 \]
  Thus, the sum of the squares of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is indeed 77.
