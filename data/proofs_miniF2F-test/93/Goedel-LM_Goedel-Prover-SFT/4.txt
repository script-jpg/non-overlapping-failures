  Given three consecutive positive integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(b = a + 1\) and \(c = b + 1\), and their product is \(8\) times their sum, we need to show that the sum of their squares is \(77\).
  1. From the given conditions, we have:
     \[
     a \cdot b \cdot c = 8 \cdot (a + b + c)
     \]
     Substituting \(b = a + 1\) and \(c = b + 1\), we get:
     \[
     a \cdot (a + 1) \cdot (a + 2) = 8 \cdot (a + (a + 1) + (a + 2))
     \]
  2. Simplifying the equation:
     \[
     a \cdot (a + 1) \cdot (a + 2) = 8 \cdot (3a + 3)
     \]
     \[
     a \cdot (a + 1) \cdot (a + 2) = 24a + 24
     \]
  3. Expanding the left-hand side:
     \[
     a \cdot (a + 1) \cdot (a + 2) = a \cdot (a^2 + 3a + 2) = a^3 + 3a^2 + 2a
     \]
  4. Equating both sides:
     \[
     a^3 + 3a^2 + 2a = 24a + 24
     \]
  5. Rearranging terms:
     \[
     a^3 + 3a^2 + 2a - 24a - 24 = 0
     \]
     \[
     a^3 + 3a^2 - 22a - 24 = 0
     \]
  6. Solving the polynomial equation, we find that \(a = 4\) is a solution. Substituting \(a = 4\) into the expressions for \(b\) and \(c\):
     \[
     b = 4 + 1 = 5
     \]
     \[
     c = 5 + 1 = 6
     \]
  7. Calculating the sum of their squares:
     \[
     a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 = 16 + 25 + 36 = 77
     \]
  Thus, the sum of their squares is \(77\).
