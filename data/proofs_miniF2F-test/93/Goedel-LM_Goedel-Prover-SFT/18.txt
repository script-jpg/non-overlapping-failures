  Given three consecutive positive integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(b = a + 1\) and \(c = b + 1\), and their product equals 8 times their sum, we need to show that the sum of their squares is 77.
  First, we express the given condition mathematically:
  \[ a \cdot (a + 1) \cdot (a + 2) = 8 \cdot (a + (a + 1) + (a + 2)) \]
  Simplifying both sides, we get:
  \[ a^3 + 3a^2 + 2a = 8a + 12 \]
  Rearranging terms, we obtain:
  \[ a^3 + 3a^2 + 2a - 8a - 12 = 0 \]
  \[ a^3 + 3a^2 - 6a - 12 = 0 \]
  Next, we solve for \(a\) by testing integer values. We find that \(a = 2\) satisfies the equation:
  \[ 2^3 + 3 \cdot 2^2 - 6 \cdot 2 - 12 = 8 + 12 - 12 - 12 = 0 \]
  Thus, \(a = 2\), \(b = 3\), and \(c = 4\). We then calculate the sum of their squares:
  \[ 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 = 4 + 9 + 16 = 29 \]
  However, this does not match the expected result. Rechecking the problem, we realize that the correct values should be \(a = 3\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = 5\), leading to:
  \[ 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 = 9 + 16 + 25 = 50 \]
  This still does not match the expected result. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the problem constraints and the given conditions.
