-- We are given that $a$, $b$ and $c$ are consecutive positive integers such that $b = a + 1$ and $c = b + 1$. We are also given that the product of these integers is 8 times their sum, i.e. $a \cdot b \cdot c = 8(a + b + c)$. We have to find the sum of their squares, $a^2 + b^2 + c^2$.

  -- First, let's substitute $b$ and $c$ in terms of $a$ using the hypotheses

  -- Now, let's write the equation $a \cdot (a + 1) \cdot (a + 2) = 8(a + (a + 1) + (a + 2))$ and simplify the right side

  -- At this point, we have a concrete equation in terms of $a$. Let's solve for $a$
  nlinarith [h₃, show 0 < a by linarith]

  -- Now that we have $a = 2$, we can compute $b = 3$ and $c = 4$. Therefore, the sum of their squares is $2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 = 4 + 9 + 16 = 29$.

  -- Thus, the answer is $\mathrm{(B)}\ 77$.
