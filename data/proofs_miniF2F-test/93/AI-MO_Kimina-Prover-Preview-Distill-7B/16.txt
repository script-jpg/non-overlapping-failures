-- Some bounds to help us search for the answer
  have upper : a < 100 := by nlinarith
  have lower : 1 ≤ a := by nlinarith
  have upper' : b < 100 := by nlinarith
  have lower' : 1 ≤ b := by nlinarith
  have upper' : c < 100 := by nlinarith
  have lower' : 1 ≤ c := by nlinarith

  -- Now that we've bounded the search space, we can use a computational approach to find the answer
  interval_cases a <;> interval_cases b <;> interval_cases c
  <;> norm_num at h₁ h₂ h₃
  <;> norm_num
  <;> omega
