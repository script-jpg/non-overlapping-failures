/- The problem is to find the sum of squares of three consecutive integers
     where the product of the integers is 8 times their sum. The final answer
     is 77 which is (B).-/

  /- The condition that product is 8 times sum means $a(a+1)(a+2) = 8(a + (a+1)
     + (a+2)) = 24a$. The LHS is $a^3 + 3a^2 + 2a$ and the RHS is $24a$. This
     leads to the equation $a^3 + 3a^2 + 2a = 24a$, or $a^3 + 3a^2 - 22a =
     0$. This equation can be factored as $a(a + 3)(a - 22) = 0$ where
     $a \neq 0$ as $a$ is positive. So $a = 22$.-/
