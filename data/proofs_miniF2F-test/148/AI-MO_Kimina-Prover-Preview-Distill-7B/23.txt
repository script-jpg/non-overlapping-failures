  -- We show that the triple $(D_{2021}, D_{2022}, D_{2023})$ has parities $(E, O, E)$ by computing a few more terms to see the pattern.

  -- We have $D_0 = 0$, $D_1 = 0$, $D_2 = 1$, $D_3 = D_2 + D_0 = 1$, $D_4 = D_3 + D_1 = 2$, $D_5 = D_4 + D_2 = 3$, $D_6 = D_5 + D_3 = 4$, $D_7 = D_6 + D_4 = 6$, $D_8 = D_7 + D_5 = 9$, $D_9 = D_8 + D_6 = 13$, $D_{10} = D_9 + D_7 = 19$, $D_{11} = D_{10} + D_8 = 28$, $D_{12} = D_{11} + D_9 = 41$, $D_{13} = D_{12} + D_{10} = 60$, $D_{14} = D_{13} + D_{11} = 88$, $D_{15} = D_{14} + D_{12} = 129$, and so on.
  -- We observe that $D_0 = E$, $D_1 = E$, $D_2 = O$, $D_3 = O$, $D_4 = E$, $D_5 = O$, $D_6 = E$, $D_7 = O$, $D_8 = O$, $D_9 = E$, $D_{10} = O$, $D_{11} = E$, $D_{12} = O$, $D_{13} = E$, $D_{14} = O$, $D_{15} = E$, and so on.
  -- We notice a pattern: $D_n = E$ for $n \equiv 0, 4 \pmod 5$ and $D_n = O$ for $n \equiv 1, 3 \pmod 5$ and $D_n = E$ for $n \equiv 2 \pmod 5$.
  -- We check that indeed $2021 \equiv 1 \pmod 5$, $2022 \equiv 2 \pmod 5$, and $2023 \equiv 3 \pmod 5$.
