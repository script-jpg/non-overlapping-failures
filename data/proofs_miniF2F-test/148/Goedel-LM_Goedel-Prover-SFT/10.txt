  To determine the parities of the triple \((D_{2021}, D_{2022}, D_{2023})\), we need to analyze the sequence \(D_n\) defined by \(D_0 = 0\), \(D_1 = 0\), \(D_2 = 1\), and \(D_n = D_{n-1} + D_{n-3}\) for \(n \geq 3\). We will compute the values of \(D_n\) up to \(n = 2021\) and check their parities.
  1. **Base Cases**:
     - \(D_0 = 0\) (even)
     - \(D_1 = 0\) (even)
     - \(D_2 = 1\) (odd)
  2. **Recursive Definition**:
     - For \(n \geq 3\), \(D_n = D_{n-1} + D_{n-3}\)
  3. **Parity Analysis**:
     - Since \(D_n\) is a sum of two numbers \(D_{n-1}\) and \(D_{n-3}\), the parity of \(D_n\) depends on the parity of \(D_{n-1}\) and \(D_{n-3}\).
     - If \(D_{n-1}\) and \(D_{n-3}\) are both even, then \(D_n\) is even.
     - If \(D_{n-1}\) and \(D_{n-3}\) are both odd, then \(D_n\) is even.
     - If one of \(D_{n-1}\) or \(D_{n-3}\) is even and the other is odd, then \(D_n\) is odd.
  Given the recursive nature of the sequence, we can observe that the parity of \(D_n\) alternates between odd and even based on the parity of the previous terms. Specifically, the sequence \(D_n\) can be shown to follow a pattern where odd and even terms alternate.
  Thus, the triple \((D_{2021}, D_{2022}, D_{2023})\) is expected to be \((O, E, O)\).
