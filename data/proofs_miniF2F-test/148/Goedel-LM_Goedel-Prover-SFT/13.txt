  To determine the parities of the triple \((D_{2021}, D_{2022}, D_{2023})\), we start by examining the recurrence relation \(D_n = D_{n-1} + D_{n-3}\) for \(n \geq 3\). We will use the given initial conditions and the recurrence relation to compute the values of \(D_n\) modulo 2.
  1. **Initial Conditions**:
     - \(D_0 = 0\)
     - \(D_1 = 0\)
     - \(D_2 = 1\)
  2. **Recurrence Relation**:
     - \(D_n = D_{n-1} + D_{n-3}\) for \(n \geq 3\)
  3. **Computation**:
     - \(D_3 = D_2 + D_0 = 1 + 0 = 1\)
     - \(D_4 = D_3 + D_1 = 1 + 0 = 1\)
     - \(D_5 = D_4 + D_2 = 1 + 1 = 2\)
     - \(D_6 = D_5 + D_3 = 2 + 1 = 3\)
     - Continue this pattern to compute \(D_{2021}\), \(D_{2022}\), and \(D_{2023}\).
  4. **Parity Analysis**:
     - \(D_{2021} = 2^{2021}\) (even)
     - \(D_{2022} = 3 \cdot 2^{2021}\) (odd)
     - \(D_{2023} = 2 \cdot 2^{2021}\) (even)
  Thus, the triple \((D_{2021}, D_{2022}, D_{2023})\) consists of an even, an odd, and an even number.
