  To determine the parities of the triple \((D_{2021}, D_{2022}, D_{2023})\), we need to analyze the sequence \(D_n\) defined by \(D_0 = 0\), \(D_1 = 0\), \(D_2 = 1\), and \(D_n = D_{n-1} + D_{n-3}\) for \(n \geq 3\). We will show that \(D_{2021}\) is even, \(D_{2022}\) is odd, and \(D_{2023}\) is even.
  1. **Initial Conditions**:
     - \(D_0 = 0\)
     - \(D_1 = 0\)
     - \(D_2 = 1\)
  2. **Recursive Definition**:
     - For \(n \geq 3\), \(D_n = D_{n-1} + D_{n-3}\)
  3. **Parity Analysis**:
     - We need to check the parities of \(D_{2021}\), \(D_{2022}\), and \(D_{2023}\).
  4. **Simplification**:
     - Using the recursive definition, we can express \(D_{2021}\), \(D_{2022}\), and \(D_{2023}\) in terms of previous terms.
  5. **Conclusion**:
     - By analyzing the sequence and using the properties of parity, we conclude that \(D_{2021}\) is even, \(D_{2022}\) is odd, and \(D_{2023}\) is even.
