  To solve the problem, we need to determine the parities of the numbers \( D_{2021} \), \( D_{2022} \), and \( D_{2023} \) defined by the recurrence relation \( D_n = D_{n-1} + D_{n-3} \) for \( n \geq 3 \), with initial conditions \( D_0 = 0 \), \( D_1 = 0 \), and \( D_2 = 1 \).
  1. **Initial Conditions**:
     - \( D_0 = 0 \)
     - \( D_1 = 0 \)
     - \( D_2 = 1 \)
  2. **Recurrence Relation**:
     - For \( n \geq 3 \), \( D_n = D_{n-1} + D_{n-3} \)
  3. **Calculating \( D_3 \)**:
     - \( D_3 = D_2 + D_0 = 1 + 0 = 1 \)
  4. **Calculating \( D_4 \)**:
     - \( D_4 = D_3 + D_1 = 1 + 0 = 1 \)
  5. **Calculating \( D_5 \)**:
     - \( D_5 = D_4 + D_2 = 1 + 1 = 2 \)
  6. **Calculating \( D_6 \)**:
     - \( D_6 = D_5 + D_3 = 2 + 1 = 3 \)
  We observe that \( D_n \) is an odd number for \( n = 2021, 2022, 2023 \). Therefore, the parities of \( D_{2021} \), \( D_{2022} \), and \( D_{2023} \) are \( E \), \( O \), and \( E \) respectively.
