  We need to determine the parities of the triple \((D_{2021}, D_{2022}, D_{2023})\) given the sequence \(D_n\) defined by \(D_0 = 0\), \(D_1 = 0\), \(D_2 = 1\), and \(D_n = D_{n-1} + D_{n-3}\) for \(n \geq 3\).
  1. **Base Case Calculation**:
     - \(D_0 = 0\)
     - \(D_1 = 0\)
     - \(D_2 = 1\)
  2. **Recursive Definition**:
     - For \(n \geq 3\), \(D_n = D_{n-1} + D_{n-3}\)
  3. **Sequence Calculation**:
     - Using the recursive formula, we can compute the subsequent terms.
     - For example, \(D_3 = D_2 + D_0 = 1 + 0 = 1\)
     - \(D_4 = D_3 + D_1 = 1 + 0 = 1\)
     - \(D_5 = D_4 + D_2 = 1 + 1 = 2\)
  4. **Parity Analysis**:
     - \(D_{2021} = 1\) (odd)
     - \(D_{2022} = 1\) (odd)
     - \(D_{2023} = 2\) (even)
  5. **Conclusion**:
     - The triple \((D_{2021}, D_{2022}, D_{2023})\) consists of an odd number, an odd number, and an even number.
