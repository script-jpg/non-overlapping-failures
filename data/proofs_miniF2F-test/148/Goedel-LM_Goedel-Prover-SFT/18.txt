  We need to determine the parities of the numbers \( D_{2021} \), \( D_{2022} \), and \( D_{2023} \) given the recurrence relation \( D_n = D_{n-1} + D_{n-3} \) with initial conditions \( D_0 = 0 \), \( D_1 = 0 \), and \( D_2 = 1 \).
  1. **Initial Conditions**:
     - \( D_0 = 0 \)
     - \( D_1 = 0 \)
     - \( D_2 = 1 \)
  2. **Recurrence Relation**:
     - \( D_n = D_{n-1} + D_{n-3} \) for \( n \geq 3 \)
  3. **Calculations**:
     - \( D_3 = D_2 + D_0 = 1 + 0 = 1 \) (odd)
     - \( D_4 = D_3 + D_1 = 1 + 0 = 1 \) (odd)
     - \( D_5 = D_4 + D_2 = 1 + 1 = 2 \) (even)
     - \( D_6 = D_5 + D_3 = 2 + 1 = 3 \) (odd)
     - \( D_7 = D_6 + D_4 = 3 + 1 = 4 \) (even)
     - \( D_8 = D_7 + D_5 = 4 + 2 = 6 \) (even)
  By induction, we observe that \( D_n \) alternates between odd and even for \( n \geq 3 \).

  -- Part 1: Prove that d 2021 is even.
  -- By induction, we observe that d n alternates between odd and even for n ≥ 3.
  -- Since 2021 ≡ 1 (mod 3), d 2021 is odd.
