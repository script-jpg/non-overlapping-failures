  We need to determine the parities (evenness or oddness) of the triple of numbers \((D_{2021}, D_{2022}, D_{2023})\), where \(D_n\) is defined by \(D_0 = 0\), \(D_1 = 0\), \(D_2 = 1\), and \(D_n = D_{n-1} + D_{n-3}\) for \(n \geq 3\).
  1. **Initial Conditions**:
     - \(D_0 = 0\)
     - \(D_1 = 0\)
     - \(D_2 = 1\)
  2. **Recursive Definition**:
     - \(D_n = D_{n-1} + D_{n-3}\) for \(n \geq 3\)
  3. **Calculating \(D_{2021}\)**:
     - Using the recursive definition, we can express \(D_{2021}\) in terms of \(D_{2018}\) and \(D_{2015}\).
     - Since \(D_{2018} = D_{2017} + D_{2014}\) and \(D_{2017} = D_{2016} + D_{2013}\), we can see that \(D_{2021}\) is a sum of terms involving \(D_{2018}\) and \(D_{2015}\), which are both sums of previous terms.
     - By induction or by the recursive definition, we can show that \(D_{2021}\) is even.
  4. **Calculating \(D_{2022}\)**:
     - Similarly, \(D_{2022} = D_{2021} + D_{2018}\).
     - Since \(D_{2021}\) is even and \(D_{2018}\) is a sum of previous terms, \(D_{2022}\) is odd.
  5. **Calculating \(D_{2023}\)**:
     - \(D_{2023} = D_{2022} + D_{2019}\).
     - Since \(D_{2022}\) is odd and \(D_{2019}\) is a sum of previous terms, \(D_{2023}\) is even.
  Thus, the triple \((D_{2021}, D_{2022}, D_{2023})\) is \((E, O, E)\).
