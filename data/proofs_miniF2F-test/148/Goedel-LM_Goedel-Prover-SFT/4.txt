  To determine the parities of the triple \((D_{2021}, D_{2022}, D_{2023})\), we start by analyzing the given sequence defined by \(D_0 = 0\), \(D_1 = 0\), \(D_2 = 1\), and the recurrence relation \(D_n = D_{n-1} + D_{n-3}\) for \(n \geq 3\).
  1. **Initial Conditions**:
     - \(D_0 = 0\)
     - \(D_1 = 0\)
     - \(D_2 = 1\)
  2. **Recurrence Relation**:
     - For \(n \geq 3\), \(D_n = D_{n-1} + D_{n-3}\)
  3. **Calculating \(D_{2021}\)**:
     - Using the recurrence relation, we can express \(D_{2021}\) in terms of \(D_{2020}\), \(D_{2019}\), and \(D_{2018}\).
     - By iterating the recurrence relation, we can see that \(D_{2021}\) is a sum of terms involving \(D_{2020}\), \(D_{2019}\), and \(D_{2018}\).
  4. **Parity Analysis**:
     - Since \(D_2 = 1\) and \(D_3 = D_2 + D_0 = 1 + 0 = 1\), we can see that \(D_3\) is odd.
     - By induction, we can show that \(D_n\) is odd for \(n \geq 3\).
  5. **Conclusion**:
     - Given the sequence properties, \(D_{2021}\) is odd, \(D_{2022}\) is even, and \(D_{2023}\) is even.
