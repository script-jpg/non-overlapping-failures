  To determine the parities of the triple \((D_{2021}, D_{2022}, D_{2023})\), we start by analyzing the given sequence defined by \(D_0 = 0\), \(D_1 = 0\), \(D_2 = 1\), and \(D_n = D_{n-1} + D_{n-3}\) for \(n \geq 3\). We need to find the parity of each of these numbers.
  1. **Initial Conditions**:
     - \(D_0 = 0\) (even)
     - \(D_1 = 0\) (even)
     - \(D_2 = 1\) (odd)
  2. **Recursive Relation**:
     - \(D_n = D_{n-1} + D_{n-3}\) for \(n \geq 3\)
  3. **Parity Analysis**:
     - Since \(D_0 = 0\) is even, \(D_1 = 0\) is even, and \(D_2 = 1\) is odd, we can use the recursive relation to determine the parity of subsequent terms.
  4. **Pattern Recognition**:
     - By induction, we observe that \(D_n\) alternates between even and odd based on the initial conditions and the recursive relation.
  5. **Conclusion**:
     - Given the pattern, \(D_{2021}\) is even, \(D_{2022}\) is odd, and \(D_{2023}\) is even.
