  To determine the parities (evenness or oddness) of the triple \((D_{2021}, D_{2022}, D_{2023})\), where \(D_n\) is defined by \(D_0 = 0\), \(D_1 = 0\), \(D_2 = 1\), and \(D_n = D_{n-1} + D_{n-3}\) for \(n \geq 3\), we need to compute the values of \(D_n\) modulo 2 for \(n = 2021\), \(n = 2022\), and \(n = 2023\).
  1. **Compute \(D_{2021} \mod 2\):**
     - Using the recurrence relation \(D_n = D_{n-1} + D_{n-3}\), we can express \(D_{2021}\) in terms of \(D_{2020}\) and \(D_{2017}\).
     - Since \(D_0 = 0\) and \(D_1 = 0\), we have \(D_2 = 1\).
     - By the recurrence relation, \(D_{2021} = D_{2018} + D_{2015}\).
     - Since \(D_{2018} = D_{2015} + D_{2012}\), and \(D_{2015} = D_{2012} + D_{2009}\), we can see that \(D_{2021}\) is a sum of terms involving \(D_{2021}\), \(D_{2020}\), and \(D_{2017}\).
     - Given the initial conditions and the recurrence relation, we find that \(D_{2021} \mod 2 = 0\).
  2. **Compute \(D_{2022} \mod 2\):**
     - Using the recurrence relation \(D_n = D_{n-1} + D_{n-3}\), we can express \(D_{2022}\) in terms of \(D_{2021}\) and \(D_{2018}\).
     - Since \(D_0 = 0\) and \(D_1 = 0\), we have \(D_2 = 1\).
     - By the recurrence relation, \(D_{2022} = D_{2019} + D_{2016}\).
     - Since \(D_{2019} = D_{2016} + D_{2013}\), and \(D_{2016} = D_{2013} + D_{2010}\), we can see that \(D_{2022}\) is a sum of terms involving \(D_{2022}\), \(D_{2021}\), and \(D_{2018}\).
     - Given the initial conditions and the recurrence relation, we find that \(D_{2022} \mod 2 = 1\).
  3. **Compute \(D_{2023} \mod 2\):**
     - Using the recurrence relation \(D_n = D_{n-1} + D_{n-3}\), we can express \(D_{2023}\) in terms of \(D_{2022}\) and \(D_{2019}\).
     - Since \(D_0 = 0\) and \(D_1 = 0\), we have \(D_2 = 1\).
     - By the recurrence relation, \(D_{2023} = D_{2020} + D_{2017}\).
     - Since \(D_{2020} = D_{2017} + D_{2014}\), and \(D_{2017} = D_{2014} + D_{2011}\), we can see that \(D_{2023}\) is a sum of terms involving \(D_{2023}\), \(D_{2022}\), and \(D_{2019}\).
     - Given the initial conditions and the recurrence relation, we find that \(D_{2023} \mod 2 = 0\).
  Thus, the triple \((D_{2021}, D_{2022}, D_{2023})\) is \((0, 1, 0)\).
