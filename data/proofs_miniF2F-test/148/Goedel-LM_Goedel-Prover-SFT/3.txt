  To solve the problem, we need to determine the parities of the numbers \( D_{2021}, D_{2022}, \) and \( D_{2023} \) given the recurrence relation \( D_n = D_{n-1} + D_{n-3} \) for \( n \geq 3 \).
  1. **Initial Conditions**:
     - \( D_0 = 0 \)
     - \( D_1 = 0 \)
     - \( D_2 = 1 \)
  2. **Recurrence Relation**:
     - For \( n \geq 3 \), \( D_n = D_{n-1} + D_{n-3} \)
  3. **Sequence Calculation**:
     - Using the recurrence relation, we can compute the values of \( D_n \) for higher \( n \).
  4. **Parity Analysis**:
     - We need to check the parity of \( D_{2021}, D_{2022}, \) and \( D_{2023} \).
  Given the recurrence relation, we can observe that the sequence \( D_n \) is influenced by the parity of the previous terms. Specifically, the parity of \( D_n \) can be determined by the parity of the sum of the previous terms.
