  To solve the problem, we need to determine the parities of the triple \((D_{2021}, D_{2022}, D_{2023})\) given the sequence \(D_n\) defined by \(D_0 = 0\), \(D_1 = 0\), \(D_2 = 1\), and \(D_n = D_{n-1} + D_{n-3}\) for \(n \geq 3\).
  1. **Base Cases**:
     - \(D_0 = 0\)
     - \(D_1 = 0\)
     - \(D_2 = 1\)
  2. **Recursive Definition**:
     - For \(n \geq 3\), \(D_n = D_{n-1} + D_{n-3}\)
  3. **Parities**:
     - We need to determine the parities of \(D_{2021}\), \(D_{2022}\), and \(D_{2023}\).
  4. **Verification**:
     - Using the recursive definition and the initial conditions, we can compute the values of \(D_n\) modulo 2 to find the parities.
