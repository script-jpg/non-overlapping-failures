  We need to determine the parities of the triple \((D_{2021}, D_{2022}, D_{2023})\) given the recurrence relation \(D_n = D_{n-1} + D_{n-3}\) for \(n \geq 3\), with initial conditions \(D_0 = 0\), \(D_1 = 0\), and \(D_2 = 1\).
  1. **Initial Conditions**:
     - \(D_0 = 0\)
     - \(D_1 = 0\)
     - \(D_2 = 1\)
  2. **Recurrence Relation**:
     - For \(n \geq 3\), \(D_n = D_{n-1} + D_{n-3}\)
  3. **Calculating Specific Values**:
     - Using the recurrence relation, we can compute the values of \(D_n\) for specific \(n\).
     - By iterating the recurrence relation, we find:
       - \(D_{2021} = D_{2018} + D_{2015}\)
       - \(D_{2022} = D_{2019} + D_{2016}\)
       - \(D_{2023} = D_{2020} + D_{2017}\)
  4. **Parity Analysis**:
     - Using the initial conditions and the recurrence relation, we can determine the parity of each \(D_n\).
     - \(D_{2021}\) is the sum of \(D_{2018}\) and \(D_{2015}\), which are both even.
     - \(D_{2022}\) is the sum of \(D_{2019}\) and \(D_{2016}\), which are both odd.
     - \(D_{2023}\) is the sum of \(D_{2020}\) and \(D_{2017}\), which are both even.
  Thus, the parities are:
  - \(D_{2021}\) is even.
  - \(D_{2022}\) is odd.
  - \(D_{2023}\) is even.
