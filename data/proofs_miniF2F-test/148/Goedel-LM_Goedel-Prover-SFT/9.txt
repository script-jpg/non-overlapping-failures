  We need to determine the parities of the triple \((D_{2021}, D_{2022}, D_{2023})\) given the sequence \(D_n\) defined by \(D_0 = 0\), \(D_1 = 0\), \(D_2 = 1\), and the recurrence relation \(D_n = D_{n-1} + D_{n-3}\) for \(n \geq 3\).
  1. **Initial Values**:
     - \(D_0 = 0\)
     - \(D_1 = 0\)
     - \(D_2 = 1\)
  2. **Recurrence Relation**:
     - For \(n \geq 3\), \(D_n = D_{n-1} + D_{n-3}\)
  3. **Computation**:
     - Using the recurrence relation, we can compute the values of \(D_n\) for \(n = 3\) to \(n = 2021\).
  4. **Parity Analysis**:
     - We need to determine the parities of \(D_{2021}\), \(D_{2022}\), and \(D_{2023}\).
  5. **Conclusion**:
     - By induction or direct computation, we find that \(D_{2021}\) is even, \(D_{2022}\) is odd, and \(D_{2023}\) is even.
