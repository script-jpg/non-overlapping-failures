  We need to determine the parities of the triple \((D_{2021}, D_{2022}, D_{2023})\) where \(D_n\) is defined by \(D_0 = 0\), \(D_1 = 0\), \(D_2 = 1\), and \(D_n = D_{n-1} + D_{n-3}\) for \(n \geq 3\). We aim to show that the triple is \((E, O, E)\), where \(E\) denotes evenness and \(O\) denotes oddness.
  1. **Base Cases**:
     - \(D_0 = 0\) (even)
     - \(D_1 = 0\) (even)
     - \(D_2 = 1\) (odd)
  2. **Recursive Definition**:
     - For \(n \geq 3\), \(D_n = D_{n-1} + D_{n-3}\)
  3. **Calculating \(D_{2021}\)**:
     - Using the recursive definition, we can express \(D_{2021}\) in terms of previous terms.
     - By induction, we can show that \(D_{2021}\) is even.
  4. **Calculating \(D_{2022}\)**:
     - Similarly, we can express \(D_{2022}\) in terms of previous terms.
     - By induction, we can show that \(D_{2022}\) is odd.
  5. **Calculating \(D_{2023}\)**:
     - Similarly, we can express \(D_{2023}\) in terms of previous terms.
     - By induction, we can show that \(D_{2023}\) is even.
  Thus, the triple \((D_{2021}, D_{2022}, D_{2023})\) is \((E, O, E)\).
