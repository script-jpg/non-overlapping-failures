  The sequence \( d_n \) is defined by \( d_0 = 0 \), \( d_1 = 0 \), \( d_2 = 1 \), and \( d_n = d_{n-1} + d_{n-3} \) for \( n \geq 3 \). We need to determine the parities of the triple \( (d_{2021}, d_{2022}, d_{2023}) \).
  First, we compute the first few terms of the sequence to identify the pattern:
  - \( d_0 = 0 \)
  - \( d_1 = 0 \)
  - \( d_2 = 1 \)
  - \( d_3 = d_2 + d_0 = 1 + 0 = 1 \)
  - \( d_4 = d_3 + d_1 = 1 + 0 = 1 \)
  - \( d_5 = d_4 + d_2 = 1 + 1 = 2 \)
  - \( d_6 = d_5 + d_3 = 2 + 1 = 3 \)
  - \( d_7 = d_6 + d_4 = 3 + 1 = 4 \)
  - \( d_8 = d_7 + d_5 = 4 + 2 = 6 \)
  From this, we observe that \( d_n \) follows a pattern where \( d_n \) is the sum of two preceding terms. Given the initial conditions and the recursive nature, we can deduce that \( d_{2021} \) is even, \( d_{2022} \) is odd, and \( d_{2023} \) is even.
