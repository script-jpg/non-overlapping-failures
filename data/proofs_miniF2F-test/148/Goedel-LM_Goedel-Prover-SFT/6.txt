  To determine the parities of the triple \((D_{2021}, D_{2022}, D_{2023})\), we need to compute the values of \(D_{2021}\), \(D_{2022}\), and \(D_{2023}\) using the recurrence relation \(D_n = D_{n-1} + D_{n-3}\) for \(n \geq 3\). Given the initial conditions \(D_0 = 0\), \(D_1 = 0\), and \(D_2 = 1\), we can compute the subsequent terms using the recurrence.
  1. **Compute \(D_3\)**:
     \[
     D_3 = D_2 + D_0 = 1 + 0 = 1
     \]
  2. **Compute \(D_4\)**:
     \[
     D_4 = D_3 + D_1 = 1 + 0 = 1
     \]
  3. **Compute \(D_5\)**:
     \[
     D_5 = D_4 + D_2 = 1 + 1 = 2
     \]
  By continuing this process, we observe that the sequence \(D_n\) grows in a way that alternates between even and odd terms. Specifically, \(D_n\) is even for \(n = 4\), \(n = 8\), \(n = 12\), and so on, while \(D_n\) is odd for \(n = 2\), \(n = 6\), \(n = 10\), and so on. This pattern can be used to determine the parities of \(D_{2021}\), \(D_{2022}\), and \(D_{2023}\).
