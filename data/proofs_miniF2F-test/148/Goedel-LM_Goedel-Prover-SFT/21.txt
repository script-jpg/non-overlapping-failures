  We need to determine the parities of the numbers \( D_{2021} \), \( D_{2022} \), and \( D_{2023} \) in the given sequence defined by \( D_0 = 0 \), \( D_1 = 0 \), \( D_2 = 1 \), and \( D_n = D_{n-1} + D_{n-3} \) for \( n \geq 3 \).
  1. **Base Cases**:
     - \( D_0 = 0 \) (even)
     - \( D_1 = 0 \) (even)
     - \( D_2 = 1 \) (odd)
  2. **Recursive Definition**:
     - For \( n \geq 3 \), \( D_n = D_{n-1} + D_{n-3} \)
  3. **Parity Calculation**:
     - Using the recursive definition, we can compute the parities of subsequent terms.
     - For \( n = 3 \), \( D_3 = D_2 + D_0 = 1 + 0 = 1 \) (odd)
     - For \( n = 4 \), \( D_4 = D_3 + D_1 = 1 + 0 = 1 \) (odd)
     - For \( n = 5 \), \( D_5 = D_4 + D_2 = 1 + 1 = 2 \) (even)
     - For \( n = 6 \), \( D_6 = D_5 + D_3 = 2 + 1 = 3 \) (odd)
     - For \( n = 7 \), \( D_7 = D_6 + D_4 = 3 + 1 = 4 \) (even)
     - For \( n = 8 \), \( D_8 = D_7 + D_5 = 4 + 2 = 6 \) (even)
     - For \( n = 9 \), \( D_9 = D_8 + D_6 = 6 + 3 = 9 \) (odd)
  4. **Pattern Recognition**:
     - The sequence alternates between odd and even terms.
