  We need to determine the parities of the triple \((D_{2021}, D_{2022}, D_{2023})\) where \(D_n = D_{n-1} + D_{n-3}\) for \(n \geq 3\).
  1. **Initial Conditions**:
     - \(D_0 = 0\)
     - \(D_1 = 0\)
     - \(D_2 = 1\)
  2. **Recursive Relation**:
     - For \(n \geq 3\), \(D_n = D_{n-1} + D_{n-3}\)
  3. **Pattern Recognition**:
     - Using the recursive relation, we can observe a pattern in the sequence.
  4. **Verification of Parities**:
     - We need to verify the parities of \(D_{2021}\), \(D_{2022}\), and \(D_{2023}\).

  -- Using the recursive relation and initial conditions, we derive a pattern in the sequence.
  -- We then use this pattern to verify the parities of the specified terms.
