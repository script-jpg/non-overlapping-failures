  To determine the parities of the triple \((D_{2021}, D_{2022}, D_{2023})\), we start by examining the sequence \(D_n\) defined by \(D_0 = 0\), \(D_1 = 0\), \(D_2 = 1\), and \(D_n = D_{n-1} + D_{n-3}\) for \(n \geq 3\). We need to show that \(D_{2021}\) is even, \(D_{2022}\) is odd, and \(D_{2023}\) is even.
  First, we use the recurrence relation to compute the values of \(D_n\) for \(n = 3\) to \(n = 6\):
  - \(D_3 = D_2 + D_0 = 1 + 0 = 1\) (odd)
  - \(D_4 = D_3 + D_1 = 1 + 0 = 1\) (odd)
  - \(D_5 = D_4 + D_2 = 1 + 1 = 2\) (even)
  - \(D_6 = D_5 + D_3 = 2 + 1 = 3\) (odd)
  From this, we observe that the sequence alternates between odd and even values. Specifically, \(D_n\) is odd if \(n\) is odd and even if \(n\) is even. Given that 2021 is odd and 2022 is even, we conclude:
  - \(D_{2021}\) is odd.
  - \(D_{2022}\) is even.
  - \(D_{2023}\) is even.
