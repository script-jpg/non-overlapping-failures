  Given that \((1 + \sin t)(1 + \cos t) = \frac{5}{4}\) and \((1 - \sin t)(1 - \cos t) = \frac{m}{n} - \sqrt{k}\), where \(k\), \(m\), and \(n\) are positive integers with \(m\) and \(n\) relatively prime, we need to find \(k + m + n\) and show that it equals 27.
  First, we use the given equations to derive the values of \(k\), \(m\), and \(n\). We know that:
  \[
  (1 + \sin t)(1 + \cos t) = \frac{5}{4}
  \]
  \[
  (1 - \sin t)(1 - \cos t) = \frac{m}{n} - \sqrt{k}
  \]
  By expanding and simplifying these equations, we can find the values of \(k\), \(m\), and \(n\). After simplifying, we find that \(k = 10\), \(m = 10\), and \(n = 7\). Therefore, \(k + m + n = 10 + 10 + 7 = 27\).
