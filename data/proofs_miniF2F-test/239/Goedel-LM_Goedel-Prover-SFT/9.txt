  Given that \((1 + \sin t)(1 + \cos t) = \frac{5}{4}\) and \((1 - \sin t)(1 - \cos t) = \frac{m}{n} - \sqrt{k}\), where \(k\), \(m\), and \(n\) are positive integers with \(m\) and \(n\) relatively prime, we need to find \(k + m + n\) and show that it equals 27.
  First, we use the given equations to derive relationships between \(\sin t\) and \(\cos t\). By expanding and simplifying the expressions, we can find specific values for \(\sin t\) and \(\cos t\). Using these values, we can then determine \(k\), \(m\), and \(n\) and verify that their sum equals 27.
