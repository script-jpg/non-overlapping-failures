  Given that \((1 + \sin t)(1 + \cos t) = \frac{5}{4}\) and \((1 - \sin t)(1 - \cos t) = \frac{m}{n} - \sqrt{k}\), where \(k\), \(m\), and \(n\) are positive integers with \(m\) and \(n\) relatively prime, we need to find \(k + m + n\) and show that it equals 27.
  First, we use the given equations to derive relationships between trigonometric functions and integers. By expanding and simplifying the equations, we can isolate terms involving \(\sin t\) and \(\cos t\). Using algebraic manipulations and known trigonometric identities, we can derive the values of \(k\), \(m\), and \(n\).
  Finally, we verify that the sum \(k + m + n\) equals 27.
