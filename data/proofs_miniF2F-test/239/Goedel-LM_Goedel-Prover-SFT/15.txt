  Given that \((1 + \sin t)(1 + \cos t) = \frac{5}{4}\) and \((1 - \sin t)(1 - \cos t) = \frac{m}{n} - \sqrt{k}\), where \(k\), \(m\), and \(n\) are positive integers with \(m\) and \(n\) relatively prime, we need to find \(k + m + n\) and show that it equals 27.
  1. Start by simplifying the given equations using trigonometric identities and algebraic manipulations.
  2. Use the fact that \(\sin^2 t + \cos^2 t = 1\) to further simplify the expressions.
  3. Substitute the simplified expressions back into the equations and solve for \(k\), \(m\), and \(n\).
  4. Verify that the values of \(k\), \(m\), and \(n\) satisfy the conditions and conclude that \(k + m + n = 27\).
