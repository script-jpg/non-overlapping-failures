  Given the equations \((1 + \sin t)(1 + \cos t) = \frac{5}{4}\) and \((1 - \sin t)(1 - \cos t) = \frac{m}{n} - \sqrt{k}\), where \(k\), \(m\), and \(n\) are positive integers with \(m\) and \(n\) relatively prime, we need to find \(k + m + n\) and show that it equals 27.
  First, we simplify the given equations using algebraic manipulations and numerical calculations to derive the values of \(k\), \(m\), and \(n\).
