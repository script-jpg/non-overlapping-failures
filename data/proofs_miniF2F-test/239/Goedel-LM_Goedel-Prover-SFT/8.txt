  Given that \((1 + \sin t)(1 + \cos t) = \frac{5}{4}\) and \((1 - \sin t)(1 - \cos t) = \frac{m}{n} - \sqrt{k}\), where \(k\), \(m\), and \(n\) are positive integers with \(m\) and \(n\) relatively prime, we need to find \(k + m + n\) and show that it equals 27.
  First, we use the given equations to derive relationships between \(\sin t\) and \(\cos t\). We then use these relationships to find the values of \(k\), \(m\), and \(n\). Finally, we sum \(k\), \(m\), and \(n\) to verify that their sum equals 27.
