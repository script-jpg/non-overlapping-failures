  Given that \((1 + \sin t)(1 + \cos t) = \frac{5}{4}\) and \((1 - \sin t)(1 - \cos t) = \frac{m}{n} - \sqrt{k}\), where \(k\), \(m\), and \(n\) are positive integers with \(m\) and \(n\) relatively prime, we need to find \(k + m + n\) and show that it equals 27.
  1. Start by simplifying the given equations using algebraic manipulations.
  2. Use the fact that \(\sin t\) and \(\cos t\) are bounded by \([-1, 1]\) to derive bounds for the expressions involving \(\sin t\) and \(\cos t\).
  3. Substitute these bounds into the equations to simplify and solve for the required values.
  4. Verify that the sum \(k + m + n\) equals 27.
