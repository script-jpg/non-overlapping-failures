  Given that \((1 + \sin t)(1 + \cos t) = \frac{5}{4}\) and \((1 - \sin t)(1 - \cos t) = \frac{m}{n} - \sqrt{k}\), where \(k\), \(m\), and \(n\) are positive integers with \(m\) and \(n\) relatively prime, we need to find \(k + m + n\) and show that it equals 27.
  First, we use the given equations to derive relationships between \(\sin t\) and \(\cos t\). By expanding and simplifying the expressions, we can find the values of \(\sin t\) and \(\cos t\). Using these values, we can then compute \(k\), \(m\), and \(n\) and verify that their sum equals 27.
