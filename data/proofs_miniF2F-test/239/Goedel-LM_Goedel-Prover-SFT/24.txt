  Given that \((1 + \sin t)(1 + \cos t) = \frac{5}{4}\) and \((1 - \sin t)(1 - \cos t) = \frac{m}{n} - \sqrt{k}\), where \(k\), \(m\), and \(n\) are positive integers with \(m\) and \(n\) relatively prime, we need to find \(k + m + n\). We will show that this sum equals 27.
  First, we use the given equations to derive the necessary relationships. By expanding and simplifying the expressions, we can find the values of \(k\), \(m\), and \(n\). Using the trigonometric identities and the given values, we can solve for \(k\), \(m\), and \(n\) and verify that their sum equals 27.
