We need to find \(ax^5 + by^5\) given the system of equations:
\[
\begin{align*}
ax + by &= 3, \\
ax^2 + by^2 &= 7, \\
ax^3 + by^3 &= 16, \\
ax^4 + by^4 &= 42.
\end{align*}
\]
We start by expressing the higher powers of \(x\) and \(y\) in terms of lower powers.

First, we multiply the first equation by \(x\):
\[
a x^2 + b y x = 3x
\]
Subtract the second equation from this:
\[
(a x^2 + b y x) - (a x^2 + b y^2) = 3x - 7
\]
Simplify:
\[
b y x - b y^2 = 3x - 7 \implies b y (x - y) = 3x - 7 \quad \text{(1)}
\]
Similarly, multiply the first equation by \(y\):
\[
a x y + b y^2 = 3y
\]
Subtract the second equation from this:
\[
(a x y + b y^2) - (a x^2 + b y^2) = 3y - 7
\]
Simplify:
\[
a x y - a x^2 = 3y - 7 \implies a x (y - x) = 3y - 7 \quad \text{(2)}
\]
Next, multiply the third equation by \(x\):
\[
a x^4 + b y^3 x = 16x
\]
Subtract the fourth equation from this:
\[
(a x^4 + b y^3 x) - (a x^4 + b y^4) = 16x - 42
\]
Simplify:
\[
b y^3 x - b y^4 = 16x - 42 \implies b y^3 (x - y) = 16x - 42 \quad \text{(3)}
\]
Similarly, multiply the third equation by \(y\):
\[
a x^3 y + b y^4 = 16y
\]
Subtract the fourth equation from this:
\[
(a x^3 y + b y^4) - (a x^4 + b y^4) = 16y - 42
\]
Simplify:
\[
a x^3 y - a x^4 = 16y - 42 \implies a x^3 (y - x) = 16y - 42 \quad \text{(4)}
\]
Now, we have four equations (1), (2), (3), and (4). We can solve these equations step by step to find \(a\), \(b\), \(x\), and \(y\).

From (1):
\[
b y (x - y) = 3x - 7
\]
From (2):
\[
a x (y - x) = 3y - 7
\]
From (3):
\[
b y^3 (x - y) = 16x - 42
\]
From (4):
\[
a x^3 (y - x
