  Given real numbers \(a, b, x, y\) that satisfy the equations:
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  ax + by &= 3, \\
  ax^2 + by^2 &= 7, \\
  ax^3 + by^3 &= 16, \\
  ax^4 + by^4 &= 42,
  \end{align*}
  \]
  we need to find \(ax^5 + by^5\).
  First, we express \(x\) and \(y\) in terms of the given equations. By solving the system of equations, we can derive expressions for \(x\) and \(y\) that satisfy all the given conditions. Using these expressions, we can then compute \(ax^5 + by^5\).
