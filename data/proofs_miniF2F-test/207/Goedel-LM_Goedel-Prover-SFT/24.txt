  Given real numbers \(a, b, x, y\) that satisfy the following equations:
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  ax + by &= 3, \\
  ax^2 + by^2 &= 7, \\
  ax^3 + by^3 &= 16, \\
  ax^4 + by^4 &= 42,
  \end{align*}
  \]
  we need to find \(ax^5 + by^5\).
  First, we express \(x\) and \(y\) in terms of the given equations. By manipulating the equations, we can derive expressions for \(x\) and \(y\) that satisfy all the given conditions. Using these expressions, we substitute back into the target equation to find \(ax^5 + by^5\).
