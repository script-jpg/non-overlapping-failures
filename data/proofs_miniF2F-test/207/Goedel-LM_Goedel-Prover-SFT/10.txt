  Given real numbers \(a, b, x, y\) that satisfy the following equations:
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  ax + by &= 3, \\
  ax^2 + by^2 &= 7, \\
  ax^3 + by^3 &= 16, \\
  ax^4 + by^4 &= 42,
  \end{align*}
  \]
  we need to find \(ax^5 + by^5\).
  First, we derive the values of higher powers of \(x\) and \(y\) by expressing them in terms of the lower powers and the constants. Specifically, we use the given equations to find \(x\) and \(y\) such that the above equations hold. By leveraging the relationships between the equations, we can compute the required expression.
