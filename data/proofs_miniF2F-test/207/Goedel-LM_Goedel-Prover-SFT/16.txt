  Given the equations involving real numbers \(a, b, x, y\):
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  ax + by &= 3, \\
  ax^2 + by^2 &= 7, \\
  ax^3 + by^3 &= 16, \\
  ax^4 + by^4 &= 42,
  \end{align*}
  \]
  we need to find \(ax^5 + by^5\).
  First, we normalize the expressions by expanding and simplifying them. Then, we use the given equations to derive the value of \(ax^5 + by^5\).
