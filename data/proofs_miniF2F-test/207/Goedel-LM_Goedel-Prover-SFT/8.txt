  Given real numbers \(a, b, x, y\) that satisfy the equations:
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  ax + by &= 3, \\
  ax^2 + by^2 &= 7, \\
  ax^3 + by^3 &= 16, \\
  ax^4 + by^4 &= 42,
  \end{align*}
  \]
  we need to find \(ax^5 + by^5\).
  First, we derive the values of \(ax^6 + by^6\) and \(ax^4 + by^4\) using the given equations. By subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:
  \[
  (ax + by)(ax + by) - (ax^2 + by^2)(ax + by) = 3 \cdot 3 - 7 \cdot 3 = 9 - 21 = -12.
  \]
  This simplifies to:
  \[
  a^2 x^2 + 2abxy + b^2 y^2 - a^2 x^2 - 2abxy - b^2 y^2 = -12.
  \]
  Thus, we have:
  \[
  0 = -12,
  \]
  which is a contradiction. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate our approach. Instead, we use the given equations directly to find \(ax^5 + by^5\).
