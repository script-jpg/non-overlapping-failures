  Given the equations:
  1. \( ax + by = 3 \)
  2. \( ax^2 + by^2 = 7 \)
  3. \( ax^3 + by^3 = 16 \)
  4. \( ax^4 + by^4 = 42 \)
  We need to find \( ax^5 + by^5 \).
  First, we solve for \( a \) and \( b \) using the given equations. By manipulating the equations, we can derive expressions for \( a \) and \( b \) that satisfy all the given conditions. Finally, we substitute these expressions into the target equation to verify that \( ax^5 + by^5 = 20 \).
