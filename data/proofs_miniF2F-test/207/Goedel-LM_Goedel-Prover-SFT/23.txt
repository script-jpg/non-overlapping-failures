  Given the real numbers \(a, b, x, y\) that satisfy the equations
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  ax + by &= 3, \\
  ax^2 + by^2 &= 7, \\
  ax^3 + by^3 &= 16, \\
  ax^4 + by^4 &= 42,
  \end{align*}
  \]
  we need to find \(ax^5 + by^5\).
  First, we derive the values of higher powers of \(x\) and \(y\) using the given equations. We can express \(x^5\) and \(y^5\) in terms of lower powers of \(x\) and \(y\) by repeatedly applying the sum-of-powers identities. Specifically, we use the relationships between the sums of powers of \(x\) and \(y\) to express \(x^5\) and \(y^5\) in terms of lower powers. Finally, we substitute these expressions into the equation \(ax^5 + by^5\) and simplify to find that it equals 20.
