  Given the real numbers \(a, b, x, y\) that satisfy the equations:
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  ax + by &= 3, \\
  ax^2 + by^2 &= 7, \\
  ax^3 + by^3 &= 16, \\
  ax^4 + by^4 &= 42,
  \end{align*}
  \]
  we need to find \(ax^5 + by^5\).
  First, we derive the values of \(ax^6 + by^6\) and \(ax^4 + by^4\) using the given equations. By manipulating the equations algebraically, we can isolate the terms involving \(x\) and \(y\).
  Next, we use these derived values to compute \(ax^5 + by^5\) by expressing it in terms of the known values and simplifying.
