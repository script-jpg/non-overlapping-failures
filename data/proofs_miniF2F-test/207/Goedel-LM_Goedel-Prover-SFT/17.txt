  Given real numbers \(a, b, x, y\) that satisfy the equations:
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  ax + by &= 3, \\
  ax^2 + by^2 &= 7, \\
  ax^3 + by^3 &= 16, \\
  ax^4 + by^4 &= 42,
  \end{align*}
  \]
  we need to find \(ax^5 + by^5\).
  First, we express \(x\) and \(y\) in terms of the given equations. By manipulating the equations, we can derive a system that allows us to solve for \(x\) and \(y\). Using the given equations, we can set up a system of linear equations and solve it to find the values of \(x\) and \(y\).
  Next, we substitute these values back into the expression \(ax^5 + by^5\) and simplify to verify that the result is 20.
