  Given real numbers \(a, b, x,\) and \(y\) that satisfy the following equations:
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  ax + by &= 3, \\
  ax^2 + by^2 &= 7, \\
  ax^3 + by^3 &= 16, \\
  ax^4 + by^4 &= 42,
  \end{align*}
  \]
  we need to find \(ax^5 + by^5\).
  First, we derive the values of higher powers of \(x\) and \(y\) by expressing them in terms of the lower powers and the given equations. Specifically, we use the relationships between the sums of the powers of \(x\) and \(y\) to find the required expression.
