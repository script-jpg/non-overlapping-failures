  Given the equations:
  1. \( ax + by = 3 \)
  2. \( ax^2 + by^2 = 7 \)
  3. \( ax^3 + by^3 = 16 \)
  4. \( ax^4 + by^4 = 42 \)
  We need to find \( ax^5 + by^5 \).
  First, we derive the values of higher powers of \( x \) and \( y \) by expressing them in terms of the lower powers and the given equations. Specifically, we use the relationships between the sums of the powers of \( x \) and \( y \) to find the value of \( ax^5 + by^5 \).
