  Given real numbers \(a\), \(b\), \(x\), and \(y\) that satisfy the following equations:
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  ax + by &= 3, \\
  ax^2 + by^2 &= 7, \\
  ax^3 + by^3 &= 16, \\
  ax^4 + by^4 &= 42,
  \end{align*}
  \]
  we need to find \(ax^5 + by^5\).
  By examining the given equations, we can observe that the sequence of sums of powers of \(x\) and \(y\) follows a pattern. Specifically, the sums of the first \(n\) powers of \(x\) and \(y\) can be expressed as:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} x^k = \frac{1 - x^n}{1 - x}
  \]
  and
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} y^k = \frac{1 - y^n}{1 - y}
  \]
  Given the values for the sums of the first four powers, we can use these to find the sum of the fifth power. By leveraging the properties of the sums and the given values, we can derive the required result.
