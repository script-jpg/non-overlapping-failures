  Given real numbers \(a, b, x, y\) that satisfy the following equations:
  1. \(ax + by = 3\)
  2. \(ax^2 + by^2 = 7\)
  3. \(ax^3 + by^3 = 16\)
  4. \(ax^4 + by^4 = 42\)
  We need to find \(ax^5 + by^5\).
  First, we derive the values of \(ax^6 + by^6\) and \(ax^4 + by^4\) using the given equations. By subtracting the equations, we can isolate terms involving \(x\) and \(y\). Using these values, we can compute \(ax^5 + by^5\).
