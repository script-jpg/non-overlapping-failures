  Given the real numbers \(a, b, x, y\) that satisfy the equations:
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  ax + by &= 3, \\
  ax^2 + by^2 &= 7, \\
  ax^3 + by^3 &= 16, \\
  ax^4 + by^4 &= 42,
  \end{align*}
  \]
  we need to find \(ax^5 + by^5\).
  First, we express \(x\) and \(y\) in terms of the given equations. By manipulating the equations, we can derive expressions for \(x\) and \(y\) that satisfy all the given conditions. Using these expressions, we can then compute \(ax^5 + by^5\).
