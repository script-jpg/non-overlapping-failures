-- We use the method of finite differences to solve this problem.

  -- First, we get the first order differences.
  have h₁' : a * x ^ 2 + b * y ^ 2 - (a * x + b * y) = 7 - 3 := by rw [h₀, h₁]
  have h₂' : a * x ^ 3 + b * y ^ 3 - (a * x ^ 2 + b * y ^ 2) = 16 - 7 := by rw [h₁, h₂]
  have h₃' : a * x ^ 4 + b * y ^ 4 - (a * x ^ 3 + b * y ^ 3) = 42 - 16 := by rw [h₂, h₃]

  -- Second order differences are:
  have h₂'' : a * x ^ 3 + b * y ^ 3 - 2 * (a * x ^ 2 + b * y ^ 2) + (a * x + b * y) = 16 - 2 * 7 := by rw [h₀, h₁, h₂]
  have h₃'' : a * x ^ 4 + b * y ^ 4 - 2 * (a * x ^ 3 + b * y ^ 3) + (a * x ^ 2 + b * y ^ 2) = 42 - 2 * 16 := by rw [h₁, h₂, h₃]

  -- Second order differences are constant, we can use that to compute the next one:
  have h₄'' : a * x ^ 5 + b * y ^ 5 - 2 * (a * x ^ 4 + b * y ^ 4) + (a * x ^ 3 + b * y ^ 3) = 20 - 2 * 42 := by
    linarith [h₂'', h₃'', h₃']

  -- Finally, we compute the answer
  linarith [h₄'']
