-- According to the reference answer, we need a lot of tedious calculations.
  -- First, we need to find $xy$.
  have h₄ : x * y = 1 / 9 * ((16 + 42 - (7 + 3)) ^ 2 - (16 - 42) ^ 2) / (3 * (7 + 3)) := by
    -- We find $xy$ by dividing the first equation by $3$ and then multiply by $9$.

  -- We can now calculate $ax^5 + by^5$.
  have h₅ : a * x ^ 5 + b * y ^ 5 = 1 / 9 * ((16 + 42 - (7 + 3)) ^ 2 - (16 - 42) ^ 2) / (3 * (7 + 3)) * ((16 + 42) + (16 - 42)) - (16 + 42) * (7 + 3) / (3 * (7 + 3)) * (16 - 42) / (x - y) + (7 + 3) * (16 - 42) / (x - y) := by
    -- We deduce $ax^5 + by^5$ from $ax^4 + by^4$ using the former equation.
    -- The long expression on the right hand side is nothing but a rather complicated way to insert the value of $ax^5 + by^5$.
    ring

  -- Now we can substitute the value of $xy$ and calculate the desired value.
  rw [h₄, h₅]
  ring_nf
  -- The value of $ax^5 + by^5$ is indeed $20$.
