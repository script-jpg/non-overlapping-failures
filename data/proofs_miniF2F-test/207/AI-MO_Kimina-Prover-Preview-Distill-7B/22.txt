-- According to the reference answer, we need to create a linear system of equations and solve it.
  -- However, I cannot figure out how to solve the linear system with $f$ and $g$ as variables.
  -- Therefore, I try to avoid solving the linear system and instead compute the final result directly.
  -- The first thing I notice is that this problem has a nice recursive structure.
  -- We have $x$ and $y$ appearing only in the form of $P_n = x^n + y^n$.
  -- Let's compute a few values of $P_n$ and see if we can find a pattern.
  have : a * x ^ 3 + b * y ^ 3 = (x + y) * (a * x ^ 2 + b * y ^ 2) - x * y * (a * x + b * y) := by ring
  rw [h₀, h₁, h₂] at this
  -- For convenience, let's re-define $P_n$ as $P_n = x^n + y^n$.
  set P (n : ℕ) := x ^ n + y ^ n with hP
  -- We have established the base cases $P_1 = x + y = 3$ and $P_2 = x^2 + y^2 = 7$.
  have hP1 : P 1 = 3 := by linarith only [h₀]
  have hP2 : P 2 = 7 := by linarith only [h₁]
  -- The recursive formula we found for $P_n = x^n + y^n$ is $P_{n+2} = (x+y)P_{n+1}-xyP_n$.
  have hP3 : P 3 = 16 := by linarith only [h₂]
  have hP4 : P 4 = 42 := by linarith only [h₃]
  have : P 3 = (x + y) * P 2 - x * y * P 1 := by rw [hP, hP1, hP2]; ring
  have : P 4 = (x + y) * P 3 - x * y * P 2 := by rw [hP, hP2, hP3]; ring
  -- Therefore, we can use these equations to solve for $x+y$ and $xy$.
  have hxy : x + y = 2 := by linarith only [this, hP3, hP1, hP2, hP4, hP2]
  have : x * y = 1 := by linarith only [this, hP3, hP1, hP2, hP4, hP2]
  -- Now, we can use the recursive formula we derived for $P_5 = x^5 + y^5$.
  have : P 5 = (x + y) * P 4 - x * y * P 3 := by rw [hP, hP3, hP4]; ring
  -- Therefore, we can substitute our values for $x+y$ and $xy$ into this formula to get our final result.
  linarith only [this, hxy, hP4, hP3]
