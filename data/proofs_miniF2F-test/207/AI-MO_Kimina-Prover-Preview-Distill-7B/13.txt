-- we prove that $T(n)$ equals $3$, $7$, $16$, $42$, $020$ for $n = 1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$ respectively.
  let T (n : ℕ) := a * x^(n + 1) + b * y^(n + 1)
  have h₀' : T 0 = 3 := by      simp [T]; exact h₀
  have h₁' : T 1 = 7  := by     simp [T]; exact h₁
  have h₂' : T 2 = 16 := by     simp [T]; exact h₂
  have h₃' : T 3 = 42 := by     simp [T]; exact h₃
  have h₄ : T 4 = 20 := by      simp [T]; linarith
  exact h₄
