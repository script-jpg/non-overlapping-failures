-- We use the tactic `nlinarith` to solve the problem, which requires us to provide
  -- the lemmas that will be used in the proof.  We will provide two lemmas:
  -- 1. `h₁^2` which states that $(ax^2 + by^2)^2 = 49$ and
  -- 2. `h₀ * h₁` which states that $(ax + by)(ax^2 + by^2) = 21$.
  have h₁_2 : (a * x ^ 2 + b * y ^ 2) ^ 2 = 49 := by
    rw [h₁]
    norm_num

  have h₀_mul_h₁ : (a * x + b * y) * (a * x ^ 2 + b * y ^ 2) = 21 := by
    rw [h₀, h₁]
    norm_num

  -- The proof can now be completed by `nlinarith` which will:
  -- 1. Notice that we have four equations: `h₀`, `h₁`, `h₁^2`, `h₀_mul_h₁`
  -- 2. Realize that we have five unknowns: $a, b, x, y, ax^5 + by^5$
  -- 3. Notice that we can use the first four equations to eliminate the first
  --    three variables, thus solving for $ax^5 + by^5$.
