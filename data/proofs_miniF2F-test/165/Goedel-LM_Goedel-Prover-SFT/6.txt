  To show that for any natural number \( n \), we have \( 11 \mid 10^n - (-1)^n \), we proceed by induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case: \( n = 0 \)**
  For \( n = 0 \), we have:
  \[ 10^0 - (-1)^0 = 1 - 1 = 0 \]
  Since \( 11 \mid 0 \), the base case holds.
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume that for some natural number \( k \), \( 11 \mid 10^k - (-1)^k \). We need to show that \( 11 \mid 10^{k+1} - (-1)^{k+1} \).
  First, express \( 10^{k+1} - (-1)^{k+1} \) in terms of \( 10^k - (-1)^k \):
  \[ 10^{k+1} - (-1)^{k+1} = 10 \cdot 10^k - (-1) \cdot (-1)^k \]
  \[ = 10 \cdot 10^k - 1 \cdot (-1)^k \]
  \[ = 10 \cdot 10^k + (-1)^k \]
  Using the inductive hypothesis \( 11 \mid 10^k - (-1)^k \), we can write:
  \[ 10^k - (-1)^k = 11m \]
  for some integer \( m \). Thus:
  \[ 10^{k+1} + (-1)^k = 10 \cdot 10^k + (-1)^k \]
  \[ = 10 \cdot (10^k - (-1)^k) + 11 \cdot (-1)^k \]
  \[ = 10 \cdot 11m + 11 \cdot (-1)^k \]
  \[ = 11 \cdot (10m - (-1)^k) \]
  Since \( 11 \mid 11 \cdot (10m - (-1)^k) \), it follows that \( 11 \mid 10^{k+1} - (-1)^{k+1} \).
  By induction, \( 11 \mid 10^n - (-1)^n \) for all natural numbers \( n \).
