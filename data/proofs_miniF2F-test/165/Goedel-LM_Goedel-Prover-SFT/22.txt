  We aim to show that for any natural number \( n \), \( 11 \) divides \( 10^n - (-1)^n \). We will use mathematical induction to prove this statement.
  **Base Case:**
  For \( n = 0 \), we have:
  \[ 10^0 - (-1)^0 = 1 - 1 = 0 \]
  Since \( 11 \) divides \( 0 \), the base case holds.
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume that for some natural number \( n \), \( 11 \) divides \( 10^n - (-1)^n \). We need to show that \( 11 \) divides \( 10^{n+1} - (-1)^{n+1} \).
  Consider:
  \[ 10^{n+1} - (-1)^{n+1} = 10 \cdot 10^n - (-1) \cdot (-1)^n \]
  Using the inductive hypothesis, we know that \( 11 \) divides \( 10^n - (-1)^n \). Let \( x \) be an integer such that:
  \[ 10^n - (-1)^n = 11x \]
  Then:
  \[ 10 \cdot 10^n - (-1) \cdot (-1)^n = 10 \cdot (11x + (-1)^n) - (-1) \cdot (-1)^n \]
  Simplifying further:
  \[ = 10 \cdot 11x + 10 \cdot (-1)^n + 1 \cdot (-1)^n \]
  \[ = 10 \cdot 11x + 1 \cdot (-1)^n \]
  Since \( 10 \cdot 11x \) is clearly divisible by \( 11 \), and \( 1 \cdot (-1)^n \) is also divisible by \( 11 \) (because \( (-1)^n \) is a power of \( -1 \) and thus divisible by \( 11 \)), we conclude that:
  \[ 11 \mid 10^{n+1} - (-1)^{n+1} \]
  By induction, \( 11 \) divides \( 10^n - (-1)^n \) for all natural numbers \( n \).
