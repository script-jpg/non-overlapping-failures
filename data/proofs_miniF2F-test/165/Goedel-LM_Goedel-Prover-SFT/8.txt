  To show that for any natural number \( n \), we have \( 11 \mid 10^n - (-1)^n \), we can use the property of divisibility and modular arithmetic. Specifically, we will demonstrate that \( 10^n - (-1)^n \) is congruent to 0 modulo 11. This can be achieved by examining the powers of 10 and -1 modulo 11 and observing the periodicity.
