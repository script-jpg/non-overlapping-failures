  To show that for any natural number \( n \), we have \( 11 \mid 10^n - (-1)^n \), we can use the property of divisibility and modular arithmetic. Specifically, we will show that \( 10^n - (-1)^n \) is congruent to 0 modulo 11. This can be achieved by examining the powers of 10 and \(-1\) modulo 11 and observing that they cycle in a way that simplifies the expression to 0 modulo 11.
