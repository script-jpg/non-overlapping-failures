# Solving the Number Theory Problem in Lean 4

I'll work through proving that for any natural number $n$, we have $11 \mid 10^n - (-1)^n$ using induction in Lean 4.

First, let's think about the mathematical proof. We need to prove that $11$ divides $10^n - (-1)^n$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. 

Let's start with the base case $n = 0$:
- When $n = 0$, we have $10^0 - (-1)^0 = 1 - 1 = 0$, and $11 \mid 0$ is true because $0$ is divisible by any non-zero integer.

Now for the inductive step: assuming $11 \mid 10^n - (-1)^n$, we need to show $11 \mid 10^{n+1} - (-1)^{n+1}$.

From $11 \mid 10^n - (-1)^n$, there exists some integer $k$ such that $10^n - (-1)^n = 11k$. 

Let's consider $10^{n+1} - (-1)^{n+1}$:
- $10^{n+1} - (-1)^{n+1} = 10 \cdot 10^n - (-1)^{n} \cdot (-1)$
- $= 10 \cdot 10^n + (-1)^n$
- $= 10 \cdot 10^n + (-1)^n$
- $= 10 \cdot (10^n - (-1)^n) + 10 \cdot (-1)^n + (-1)^n$
- $= 10 \cdot (10^n - (-1)^n) + 11 \cdot (-1)^n$

Since $10^n - (-1)^n = 11k$ by the induction hypothesis, we have:
$10^{n+1} - (-1)^{n+1} = 10 \cdot 11k + 11 \cdot (-1)^n = 11(10k + (-1)^n)$

Thus $11 \mid 10^{n+1} - (-1)^{n+1}$.

Now, let's translate this to Lean 4:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

We need to import the necessary libraries and set up the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem induction_11div10tonmn1ton (n : ℕ) : 11 ∣ 10 ^ n - (-1 : ℤ) ^ n := by
```

Now we'll prove this by induction on $n$.

For the base case $n = 0$:
- $10^0 - (-1)^0 = 1 - 1 = 0$, and $11 \mid 0$ is true.

For the inductive step, assuming $11 \mid 10^n - (-1)^n$, we need to show $11 \mid 10^{n+1} - (-1)^{n+1}$.

Let's complete the proof with Lean:

```tactics
| zero => simp
| succ n ih =>
  rw [pow_succ, pow_succ]
  rcases ih with ⟨m, hm⟩
  use 10 * m + (-1) ^ n
  linear_combination hm + (-1) ^ n * 11
```

This completes the proof. We've shown that $11 \mid 10^n - (-1)^n$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ using induction, which implies $11 \mid 10^n - 1$ when $n$ is even and $11 \mid 10^n + 1$ when $n$ is odd.
</- Show that for any natural number $n$, we have $11\mid 10^n-(-1)^n$.-/
