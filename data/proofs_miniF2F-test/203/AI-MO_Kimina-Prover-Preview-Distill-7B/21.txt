-- We use `norm_num` here because it can compute the value of `194 % 11`.

In Lean 4, the `norm_num` tactic is powerful enough to compute basic arithmetic facts like the remainder of a division. It will calculate $194 \div 11$ to find the quotient and remainder. The quotient is 17, and the remainder is 7, so $194 \equiv 7 \pmod{11}$.

To verify this manually: $194 = 11 \times 17 + 7$, where $11 \times 17 = 187$, and $194 - 187 = 7$. Since $0 \leq 7 < 11$, 7 is indeed the remainder when 194 is divided by 11.

The Lean proof is remarkably concise because Lean's computational engine can directly evaluate this arithmetic expression. The `norm_num` tactic is sufficient to prove this basic number theory fact, demonstrating Lean's capability to handle concrete arithmetic computations efficiently.
