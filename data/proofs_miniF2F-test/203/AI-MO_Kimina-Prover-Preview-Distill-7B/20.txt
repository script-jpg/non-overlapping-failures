-- Calculate the remainder of 194 when divided by 11

The completed proof is remarkably concise because Lean's `norm_num` tactic is powerful for arithmetic goals involving concrete numbers. This tactic is able to compute that 194 divided by 11 gives a quotient of 17 and a remainder of 7, therefore 194 ≡ 7 (mod 11).

To elaborate on why 194 % 11 = 7: When dividing 194 by 11, we find that 11 × 17 = 187, and 194 - 187 = 7. Since 7 is less than 11, it is the remainder. Thus, 194 ≡ 7 (mod 11).

The `norm_num` tactic is perfect for this kind of problem because it automatically computes arithmetic expressions with concrete values. It works for goals involving natural numbers, integers, and rational numbers, and can compute all the arithmetic operations we would do by hand, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.
