-- We use `norm_num` to compute the remainder of 194 divided by 11.
  norm_num
```

The complete formal solution is remarkably concise. We import the necessary libraries and then state the theorem. The proof is handled by Lean's `norm_num` tactic, which is powerful enough to compute arithmetic expressions like modular arithmetic.

To understand why 194 % 11 = 7, we can perform the division manually:
- 194 divided by 11 is approximately 17.636, so the quotient is 17.
- 11 multiplied by 17 is 187.
- Subtracting 187 from 194 gives us 7, which is the remainder.

Therefore, 194 ≡ 7 (mod 11), and our theorem is proven correctly by Lean's computational engine.
