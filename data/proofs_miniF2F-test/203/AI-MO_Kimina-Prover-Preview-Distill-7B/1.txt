# Solving the Number Theory Problem in Lean 4

We need to determine the remainder of 194 when divided by 11 and prove that it is 7. This is a fundamental modular arithmetic problem.

First, let's think about what we need to prove. The remainder of 194 when divided by 11 is the value `r` in the range `0 ≤ r < 11` such that `194 = 11 * q + r` for some integer `q`. 

To find this, we can perform the division:
- 194 ÷ 11 = 17 with remainder 7 because 11 * 17 = 187 and 194 - 187 = 7.

So we should have 194 % 11 = 7.

Now, let's translate this into Lean 4 code:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

We've imported the necessary libraries and opened namespaces for our work. The `maxHeartbeats 0` option allows Lean to work as long as needed, which is useful for computational problems like this one.

Now we'll define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_66 : 194 % 11 = 7 := by 
```

We have our theorem statement. In Lean, the modulus operation is represented by the `%` symbol, just as in many programming languages. 

To prove this, we need to show that 194 divided by 11 gives a remainder of 7. Lean has powerful computational capabilities, and for this simple arithmetic fact, we can use the `norm_num` tactic:

```tactics
norm_num
```

The `norm_num` tactic is designed to solve arithmetic goals by computation. It will evaluate the arithmetic expression `194 % 11` and verify that it equals 7. 

So our complete proof is:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat

theorem mathd_numbertheory_66 : 194 % 11 = 7 := by 
  norm_num
```

This proof is complete. The `norm_num` tactic performs the calculation that we did manually: it computes 194 divided by 11, which is 17 with remainder 7, and therefore confirms that 194 % 11 = 7.

The beauty of this problem is how Lean's automation can verify simple arithmetic facts that would otherwise require a manual calculation. For more complex number theory problems, Lean's proof automation can handle the computational steps as part of a larger proof structure.
