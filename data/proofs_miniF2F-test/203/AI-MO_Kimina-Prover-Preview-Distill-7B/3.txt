-- We use `norm_num` tactic to compute the remainder of 194 divided by 11.
  norm_num
```

The `norm_num` tactic is powerful enough to compute basic arithmetic facts like this one. When given the goal `194 % 11 = 7`, it will calculate `194 mod 11` and verify that it equals `7`. 

To understand why `194 % 11 = 7`, we can perform the division:
- `194 ÷ 11 ≈ 17.636` so the quotient is 17
- `11 × 17 = 187`
- `194 - 187 = 7`

Therefore, the remainder when 194 is divided by 11 is 7, which means `194 ≡ 7 (mod 11)`.

The Lean proof is complete with just the `norm_num` tactic, which confirms that the goal is indeed a basic arithmetic fact that can be verified computationally.
