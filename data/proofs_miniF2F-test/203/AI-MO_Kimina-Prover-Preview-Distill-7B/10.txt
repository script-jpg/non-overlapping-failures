-- We use `norm_num` tactic to compute the remainder of 194 divided by 11.
  norm_num
```

The `norm_num` tactic is powerful for arithmetic computations. It can compute the value of 194 mod 11 directly. To understand why 194 mod 11 equals 7, we can perform the division: 194 divided by 11 gives a quotient of 17 and a remainder of 7, since 194 = 11 * 17 + 7. Therefore, 194 % 11 = 7.

The reason we use `norm_num` here is that it automates the arithmetic computation, saving us from having to write out the detailed steps of division and remainder calculation that would be tedious in a formal proof. This tactic is perfect for straightforward arithmetic facts like this one.

So our complete formal proof is:

These imports and settings give us access to the necessary mathematical libraries and tools.

Now, let's define the theorem:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_66 : 194 % 11 = 7 := by
  norm_num
```

This theorem statement declares that the remainder of 194 divided by 11 equals 7. The proof is remarkably simple because `norm_num` can compute this arithmetic fact directly.

The `norm_num` tactic is handling all the computational work for us. It's calculating 194 divided by 11, determining the quotient and remainder, and verifying that the remainder is indeed 7. This is a direct computational proof of the fact.

In summary, our formal proof is complete. We've shown that 194 % 11 = 7 using Lean's computational capability. The key insight is that 194 = 11 * 17 + 7, so when we divide 194 by 11, the remainder is 7. The `norm_num` tactic is powerful for these kinds of arithmetic facts, as it can compute them directly without requiring us to write out the full inductive or axiomatic proof.
