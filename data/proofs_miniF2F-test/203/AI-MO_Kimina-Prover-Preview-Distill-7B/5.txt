# Finding the Remainder of 194 When Divided by 11

To find the remainder of 194 when divided by 11, we can perform the division and identify the remainder directly. 

First, let's think about the mathematical definition of division with remainder. For integers $a$ and $b$ where $b > 0$, there exist unique integers $q$ (quotient) and $r$ (remainder) such that $a = bq + r$ where $0 \leq r < b$. 

In our case, $a = 194$ and $b = 11$. We need to find $q$ and $r$ such that:
1. $194 = 11q + r$
2. $0 \leq r < 11$

Let's perform the division: 

1. Divide 194 by 11. 
2. 11 × 17 = 187 
3. 194 - 187 = 7 
4. So, $194 = 11 \times 17 + 7$ 
5. Therefore, the remainder is 7, which satisfies $0 \leq 7 < 11$.

In Lean 4, we can prove this as follows:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

```

Now we need to state the theorem:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_66 : 194 % 11 = 7 := by 
```

The theorem statement directly expresses what we need to prove: the remainder of 194 when divided by 11 is 7. 

To prove this in Lean, we can use the `rfl` tactic because the equality is a computational fact that Lean can verify directly:

```tactics
rfl
```

The `rfl` tactic (reflexivity) proves that two expressions are definitionally equal. In this case, Lean can compute both sides of the equation and verify they are equal. 

So our complete proof is:

1. We state the theorem: 194 % 11 = 7
2. We prove it using `rfl`, which computes both sides and checks they are equal

The Lean proof is remarkably concise because the statement is a direct computational fact. Lean's typechecker can compute arithmetic expressions like this one automatically. 

Therefore, the remainder when 194 is divided by 11 is indeed 7.
