-- We use the `norm_num` tactic to compute the remainder of 194 divided by 11.
  norm_num
```

The `norm_num` tactic is powerful for these types of arithmetic calculations. It automatically computes that $194 \div 11 = 17$ with a remainder of $7$, and therefore $194 \bmod 11 = 7$. This is exactly what we wanted to prove.
