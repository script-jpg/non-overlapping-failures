-- We use the `norm_num` tactic to compute the remainder of 194 divided by 11.
  norm_num
```

The `norm_num` tactic performs arithmetic calculations and simplifications. In this case, it computes that the remainder when 194 is divided by 11 is 7, which completes our proof.

To understand why 194 ≡ 7 (mod 11), we can also perform the division manually:
- 11 × 17 = 187
- 194 - 187 = 7

Therefore, 194 ≡ 7 (mod 11), and the remainder is 7.

The complete proof in Lean 4 is remarkably concise because Lean's computational capabilities can directly verify this arithmetic fact. The `norm_num` tactic is powerful for solving goals involving concrete numerical computations, as it can evaluate expressions and check equalities that would otherwise require manual calculation.
