This proof is straightforward because:
1. It directly computes the remainder of 194 divided by 11
2. It uses Lean's built-in computation capabilities (`norm_num`) to calculate the value
3. It verifies the result is indeed 7, which is the answer to the original question

The key insight is that when we divide 194 by 11, we get a quotient of 17 and a remainder of 7, since 194 = 11 * 17 + 7. The modulo operation returns this remainder.
