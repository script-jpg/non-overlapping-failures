The key insight is that to find the remainder of 194 when divided by 11, we need to calculate $194 \bmod 11$. This involves finding the largest multiple of 11 that is less than or equal to 194 and then subtracting it from 194 to find the remainder.

First, let's determine the quotient when 194 is divided by 11. We can do this by calculating:
- $194 \div 11 \approx 17.636$

So the quotient is 17. Now, we multiply 17 by 11 to find the largest multiple of 11 less than or equal to 194:
- $17 \times 11 = 187$

Now, we subtract 187 from 194 to find the remainder:
- $194 - 187 = 7$

Therefore, the remainder of 194 when divided by 11 is 7, or $194 \bmod 11 = 7$.

In Lean 4, we can prove this using the `norm_num` tactic, which is powerful for arithmetic goals. It can compute the value of $194 \bmod 11$ and verify that it equals 7:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

/-- Determine the remainder of 194 (mod 11). Show that it is 7.-/

theorem mathd_numbertheory_66 : 194 % 11 = 7 := by
  norm_num
```

The `norm_num` tactic is able to compute the modulus operation directly. It calculates that $194 \bmod 11 = 7$, which is exactly what we want to prove. This tactic is particularly useful for goals involving concrete arithmetic calculations, as it can evaluate them automatically.

So our complete proof is:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat


/-- Determine the remainder of 194 (mod 11). Show that it is 7.-/

theorem mathd_numbertheory_66 : 194 % 11 = 7 := by
  norm_num
```

This proof is remarkably concise because Lean's automation can handle simple arithmetic facts like this one directly, without requiring further breakdown of the calculation. The `norm_num` tactic is powerful enough to compute the exact value of $194 \bmod 11$ and verify that it is indeed 7.
