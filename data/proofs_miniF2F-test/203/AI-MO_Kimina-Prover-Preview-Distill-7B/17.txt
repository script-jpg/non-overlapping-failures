-- We use `norm_num` tactic to compute the remainder of 194 divided by 11.
  norm_num
```

When we divide 194 by 11, we get 17 as the quotient and 7 as the remainder. This is because 194 = 11 × 17 + 7. The remainder is 7, which is what we wanted to prove.

The `norm_num` tactic in Lean is powerful for arithmetic goals. It can compute arithmetic expressions and verify equalities involving concrete numbers. In this case, it calculates 194 % 11 (the remainder of 194 divided by 11) and checks that it equals 7.

So our complete proof is:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

We're importing the necessary libraries, setting an option to allow deep proof search, and opening namespaces for various mathematical components.

Now we'll define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_66 : 194 % 11 = 7 := by
  norm_num
```

And that's it! The proof is complete. The `norm_num` tactic automatically computes that 194 divided by 11 leaves a remainder of 7, confirming our goal.

This is a straightforward arithmetic fact, but in Lean, we need to explicitly calculate it. The `norm_num` tactic handles these kinds of calculations efficiently, verifying that 194 % 11 indeed equals 7.

Therefore, the remainder of 194 when divided by 11 is 7.
