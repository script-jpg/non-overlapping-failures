# Solving the Remainder Problem: 194 mod 11

To determine the remainder when 194 is divided by 11, we can perform the division and find the remainder directly. 

First, let's think about how to compute 194 mod 11. The modulus operation finds the remainder after division of one number by another. For positive integers, it's the remainder that is typically referred to.

Let's manually compute 194 divided by 11 to find the remainder:

194 ÷ 11 = 17 with a remainder of 7

To verify:
11 × 17 = 187
194 - 187 = 7

So indeed, 194 = 11 × 17 + 7

Since 0 ≤ 7 < 11, the remainder is 7.

In Lean 4, we can prove this as follows:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

Now we'll define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_66 : 194 % 11 = 7 := by
```

To prove this, we need to show that when 194 is divided by 11, the remainder is 7. The Lean proof is straightforward since this is a computational fact that can be verified directly by Lean's computation engine.

We can complete the proof with the `norm_num` tactic, which is powerful enough to compute arithmetic goals involving concrete numbers:

```tactics
norm_num
```

The `norm_num` tactic will compute 194 mod 11 directly. It will determine that 194 = 11 × 17 + 7, so the remainder is 7. Since the goal is a simple arithmetic equality of concrete values, Lean's computation infrastructure can verify it directly without further proof steps.

So the complete proof is:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat

theorem mathd_numbertheory_66 : 194 % 11 = 7 := by 
  norm_num
```

This elegant proof demonstrates how Lean's automation can handle simple arithmetic goals efficiently, verifying that 194 mod 11 is indeed 7.
