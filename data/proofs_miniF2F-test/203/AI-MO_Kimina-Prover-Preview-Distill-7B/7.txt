-- We use the definition of mod and apply the division algorithm to the integers 194 and 11.
  -- According to the definition of division with remainder, we have: 194 = 11 * 17 + 11 * 7.
  have h1 : 194 = 11 * 17 + 11 * 7 := by norm_num

  -- The above equation implies that the remainder of 194 divided by 11 is 7.
