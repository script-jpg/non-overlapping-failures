The problem asks us to determine the remainder of 194 when divided by 11, and to show that it is 7. This is a straightforward modular arithmetic problem. 

To solve it manually: 
- Divide 194 by 11. 
- 11 × 17 = 187 
- 194 - 187 = 7 
- Therefore, the remainder of 194 when divided by 11 is 7. 

In Lean, the `norm_num` tactic is powerful enough to compute this directly. When invoked, `norm_num` performs arithmetic operations including modulus. It will compute 194 % 11 and verify that it equals 7. This tactic essentially acts as a calculator within Lean's proof framework.

So our complete proof is:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

```

We've imported the necessary libraries, set an option to ensure thorough computation, and opened namespaces for various mathematical components. 

Now, let's define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_66 : 194 % 11 = 7 := by 
  norm_num
```

The theorem statement directly expresses our goal: to prove that 194 % 11 = 7. The `norm_num` tactic is then used to automatically compute the modulus operation and verify that the result is indeed 7. 

This proof is elegant in its simplicity. The Lean proof system is able to verify basic arithmetic facts like this one without requiring further proof steps, as the computation is direct and Lean's automated tactics can handle it efficiently.
