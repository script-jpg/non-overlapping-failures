The key insight for this problem is understanding the definition of the modulo operation. The remainder of 194 when divided by 11 is the unique number $r$ such that $0 \leq r < 11$ and $194 = 11q + r$ for some integer $q$. By performing the division, we find that $194 = 11 \cdot 17 + 7$, so the remainder is 7. The Lean proof directly computes this by rewriting the modulo operation and verifying the inequality conditions.
To determine the remainder of 194 when divided by 11, we can use the definition of the modulo operation. The remainder is the unique number $r$ such that $0 \leq r < 11$ and $194 = 11q + r$ for some integer $q$.

First, let's find the quotient $q$ when 194 is divided by 11. 

$194 \div 11 \approx 17.6327$, so the integer part is 17. Thus, $q = 17$.

Now, we can calculate $r$ as follows:

$r = 194 - 11 \cdot q = 194 - 11 \cdot 17 = 194 - 187 = 7$.

Therefore, the remainder is 7.

In Lean 4, we can prove this as follows:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

We start by importing the necessary libraries and setting up the basic framework. We need Mathlib for number theory functions and Aesop for automated proof capabilities. We also open several namespaces to access the necessary definitions and theorems.

Now, let's define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_66 : 194 % 11 = 7 := by
```

We have stated the theorem. Now we need to prove it. The remainder operation in Lean is defined as the unique number $r$ such that $0 \leq r < n$ and $a = nq + r$ for some integer $q$. 

To prove that $194 \% 11 = 7$, we need to show:
1. $0 \leq 7 < 11$ (which is true)
2. $194 = 11 \cdot q + 7$ for some integer $q$ (with $q = 17$, since $194 = 11 \cdot 17 + 7$)

Let's complete the proof:

```tactics
norm_num
```

The `norm_num` tactic is powerful enough to compute this arithmetic fact directly. It will:
1. Calculate $194 \div 11 = 17$ (integer division)
2. Calculate $194 - 11 \cdot 17 = 7$
3. Verify that $0 \leq 7 < 11$

Therefore, the remainder of 194 when divided by 11 is indeed 7, as our theorem states.
