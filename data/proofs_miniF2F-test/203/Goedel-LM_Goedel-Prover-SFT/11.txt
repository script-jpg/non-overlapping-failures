  To determine the remainder of 194 when divided by 11, we can use the modulo operation. The modulo operation calculates the remainder of the division of one number by another. In this case, we need to find \( 194 \mod 11 \).
  First, we perform the division of 194 by 11:
  \[ 194 \div 11 = 17 \text{ remainder } 7 \]
  This division tells us that:
  \[ 194 = 11 \times 17 + 7 \]
  Thus, the remainder when 194 is divided by 11 is 7. Therefore, we have:
  \[ 194 \mod 11 = 7 \]
  -/
  -- Use the `norm_num` tactic to compute the remainder of 194 divided by 11.
  norm_num
  -- The `norm_num` tactic will simplify the expression and directly compute the remainder, which is 7.
