  To determine the remainder of 194 when divided by 11, we can use modular arithmetic. We need to show that \( 194 \mod 11 = 7 \). This can be verified directly by checking the congruence:
  \[ 194 \div 11 = 17 \text{ remainder } 7 \]
  Since \( 194 = 11 \times 17 + 7 \), it follows that \( 194 \mod 11 = 7 \).
