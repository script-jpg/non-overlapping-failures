  To determine the remainder of 194 when divided by 11, we can use the properties of modular arithmetic. Specifically, we can break down the number 194 into a sum of multiples of 11 and then find the remainder of the sum.
  1. First, we note that \( 194 = 17 \times 11 + 7 \).
  2. Since \( 17 \times 11 \) is a multiple of 11, it leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by 11.
  3. Therefore, the remainder of 194 when divided by 11 is the same as the remainder of 7 when divided by 11.
  4. Since 7 is less than 11, the remainder of 7 when divided by 11 is 7.
  Thus, the remainder of 194 when divided by 11 is 7.
