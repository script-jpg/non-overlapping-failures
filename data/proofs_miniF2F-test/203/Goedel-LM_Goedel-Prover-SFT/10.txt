  To determine the remainder of 194 when divided by 11, we can use the property of modular arithmetic. Specifically, we need to show that \( 194 \mod 11 = 7 \). This can be achieved by verifying that 194 is congruent to 7 modulo 11. We can do this by checking that the difference between 194 and 7 is divisible by 11.

  -- Use the simplification tactic to directly compute the remainder of 194 divided by 11.
  simp [Nat.mod_eq_of_lt, show 194 % 11 < 11 from by decide]
  -- Explanation:
  -- 1. `Nat.mod_eq_of_lt` is a lemma that states if the remainder is less than the divisor, then the result is the remainder.
  -- 2. `show 194 % 11 < 11 from by decide` proves that the remainder of 194 divided by 11 is less than 11, which is trivially true.
  -- 3. `simp` simplifies the expression using the lemma and the proof, confirming that 194 % 11 = 7.
