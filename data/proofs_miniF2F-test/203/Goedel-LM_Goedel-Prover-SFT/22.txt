  To determine the remainder of 194 when divided by 11, we can use the properties of modular arithmetic. Specifically, we can break down the number 194 into simpler components and then compute the remainders modulo 11.
  1. First, we express 194 as a sum of multiples of 11 and a remainder.
  2. We then compute the remainders of each component modulo 11.
  3. Finally, we sum these remainders to get the remainder of 194 modulo 11.
