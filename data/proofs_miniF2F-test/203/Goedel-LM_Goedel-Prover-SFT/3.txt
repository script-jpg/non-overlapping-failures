  To determine the remainder of 194 when divided by 11, we can use the property of modular arithmetic. Specifically, we need to compute \( 194 \mod 11 \). By performing the division, we find that:
  \[ 194 \div 11 = 17 \text{ remainder } 7 \]
  This calculation shows that the remainder is 7. Therefore, we have:
  \[ 194 \mod 11 = 7 \]
