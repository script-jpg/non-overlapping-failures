  To determine the remainder of 194 when divided by 11, we can use the modulo operation. The modulo operation calculates the remainder of the division of one number by another. In this case, we need to compute \( 194 \mod 11 \).
  First, we perform the division of 194 by 11:
  \[ 194 \div 11 = 17 \text{ remainder } 7 \]
  This can be verified by the equation:
  \[ 194 = 11 \times 17 + 7 \]
  Thus, the remainder when 194 is divided by 11 is 7.
