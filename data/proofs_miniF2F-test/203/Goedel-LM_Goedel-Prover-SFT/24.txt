  To determine the remainder of 194 when divided by 11, we can use the property of modular arithmetic. Specifically, we need to show that 194 modulo 11 equals 7. This can be verified by checking that 194 is less than 200 (which is 11 times 18 plus 2) and then finding the remainder of 194 divided by 11.

  -- Use the simplification tactic to directly compute the remainder of 194 divided by 11.
  simp [Nat.mod_eq_of_lt, show 194 < 200 by norm_num]
  -- The `norm_num` tactic will verify that 194 is indeed less than 200, and thus the remainder of 194 divided by 11 is 7.
