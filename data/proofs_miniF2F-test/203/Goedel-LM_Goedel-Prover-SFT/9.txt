  To determine the remainder of 194 when divided by 11, we can use the properties of modular arithmetic. Specifically, we can find the remainder by performing the division and noting the result.
  1. Calculate \( 194 \div 11 \):
     \[
     194 \div 11 = 17 \text{ remainder } 7
     \]
     This calculation shows that:
     \[
     194 = 11 \times 17 + 7
     \]
  2. Therefore, the remainder when 194 is divided by 11 is 7.
