  To determine the remainder of 194 when divided by 11, we can use the property of modular arithmetic. Specifically, we need to find \( 194 \mod 11 \). We can break down 194 into a sum of multiples of 11 and a remainder. 
  First, we find the largest multiple of 11 less than or equal to 194. This is 192, as \( 192 = 11 \times 18 \). 
  Next, we subtract this largest multiple from 194:
  \[ 194 - 192 = 2 \]
  Thus, the remainder when 194 is divided by 11 is 2.
