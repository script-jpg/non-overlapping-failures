  To determine the remainder of 194 when divided by 11, we can use the property of modular arithmetic. Specifically, we need to find \( 194 \mod 11 \). By performing the division, we can see that:
  \[ 194 \div 11 = 17 \text{ remainder } 7 \]
  This is because:
  \[ 194 = 11 \times 17 + 7 \]
  Thus, the remainder when 194 is divided by 11 is 7.
