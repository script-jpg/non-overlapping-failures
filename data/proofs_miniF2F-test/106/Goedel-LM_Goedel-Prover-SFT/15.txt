  To determine all real numbers \( x \) that satisfy the inequality:
  \[
  \sqrt{\sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1}} > \frac{1}{2}
  \]
  we need to show that it is equivalent to the interval:
  \[
  \left[ -1, 1 - \frac{\sqrt{127}}{32} \right).
  \]
  Given the constraints \( 0 \leq 3 - x \) and \( 0 \leq x + 1 \), we can use these to establish the bounds on \( x \). The inequality \( \frac{1}{2} < \sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1} \) provides the necessary conditions for \( x \) to be within the specified interval.

  -- We need to show that x is within the interval [-1, 1 - sqrt(31)/8).
  -- This involves proving two inequalities: -1 ≤ x and x < 1 - sqrt(31)/8.

  -- First, prove -1 ≤ x.
  -- Using the fact that 0 ≤ 3 - x and 0 ≤ x + 1, we can infer that x must be at least -1.
