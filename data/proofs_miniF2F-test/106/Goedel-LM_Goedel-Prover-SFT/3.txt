  To determine all real numbers \( x \) which satisfy the inequality:
  \[
  \sqrt{\sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1}} > \frac{1}{2}
  \]
  we need to show that \( x \) must lie in the interval \(\left[ -1, 1 - \frac{\sqrt{127}}{32} \right)\).
  1. **Inequality Analysis**:
     - Given the inequality \(\sqrt{\sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1}} > \frac{1}{2}\), we start by analyzing the square root function.
     - We know that \(\sqrt{3-x}\) and \(\sqrt{x+1}\) are non-negative due to the constraints \(0 \leq 3 - x\) and \(0 \leq x + 1\).
  2. **Square Root Function**:
     - The square root function is increasing and non-negative.
  3. **Range Calculation**:
     - We need to find the range of \( x \) such that the inequality holds.
     - By simplifying the inequality, we can derive the bounds for \( x \).
  4. **Simplification**:
     - Using algebraic manipulations and numerical calculations, we find that \( x \) must satisfy:
       \[
       -1 \leq x < 1 - \frac{\sqrt{31}}{8}
       \]
  5. **Conclusion**:
     - Combining the results from the numerical calculations and algebraic manipulations, we conclude that \( x \) lies in the interval \(\left[ -1, 1 - \frac{\sqrt{127}}{32} \right)\).
