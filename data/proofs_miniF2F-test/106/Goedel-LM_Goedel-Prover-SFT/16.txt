  To determine all real numbers \( x \) that satisfy the inequality \(\sqrt{\sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1}} > \frac{1}{2}\), we need to show that it is equivalent to the interval \([-1, 1 - \frac{\sqrt{127}}{32}]\).
  1. **Square both sides of the inequality**: This step is crucial as it simplifies the expression and allows us to compare the terms directly.
  2. **Establish the bounds on \( x \)**: By analyzing the inequality, we can determine the range of \( x \) that satisfies the given inequality.
  3. **Verify the bounds**: Ensure that the bounds \([-1, 1 - \frac{\sqrt{127}}{32}]\) are consistent with the inequality.
