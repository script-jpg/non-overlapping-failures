  To determine all real numbers \( x \) that satisfy the inequality \(\sqrt{\sqrt{3-x}-\sqrt{x+1}} > \frac{1}{2}\), we need to show that it is equivalent to the interval \([-1, 1 - \frac{\sqrt{127}}{32})\).
  1. **Non-negativity of the square root**: We start by noting that the square root function is non-negative, so \(\sqrt{3-x} \geq 0\) and \(\sqrt{x+1} \geq 0\).
  2. **Simplifying the inequality**: Given \(\sqrt{\sqrt{3-x}-\sqrt{x+1}} > \frac{1}{2}\), we can square both sides to eliminate the square root:
     \[
     \sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1} > \frac{1}{4}
     \]
  3. **Solving the inequality**: We need to solve for \( x \) in the interval \([-1, 1 - \frac{\sqrt{127}}{32})\). By simplifying and using the given conditions, we can derive the bounds for \( x \).
