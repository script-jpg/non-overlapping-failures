  To determine all real numbers \( x \) that satisfy the inequality \( \sqrt{\sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1}} > \frac{1}{2} \), we need to analyze the conditions under which the expression inside the square root is non-negative and the inequality holds.
  1. **Non-negativity of the expression inside the square root**:
     - For \( \sqrt{3-x} \) to be non-negative, \( 3 - x \geq 0 \).
     - For \( \sqrt{x+1} \) to be non-negative, \( x + 1 \geq 0 \).
  2. **Inequality analysis**:
     - Given \( \sqrt{\sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1}} > \frac{1}{2} \), we can square both sides to eliminate the square root:
       \[
       \sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1} > \frac{1}{4}
       \]
     - Rearranging this inequality:
       \[
       \sqrt{3-x} - \frac{1}{4} > \sqrt{x+1}
       \]
     - Squaring both sides again:
       \[
       3 - x - \frac{1}{16} > x + 1
       \]
     - Simplifying:
       \[
       3 - x - \frac{1}{16} > x + 1 \implies 3 - 1 - \frac{1}{16} > 2x \implies 2 - \frac{1}{16} > 2x \implies 2 > 2x + \frac{1}{16}
       \]
     - Solving for \( x \):
       \[
       2 > 2x + \frac{1}{16} \implies 2 - \frac{1}{16} > 2x \implies \frac{32}{16} - \frac{1}{16} > 2x \implies \frac{31}{16} > 2x \implies x < \frac{31}{32}
       \]
  Thus, the solution to the inequality is \( x < \frac{31}{32} \).
