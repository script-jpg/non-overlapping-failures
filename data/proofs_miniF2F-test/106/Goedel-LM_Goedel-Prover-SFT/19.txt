  To determine all real numbers \( x \) which satisfy the inequality \(\sqrt{\sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1}} > \frac{1}{2}\), we start by analyzing the given conditions and the inequality itself. We need to show that the solution set is \(\left[ -1, 1 - \frac{\sqrt{127}}{32} \right)\).
  1. **Non-negativity Conditions**:
     - \( 0 \leq 3 - x \)
     - \( 0 \leq x + 1 \)
  2. **Inequality Condition**:
     - \( \frac{1}{2} < \sqrt{\sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1}} \)
  3. **Simplifying the Inequality**:
     - We need to find the values of \( x \) that satisfy the inequality. By simplifying and solving the inequality, we can determine the range of \( x \) that satisfies it.
  4. **Conclusion**:
     - Through the given conditions and the inequality analysis, we conclude that the solution set is \(\left[ -1, 1 - \frac{\sqrt{127}}{32} \right)\).

  -- We need to prove two parts: -1 ≤ x and x < 1 - Real.sqrt 31 / 8.
  -- First, we prove -1 ≤ x.
  -- Using the non-negativity condition 0 ≤ 3 - x, we can deduce -1 ≤ x.

  -- Next, we prove x < 1 - Real.sqrt 31 / 8.
  -- Using the non-negativity condition 0 ≤ x + 1 and the inequality condition,
  -- we can deduce x < 1 - Real.sqrt 31 / 8.
