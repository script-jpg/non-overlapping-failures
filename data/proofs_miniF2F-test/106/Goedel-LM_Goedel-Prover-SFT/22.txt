  To determine all real numbers \( x \) that satisfy the inequality \(\sqrt{\sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1}} > \frac{1}{2}\), we start by analyzing the given inequality. We need to find the range of \( x \) that satisfies the inequality.
  1. **Non-negativity of the terms**: Since \( 0 \leq 3 - x \) and \( 0 \leq x + 1 \), the square roots \(\sqrt{3-x}\) and \(\sqrt{x+1}\) are non-negative.
  2. **Simplifying the inequality**: We can rewrite the inequality as \(\sqrt{\sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1}} > \frac{1}{2}\).
  3. **Square both sides**: To eliminate the square root, we square both sides of the inequality, leading to \((\sqrt{\sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1}})^2 > \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2\).
  4. **Simplify the squared expressions**: Simplifying the squared expressions, we get \(\sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1} > \frac{1}{4}\).
  5. **Solving the inequality**: We need to solve \(\sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1} > \frac{1}{4}\) for \( x \).
  6. **Using the properties of square roots**: The solution involves using the properties of square roots and algebraic manipulations to find the range of \( x \) that satisfies the inequality.
