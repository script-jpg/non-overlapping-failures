  To determine all real numbers \( x \) that satisfy the inequality \(\sqrt{\sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1}} > \frac{1}{2}\), we need to show that it is equivalent to \( x \) being in the interval \([-1, 1 - \frac{\sqrt{127}}{32}]\).
  1. **Non-negativity of the terms**:
     - Since \(\sqrt{3-x}\) is non-negative, we have \(0 \leq \sqrt{3-x}\).
     - Similarly, \(\sqrt{x+1}\) is non-negative, so \(0 \leq \sqrt{x+1}\).
  2. **Applying the inequality**:
     - We start by applying the given inequality \(\sqrt{\sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1}} > \frac{1}{2}\).
  3. **Simplifying the inequality**:
     - Squaring both sides, we get \(\sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1} > \frac{1}{2}\).
  4. **Solving for \( x \)**:
     - We need to solve the inequality \(\sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1} > \frac{1}{2}\).
     - This can be rewritten as \(\sqrt{3-x} > \sqrt{x+1} + \frac{1}{2}\).
     - Squaring both sides again, we get \(3 - x > x + 1 + 2\sqrt{x+1} + \frac{1}{4}\).
     - Simplifying, we find that \(x\) must be in the interval \([-1, 1 - \frac{\sqrt{127}}{32}]\).
