  To determine all real numbers \( x \) that satisfy the inequality \( \sqrt{\sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1}} > \frac{1}{2} \), we need to show that it is equivalent to the interval \([-1, 1 - \frac{\sqrt{127}}{32})\).
  Given the conditions:
  1. \( 0 \leq 3 - x \)
  2. \( 0 \leq x + 1 \)
  3. \( \frac{1}{2} < \sqrt{\sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1}} \)
  We need to prove that \( -1 \leq x \) and \( x < 1 - \frac{\sqrt{127}}{32} \).
