  To determine all real numbers \( x \) which satisfy the inequality \(\sqrt{\sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1}} > \frac{1}{2}\), we need to show that the solution set is \([-1, 1 - \frac{\sqrt{127}}{32}]\).
  1. **Non-negativity of the terms**: Since \(\sqrt{3-x}\) and \(\sqrt{x+1}\) are square roots of non-negative numbers, they are non-negative.
  2. **Non-negativity of the difference**: The expression \(\sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1}\) is non-negative because both \(\sqrt{3-x}\) and \(\sqrt{x+1}\) are non-negative.
  3. **Applying the square root inequality**: The inequality \(\sqrt{\sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1}} > \frac{1}{2}\) implies that \(\sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1} > \frac{1}{4}\).
  4. **Solving the inequality**: By solving the inequality \(\sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1} > \frac{1}{4}\), we find that \(x\) must satisfy both \(x \geq -1\) and \(x < 1 - \frac{\sqrt{127}}{32}\).
