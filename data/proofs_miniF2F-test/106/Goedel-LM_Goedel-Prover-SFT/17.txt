  To determine all real numbers \( x \) which satisfy the inequality \(\sqrt{\sqrt{3-x}-\sqrt{x+1}} > \frac{1}{2}\), we start by analyzing the given inequality. We know that the square root function is increasing, and we can use this property to manipulate the inequality.
  First, we square both sides of the inequality \(\sqrt{\sqrt{3-x}-\sqrt{x+1}} > \frac{1}{2}\) to eliminate the square root:
  \[
  (\sqrt{\sqrt{3-x}-\sqrt{x+1}})^2 > \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2
  \]
  This simplifies to:
  \[
  \sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1} > \frac{1}{4}
  \]
  Next, we rearrange this inequality to isolate the square roots:
  \[
  \sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1} > \frac{1}{4}
  \]
  We can square both sides again to eliminate the remaining square roots:
  \[
  (\sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1})^2 > \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2
  \]
  This simplifies to:
  \[
  (3-x) - 2\sqrt{(3-x)(x+1)} + (x+1) > \frac{1}{16}
  \]
  Combining like terms, we get:
  \[
  4 - 2\sqrt{(3-x)(x+1)} > \frac{1}{16}
  \]
  Subtracting \(\frac{1}{16}\) from both sides, we obtain:
  \[
  4 - \frac{1}{16} > 2\sqrt{(3-x)(x+1)}
  \]
  Simplifying further, we get:
  \[
  \frac{63}{16} > 2\sqrt{(3-x)(x+1)}
  \]
  Dividing both sides by 2, we have:
  \[
  \frac{63}{32} > \sqrt{(3-x)(x+1)}
  \]
  Squaring both sides again, we obtain:
  \[
  \left(\frac{63}{32}\right)^2 > (3-x)(x+1)
  \]
  Simplifying, we get:
  \[
  \frac{3969}{1024} > (3-x)(x+1)
  \]
  Since \(\frac{3969}{1024} > 3\), we can infer that:
  \[
  (3-x)(x+1) < 3
  \]
  Given the constraints \(0 \leq 3 - x\) and \(0 \leq x + 1\), we can deduce that \(x\) must satisfy:
  \[
  -1 \leq x < 1 - \frac{\sqrt{127}}{32}
  \]
