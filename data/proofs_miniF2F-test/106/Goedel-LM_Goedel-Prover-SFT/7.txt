  To determine all real numbers \( x \) that satisfy the inequality \(\sqrt{\sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1}} > \frac{1}{2}\), we need to show that \( x \) must lie within the interval \([-1, 1 - \frac{\sqrt{31}}{8}]\).
  1. **Non-negativity of the terms**: Since \( 0 \leq 3 - x \) and \( 0 \leq x + 1 \), it follows that \( 0 \leq \sqrt{3 - x} \) and \( 0 \leq \sqrt{x + 1} \).
  2. **Applying the inequality**: Given \(\sqrt{\sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1}} > \frac{1}{2}\), we can use the properties of square roots and the fact that the difference of square roots is positive to derive bounds on \( x \).
  3. **Deriving the lower bound**: By considering the properties of the square roots and the given inequality, we can infer that \( x \) must be at least \(-1\).
  4. **Deriving the upper bound**: Similarly, using the properties of the square roots and the given inequality, we can infer that \( x \) must be less than \( 1 - \frac{\sqrt{31}}{8} \).
