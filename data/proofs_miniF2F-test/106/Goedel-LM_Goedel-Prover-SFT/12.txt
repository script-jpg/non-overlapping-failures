  To determine all real numbers \( x \) which satisfy the inequality \(\sqrt{\sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1}} > \frac{1}{2}\), we start by analyzing the given conditions and the inequality. We know that the inequality implies \( \sqrt{3 - x} - \sqrt{x + 1} > \frac{1}{2} \). We need to show that this inequality holds if and only if \( x \) is within the interval \([-1, 1 - \frac{\sqrt{127}}{32}]\).
  Given the conditions \( 0 \leq 3 - x \) and \( 0 \leq x + 1 \), we can infer that \( x \) must be non-negative and less than or equal to 3. The inequality \(\sqrt{\sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1}} > \frac{1}{2}\) implies that the difference between the square roots must be greater than \(\frac{1}{2}\).
  To solve this, we use the fact that the square root function is increasing and that the difference of square roots can be expressed in terms of a single square root. We then simplify the inequality and solve for \( x \) to find that \( x \) must satisfy \( -1 \leq x < 1 - \frac{\sqrt{31}}{8} \).

  -- We start by proving the lower bound for x.
  have h₃ : -1 ≤ x := by
    -- Using the fact that the square root of a non-negative number is non-negative,
    -- we can infer that x must be non-negative.
    have h₄ := Real.sqrt_nonneg (3 - x)
    have h₅ := Real.sqrt_nonneg (x + 1)
    -- By the properties of square roots and the given inequality,
    -- we can deduce that x must be at least -1.
    nlinarith [sq_sqrt (by linarith : 0 ≤ 3 - x), sq_sqrt (by linarith : 0 ≤ x + 1)]
  -- Next, we prove the upper bound for x.
  have h₄ : x < 1 - Real.sqrt 31 / 8 := by
    -- Using the properties of square roots and the given inequality,
    -- we can deduce that x must be less than 1 - sqrt(31) / 8.
    have h₅ := Real.sqrt_nonneg 31
    nlinarith [sq_sqrt (by linarith : (0 : ℝ) ≤ 31),
      sq_sqrt (by linarith : (0 : ℝ) ≤ 3 - x),
      sq_sqrt (by linarith : (0 : ℝ) ≤ x + 1)]
  -- Combining the lower and upper bounds,
  -- we conclude that x is in the interval [-1, 1 - sqrt(31) / 8].
