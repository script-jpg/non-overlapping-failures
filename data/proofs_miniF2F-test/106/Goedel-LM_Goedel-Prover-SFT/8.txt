  To determine all real numbers \( x \) that satisfy the inequality \( \sqrt{\sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1}} > \frac{1}{2} \), we need to show that the solution set is \( \left[ -1, 1 - \frac{\sqrt{127}}{32} \right) \).
  1. **Non-negativity of the terms**: Since \( \sqrt{3-x} \) and \( \sqrt{x+1} \) are square roots of non-negative numbers, they are non-negative.
  2. **Non-negativity of the difference**: The expression \( \sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1} \) is non-negative because it is a non-negative number.
  3. **Applying the square root inequality**: Given \( \sqrt{\sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1}} > \frac{1}{2} \), we can infer that \( \sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1} > \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} \).
  4. **Solving the inequality**: By solving \( \sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1} > \frac{1}{4} \), we find that \( x \) must satisfy \( -1 \leq x < 1 - \frac{\sqrt{31}}{8} \).
