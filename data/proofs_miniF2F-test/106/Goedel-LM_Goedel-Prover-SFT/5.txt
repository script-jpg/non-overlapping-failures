  To determine all real numbers \( x \) which satisfy the inequality:
  \[
  \sqrt{\sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1}} > \frac{1}{2}
  \]
  we need to show that \( x \) must lie in the interval \([-1, 1 - \frac{\sqrt{127}}{32}]\).
  Given the constraints \( 0 \leq 3 - x \) and \( 0 \leq x + 1 \), we can infer that \( x \leq 3 \) and \( x \geq -1 \). The inequality \( \frac{1}{2} < \sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1} \) implies that the difference between the square roots is greater than \(\frac{1}{2}\).
  To prove the interval, we start by considering the lower bound. We need to show that \( -1 \leq x \). This follows directly from the fact that \( \sqrt{3-x} \) and \( \sqrt{x+1} \) are non-negative and the inequality \( \frac{1}{2} < \sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1} \) implies that \( x \) is at least \(-1\).
  For the upper bound, we need to show that \( x < 1 - \frac{\sqrt{127}}{32} \). This can be derived from the fact that the maximum value of \( \sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1} \) is less than \(\frac{1}{2}\), and thus \( x \) must be less than \( 1 - \frac{\sqrt{127}}{32} \).

  -- To show -1 ≤ x, we use the fact that the square roots are non-negative.
  -- The inequality 1/2 < Real.sqrt (3 - x) - Real.sqrt (x + 1) implies that x ≥ -1.
