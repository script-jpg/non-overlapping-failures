  To determine all real numbers \( x \) that satisfy the inequality \( \sqrt{\sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1}} > \frac{1}{2} \), we need to show that this inequality holds if and only if \( x \) is in the interval \([-1, 1 - \frac{\sqrt{127}}{32}]\).
  Given the inequality \( \sqrt{\sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1}} > \frac{1}{2} \), we can square both sides to eliminate the square root:
  \[
  (\sqrt{\sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1}})^2 > \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2
  \]
  This simplifies to:
  \[
  \sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1} > \frac{1}{4}
  \]
  Next, we need to solve for \( x \) such that this inequality holds. We will use the properties of square roots and algebraic manipulations to find the range of \( x \).
