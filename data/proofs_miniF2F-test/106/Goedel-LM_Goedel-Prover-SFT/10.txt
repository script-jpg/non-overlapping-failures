  To determine all real numbers \( x \) which satisfy the inequality 
  \[
  \sqrt{\sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1}} > \frac{1}{2},
  \]
  we need to show that \( x \) must lie in the interval \([-1, 1 - \frac{\sqrt{127}}{32}]\).
  Given the conditions:
  1. \( 0 \leq 3 - x \)
  2. \( 0 \leq x + 1 \)
  3. \( \frac{1}{2} < \sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1} \)
  We will use these conditions to derive the bounds for \( x \).
  First, we note that the square root function is non-negative, so:
  \[
  0 \leq \sqrt{3-x} \quad \text{and} \quad 0 \leq \sqrt{x+1}
  \]
  From the third condition, we have:
  \[
  \frac{1}{2} < \sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1}
  \]
  This implies that the difference between the square roots is positive and greater than \(\frac{1}{2}\).
  To find the bounds for \( x \), we can use the fact that the square root function is increasing and that the difference of square roots is positive. We will use the inequalities derived from the square roots to establish the bounds for \( x \).
