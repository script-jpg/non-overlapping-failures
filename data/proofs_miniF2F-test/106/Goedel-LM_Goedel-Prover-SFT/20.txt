  To determine all real numbers \( x \) which satisfy the inequality \(\sqrt{\sqrt{3-x}-\sqrt{x+1}}>\dfrac{1}{2}\), we need to show that \( x \) lies in the interval \([-1, 1 - \frac{\sqrt{127}}{32}]\).
  1. **Non-negativity Conditions**:
     - Since \( \sqrt{3 - x} \) and \( \sqrt{x + 1} \) are square roots, they are non-negative.
     - Therefore, \( 3 - x \geq 0 \) and \( x + 1 \geq 0 \).
  2. **Simplifying the Inequality**:
     - We start by simplifying the inequality \(\sqrt{\sqrt{3-x}-\sqrt{x+1}}>\dfrac{1}{2}\).
     - Squaring both sides, we get:
       \[
       \sqrt{3 - x} - \sqrt{x + 1} > \frac{1}{4}
       \]
     - Rearranging, we have:
       \[
       \sqrt{3 - x} - \sqrt{x + 1} > \frac{1}{4}
       \]
  3. **Bounding \( x \)**:
     - We need to find the bounds for \( x \) that satisfy the inequality.
     - Given the non-negativity and the inequality, we can derive that \( x \) must lie within the interval \([-1, 1 - \frac{\sqrt{127}}{32}]\).
