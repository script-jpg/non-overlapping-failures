  To determine all real numbers \( x \) which satisfy the inequality:
  \[
  \sqrt{\sqrt{3 - x} - \sqrt{x + 1}} > \frac{1}{2},
  \]
  we need to show that \( x \) must lie within the interval \([-1, 1 - \frac{\sqrt{127}}{32}]\).
  Given the conditions:
  1. \( 0 \leq 3 - x \)
  2. \( 0 \leq x + 1 \)
  3. \( \frac{1}{2} < \sqrt{3 - x} - \sqrt{x + 1} \)
  We need to prove that \( -1 \leq x < 1 - \frac{\sqrt{31}}{8} \).
