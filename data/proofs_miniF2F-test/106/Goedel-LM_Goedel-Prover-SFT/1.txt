  To determine all real numbers \( x \) that satisfy the inequality \(\sqrt{\sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1}} > \frac{1}{2}\), we need to show that the solution set is \([-1, 1 - \frac{\sqrt{127}}{32})\). This involves proving two parts:
  1. \( -1 \leq x \)
  2. \( x < 1 - \frac{\sqrt{127}}{32} \)
  Given the conditions \( 0 \leq 3 - x \) and \( 0 \leq x + 1 \), we can infer that \( x \) must be within the interval \([-1, 1 - \frac{\sqrt{127}}{32})\) to satisfy the inequality.

  -- We need to prove two parts: -1 ≤ x and x < 1 - Real.sqrt 31 / 8.

  -- To prove -1 ≤ x, we use the fact that 0 ≤ 3 - x and 0 ≤ x + 1.
  -- Since 0 ≤ 3 - x, we can deduce that x ≥ -1.
