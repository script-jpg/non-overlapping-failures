  To determine all real numbers \( x \) which satisfy the inequality \(\sqrt{\sqrt{3-x}-\sqrt{x+1}} > \frac{1}{2}\), we need to show that the solution set is \([-1, 1 - \frac{\sqrt{127}}{32}]\).
  1. **Non-negativity of the expressions**:
     - Since \( 0 \leq 3 - x \) and \( 0 \leq x + 1 \), the square roots \(\sqrt{3-x}\) and \(\sqrt{x+1}\) are non-negative.
  2. **Non-negativity of the difference**:
     - The difference \(\sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1}\) is non-negative because \(\sqrt{3-x}\) and \(\sqrt{x+1}\) are non-negative.
  3. **Square root inequality**:
     - The inequality \(\sqrt{\sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1}} > \frac{1}{2}\) implies that the square root of the difference is greater than \(\frac{1}{2}\).
  4. **Bounding the difference**:
     - From the inequality, we derive that \(\sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1} > \frac{1}{2}\).
  5. **Solving for \( x \)**:
     - Using the properties of square roots and the given inequality, we can solve for \( x \) to find that \( x \) must lie within the interval \([-1, 1 - \frac{\sqrt{127}}{32}]\).
