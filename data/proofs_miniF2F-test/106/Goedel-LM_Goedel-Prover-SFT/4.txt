  To determine all real numbers \( x \) which satisfy the inequality 
  \[
  \sqrt{\sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1}} > \frac{1}{2},
  \]
  we need to show that it is equivalent to the interval \([-1, 1 - \frac{\sqrt{127}}{32}]\).
  1. **Non-negativity of the terms**: Since \( \sqrt{3-x} \) and \( \sqrt{x+1} \) are square roots of non-negative numbers, they are non-negative.
  2. **Non-negativity of the difference**: The difference \( \sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1} \) is non-negative because the square root of a non-negative number is non-negative and the difference of two non-negative numbers is non-negative.
  3. **Inequality analysis**: The inequality \( \sqrt{\sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1}} > \frac{1}{2} \) implies that the difference \( \sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1} \) must be greater than \( \frac{1}{2} \).
  4. **Solving the inequality**: By solving the inequality \( \sqrt{3-x} - \sqrt{x+1} > \frac{1}{2} \), we find that \( x \) must satisfy \( -1 \leq x < 1 - \frac{\sqrt{31}}{8} \).
