-- Let $f(x) = x^2 - f(x-1).$  Then, we can also write $f(x-1) = (x-1)^2 - f(x-2).$  Substituting this into our equation for $f(x)$, we get  \[f(x) = x^2 - \left( (x-1)^2 - f(x-2) \right) = x^2 - (x-1)^2 + f(x-2).\] Continuing to substitute in this way, we see that the pattern continues: \[f(x) = x^2 - (x-1)^2 + (x-2)^2 - (x-3)^2 + \cdots + (-1)^{18}f(19).\] Since 19 is odd, we have \[f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{18} (-1)^k (x-k)^2 + f(19).\] Then, we can write \[f(94) = \sum_{k=0}^{18} (-1)^k (94-k)^2 + f(19) = \sum_{k=0}^{18} (-1)^k (94^2 - 188k + k^2) + f(19) = 94^2 \sum_{k=0}^{18} (-1)^k - 188 \sum_{k=0}^{18} (-1)^k k + \sum_{k=0}^{18} (-1)^k k^2 + f(19).\] We evaluate each of the three sums using the formulae \begin{align*} \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (-1)^k &= \frac{1 - (-1)^{n-1}}{2}, \\ \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (-1)^k k &= \frac{(-1)^{n-1} (2n-1)}{4}, \\ \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (-1)^k k^2 &= \frac{n(2n-1)(2n-3)}{8} \end{align*} (Proving these formulae is a good way to get used to the techniques of sum manipulations using generating functions or other methods.)  Altogether, we find that $f(94) = 94^2 \cdot 9 + 188 \cdot 47 - \frac{11 \cdot 19 \cdot 37}{2} + 94 = 72472 + 8836 - 41995 + 94 = 35517.$  Therefore, the remainder when $f(94)$ is divided by 1000 is $\boxed{561}.$

  -- We could also have noted that $f(x) = (x+1)^2 - f(x+2).$  Using this, we get  \[f(94) = 95^2 - f(96) = 95^2 - (97^2 - f(99)) = 95^2 - 97^2 + (99^2 - f(101)) = \cdots = \sum_{k=0}^{18} (-1)^k (94+2k)^2 + f(19).\] Expanding this out by hand would be tedious, but using the formulae \begin{align*} \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (2k+1)^2 &= \frac{n(2n+1)(2n-1)}{3}, \\ \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (2k+1) &= n^2 \end{align*} we can evaluate this sum in our heads!  (Again, proving these formulae is a good way to get used to the techniques of sum manipulations using generating functions or other methods.)  Either way, we get that $f(94) = 35517.$  Therefore, the remainder when $f(94)$ is divided by 1000 is $\boxed{561}.$
