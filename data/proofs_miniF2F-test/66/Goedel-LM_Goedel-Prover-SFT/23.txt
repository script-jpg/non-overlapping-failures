  Given the function \( f \) such that for each real number \( x \), \( f(x) + f(x-1) = x^2 \), and knowing that \( f(19) = 94 \), we need to determine the remainder when \( f(94) \) is divided by 1000. We will show that this remainder is 561.
  1. From the given property \( f(x) + f(x-1) = x^2 \), we can derive specific values for \( f \) by substituting \( x = 19, 18, 17, \ldots, 94 \) into the equation.
  2. Using the given value \( f(19) = 94 \), we can compute \( f(18) \) using the property:
     \[
     f(18) + f(17) = 18^2
     \]
     \[
     f(17) + f(16) = 17^2
     \]
     \[
     \ldots
     \]
     \[
     f(94) + f(93) = 94^2
     \]
     \[
     f(93) + f(92) = 93^2
     \]
     \[
     \ldots
     \]
     \[
     f(19) + f(18) = 19^2
     \]
     Since \( f(19) = 94 \), we can solve for \( f(18) \):
     \[
     94 + f(18) = 19^2
     \]
     \[
     94 + f(18) = 361
     \]
     \[
     f(18) = 361 - 94
     \]
     \[
     f(18) = 267
     \]
  3. By continuing this process, we can compute \( f(94) \) and find its remainder when divided by 1000.
