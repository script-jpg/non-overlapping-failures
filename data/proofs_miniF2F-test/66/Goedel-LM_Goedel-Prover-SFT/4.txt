  Given the function \( f \) such that for each real number \( x \), \( f(x) + f(x-1) = x^2 \), and knowing that \( f(19) = 94 \), we need to determine the remainder when \( f(94) \) is divided by 1000. We will show that this remainder is 561.
  1. From the given property \( f(x) + f(x-1) = x^2 \), we can derive specific values for \( f \) at certain points.
  2. Using the property, we can set up equations to solve for \( f(94) \).
  3. By substituting and simplifying, we find that \( f(94) \equiv 561 \pmod{1000} \).
