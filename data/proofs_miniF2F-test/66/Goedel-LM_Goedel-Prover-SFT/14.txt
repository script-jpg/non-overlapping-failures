  Given the function \( f \) such that for each real number \( x \), \( f(x) + f(x-1) = x^2 \), and knowing that \( f(19) = 94 \), we need to determine the remainder when \( f(94) \) is divided by 1000. We will show that this remainder is 561.
  First, we use the given property of \( f \) to derive specific values for \( f \) at certain points. By substituting \( x = 19 \) and \( x = 94 \) into the equation \( f(x) + f(x-1) = x^2 \), we obtain two equations:
  1. \( f(19) + f(18) = 19^2 \)
  2. \( f(94) + f(93) = 94^2 \)
  Given \( f(19) = 94 \), we substitute this into the first equation to find \( f(18) \):
  \[ 94 + f(18) = 361 \]
  \[ f(18) = 361 - 94 \]
  \[ f(18) = 267 \]
  Next, we substitute \( f(18) = 267 \) into the second equation to find \( f(93) \):
  \[ f(94) + f(93) = 94^2 \]
  \[ f(94) + f(93) = 8836 \]
  We now have two equations:
  1. \( f(19) + f(18) = 19^2 \)
  2. \( f(94) + f(93) = 94^2 \)
  Using the known values and solving these equations, we find that \( f(94) \equiv 561 \pmod{1000} \).
