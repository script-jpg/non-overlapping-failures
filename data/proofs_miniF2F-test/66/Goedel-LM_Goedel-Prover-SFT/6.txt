  Given the function \( f \) such that for each real number \( x \),
  \[ f(x) + f(x-1) = x^2, \]
  and knowing that \( f(19) = 94 \), we need to determine the remainder when \( f(94) \) is divided by 1000. We are to show that this remainder is 561.
  First, we use the given property \( f(x) + f(x-1) = x^2 \) to find specific values of \( f \). By evaluating \( f \) at different points, we can derive a pattern or specific values that help in determining \( f(94) \mod 1000 \).
