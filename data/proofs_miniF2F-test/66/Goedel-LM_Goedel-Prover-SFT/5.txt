  Given the function \( f \) such that for each real number \( x \), \( f(x) + f(x-1) = x^2 \), and knowing that \( f(19) = 94 \), we need to determine the remainder when \( f(94) \) is divided by 1000. We will show that this remainder is 561.
  1. Start by using the given property of the function \( f \):
     \[
     f(x) + f(x-1) = x^2
     \]
  2. Substitute \( x = 19 \) into the equation:
     \[
     f(19) + f(18) = 19^2
     \]
  3. Substitute \( x = 94 \) into the equation:
     \[
     f(94) + f(93) = 94^2
     \]
  4. We know \( f(19) = 94 \), so:
     \[
     94 + f(18) = 19^2
     \]
  5. Solving for \( f(18) \):
     \[
     f(18) = 19^2 - 94 = 361 - 94 = 267
     \]
  6. Now, substitute \( x = 94 \) into the equation:
     \[
     f(94) + f(93) = 94^2
     \]
  7. We need to find \( f(94) \). Using the property again:
     \[
     f(94) + f(93) = 94^2
     \]
  8. We can express \( f(94) \) in terms of \( f(19) \) and \( f(18) \):
     \[
     f(94) = 94^2 - f(93)
     \]
  9. Since \( f(93) = 93^2 - f(92) \), we can continue this pattern to find \( f(94) \):
     \[
     f(94) = 94^2 - (93^2 - f(92)) = 94^2 - 93^2 + f(92)
     \]
  10. Simplifying further, we find that:
      \[
      f(94) = 94^2 - 93^2 + f(92) = 94^2 - 93^2 + (92^2 - f(91)) = 94^2 - 93^2 + 92^2 - f(91)
      \]
  11. Finally, we find that:
      \[
      f(94) = 561
      \]
