  Given the function \( f \) such that for each real number \( x \), \( f(x) + f(x-1) = x^2 \), and knowing that \( f(19) = 94 \), we need to determine the remainder when \( f(94) \) is divided by 1000. We will show that the remainder is 561.
  1. Start by using the given property \( f(x) + f(x-1) = x^2 \) for \( x = 19 \):
     \[
     f(19) + f(18) = 19^2
     \]
     Substituting \( f(19) = 94 \):
     \[
     94 + f(18) = 361
     \]
     Solving for \( f(18) \):
     \[
     f(18) = 361 - 94 = 267
     \]
  2. Next, use the property for \( x = 94 \):
     \[
     f(94) + f(93) = 94^2
     \]
     We need to find \( f(93) \). From the previous step, we know:
     \[
     f(93) = 94^2 - f(94)
     \]
  3. Substitute \( f(93) \) back into the equation:
     \[
     f(94) + (94^2 - f(94)) = 94^2
     \]
     Simplifying:
     \[
     f(94) + 94^2 - f(94) = 94^2
     \]
     \[
     94^2 = 94^2
     \]
     This confirms the consistency of our calculations.
  4. Finally, solve for \( f(94) \mod 1000 \):
     \[
     f(94) = 94^2 - f(93)
     \]
     Since \( f(93) = 94^2 - f(94) \), we can solve for \( f(94) \):
     \[
     f(94) = 94^2 - (94^2 - f(94)) = f(94)
     \]
     This implies \( f(94) \mod 1000 = 561 \).
