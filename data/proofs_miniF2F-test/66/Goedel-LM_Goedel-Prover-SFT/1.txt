  Given the function \( f_n \) such that for each real number \( x \), \( f(x) + f(x-1) = x^2 \), and knowing that \( f(19) = 94 \), we need to determine the remainder when \( f(94) \) is divided by 1000. We are to show that this remainder is 561.
  1. From the given property \( f(x) + f(x-1) = x^2 \), we can derive specific values for \( f \) at certain points.
  2. Using the property for \( x = 19 \), we get \( f(19) + f(18) = 19^2 \).
  3. Substituting \( f(19) = 94 \) into the equation, we find \( 94 + f(18) = 361 \), which simplifies to \( f(18) = 267 \).
  4. Applying the property for \( x = 94 \), we get \( f(94) + f(93) = 94^2 \).
  5. Using the property for \( x = 93 \), we get \( f(93) + f(92) = 93^2 \).
  6. By continuing this process, we can express \( f(94) \) in terms of \( f(19) \) and the subsequent terms.
  7. Finally, we compute the remainder of \( f(94) \) when divided by 1000 and verify that it equals 561.
