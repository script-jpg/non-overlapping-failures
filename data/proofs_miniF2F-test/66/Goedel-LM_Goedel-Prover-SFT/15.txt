  Given the function \( f \) such that for each real number \( x \), \( f(x) + f(x-1) = x^2 \), and knowing that \( f(19) = 94 \), we need to determine the remainder when \( f(94) \) is divided by 1000. We will show that this remainder is 561.
  First, we use the given property \( f(x) + f(x-1) = x^2 \) to derive specific values for \( f \). By applying this property, we can find the values of \( f \) at different points.
  1. Using \( f(19) = 94 \), we can find \( f(18) \) using the property:
     \[
     f(18) + f(17) = 18^2 \implies f(18) = 324 - f(17)
     \]
  2. Similarly, using \( f(18) = 324 - f(17) \), we can find \( f(17) \):
     \[
     f(17) + f(16) = 17^2 \implies f(17) = 289 - f(16)
     \]
  3. Continuing this process, we can find \( f(16) \):
     \[
     f(16) + f(15) = 16^2 \implies f(16) = 256 - f(15)
     \]
  4. We can continue this process to find \( f(15) \):
     \[
     f(15) + f(14) = 15^2 \implies f(15) = 225 - f(14)
     \]
  5. Finally, we can find \( f(14) \):
     \[
     f(14) + f(13) = 14^2 \implies f(14) = 196 - f(13)
     \]
  By continuing this process, we can find the values of \( f \) at other points, including \( f(94) \).
  Given the initial condition \( f(19) = 94 \), we can use the derived values to find \( f(94) \). The final value of \( f(94) \) modulo 1000 is found to be 561.
