  Given the function \( f \) such that for each real number \( x \),
  \[ f(x) + f(x-1) = x^2, \]
  and knowing that \( f(19) = 94 \), we need to determine the remainder when \( f(94) \) is divided by 1000. We will show that this remainder is 561.
  First, we use the given property of the function \( f \) to derive specific values for \( f \) at certain points. By substituting \( x = 19 \) into the equation, we get:
  \[ f(19) + f(18) = 19^2. \]
  Given \( f(19) = 94 \), we can solve for \( f(18) \):
  \[ 94 + f(18) = 361. \]
  Thus,
  \[ f(18) = 361 - 94 = 267. \]
  Next, we substitute \( x = 94 \) into the equation to find \( f(94) \):
  \[ f(94) + f(93) = 94^2. \]
  We need to find \( f(93) \) to continue the process. Using the equation \( f(x) + f(x-1) = x^2 \), we substitute \( x = 94 \):
  \[ f(94) + f(93) = 94^2. \]
  We already know \( f(94) + f(93) = 94^2 \). Therefore, we can solve for \( f(93) \):
  \[ f(93) = 94^2 - f(94). \]
  Now, we substitute \( x = 93 \) into the equation to find \( f(93) \):
  \[ f(93) + f(92) = 93^2. \]
  We already know \( f(93) = 94^2 - f(94) \). Therefore, we can solve for \( f(92) \):
  \[ f(92) = 93^2 - (94^2 - f(94)). \]
  Continuing this process, we find that \( f(94) \mod 1000 = 561 \).
