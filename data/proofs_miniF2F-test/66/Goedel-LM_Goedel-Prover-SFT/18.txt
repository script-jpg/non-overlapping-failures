  Given the function \( f(x) \) such that for each real number \( x \), \( f(x) + f(x-1) = x^2 \), and given \( f(19) = 94 \), we need to determine the remainder when \( f(94) \) is divided by 1000. We are to show that this remainder is 561.
  1. Start by applying the given property \( f(x) + f(x-1) = x^2 \) to specific values of \( x \).
  2. Use the property to derive equations for \( f(19) \), \( f(18) \), \( f(17) \), \( f(16) \), \( f(15) \), \( f(14) \), \( f(13) \), \( f(12) \), \( f(11) \), \( f(10) \), \( f(9) \), \( f(8) \), \( f(7) \), \( f(6) \), \( f(5) \), \( f(4) \), \( f(3) \), \( f(2) \), \( f(1) \), and \( f(0) \).
  3. Simplify these equations using the given value \( f(19) = 94 \).
  4. Use the `omega` tactic to solve the resulting system of linear equations and derive the value of \( f(94) \mod 1000 \).
