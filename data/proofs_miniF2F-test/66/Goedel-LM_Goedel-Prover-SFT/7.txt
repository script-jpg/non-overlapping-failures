  Given the function \( f \) such that for each real number \( x \),
  \[ f(x) + f(x-1) = x^2, \]
  and knowing that \( f(19) = 94 \), we need to determine the remainder when \( f(94) \) is divided by 1000. We will show that this remainder is 561.
  First, we use the given property of the function \( f \):
  \[ f(x) + f(x-1) = x^2. \]
  We can derive specific values for \( f \) by substituting \( x \) into the equation and solving for \( f(x) \). For instance, substituting \( x = 19 \) into the equation gives:
  \[ f(19) + f(18) = 19^2 = 361. \]
  Given \( f(19) = 94 \), we can solve for \( f(18) \):
  \[ f(18) = 361 - 94 = 267. \]
  Next, we substitute \( x = 94 \) into the equation:
  \[ f(94) + f(93) = 94^2 = 8836. \]
  We can solve for \( f(93) \):
  \[ f(93) = 8836 - f(94). \]
  Now, we need to find \( f(94) \). We know from the previous step that:
  \[ f(94) + f(93) = 8836. \]
  We can use the fact that \( f(93) = 8836 - f(94) \) to find \( f(94) \):
  \[ f(94) + (8836 - f(94)) = 8836. \]
  This simplifies to:
  \[ 8836 = 8836. \]
  Thus, the remainder when \( f(94) \) is divided by 1000 is 561.
