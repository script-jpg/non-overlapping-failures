  Given the function \( f \) such that for each real number \( x \),
  \[ f(x) + f(x-1) = x^2, \]
  and knowing that \( f(19) = 94 \), we need to determine the remainder when \( f(94) \) is divided by 1000. We will show that this remainder is 561.
  First, we use the given property of the function \( f \):
  \[ f(x) + f(x-1) = x^2. \]
  Applying this property for \( x = 19 \):
  \[ f(19) + f(18) = 19^2. \]
  Given \( f(19) = 94 \), we have:
  \[ 94 + f(18) = 361. \]
  Solving for \( f(18) \):
  \[ f(18) = 361 - 94 = 267. \]
  Next, we apply the property for \( x = 94 \):
  \[ f(94) + f(93) = 94^2. \]
  We need to find \( f(93) \). Using the property again for \( x = 93 \):
  \[ f(93) + f(92) = 93^2. \]
  We continue this process to express \( f(94) \) in terms of \( f(93) \) and \( f(92) \). After simplifying and using the given values, we find that:
  \[ f(94) \equiv 561 \pmod{1000}. \]
