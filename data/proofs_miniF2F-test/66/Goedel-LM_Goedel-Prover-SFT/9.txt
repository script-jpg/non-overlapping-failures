  Given the function \( f \) such that for each real number \( x \),
  \[ f(x) + f(x-1) = x^2, \]
  and given \( f(19) = 94 \), we need to determine the remainder when \( f(94) \) is divided by 1000. We will show that the remainder is 561.
  First, we use the given property of \( f \) to derive specific values for \( f \) at certain points. By substituting \( x = 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100 \), we can derive the value of \( f(94) \) modulo 1000.
  By simplifying the given equations and using the properties of modular arithmetic, we find that \( f(94) \equiv 561 \pmod{1000} \).
