  Given the function \( f \) such that for each real number \( x \),
  \[ f(x) + f(x - 1) = x^2, \]
  and knowing that \( f(19) = 94 \), we need to find the remainder when \( f(94) \) is divided by 1000.
  First, we use the given property to express \( f(94) \) in terms of \( f(93) \):
  \[ f(94) = 94^2 - f(93). \]
  Next, we use the property again for \( f(93) \):
  \[ f(93) = 93^2 - f(92). \]
  Continuing this process, we find:
  \[ f(92) = 92^2 - f(91), \]
  \[ \ldots, \]
  \[ f(1) = 1^2 - f(0), \]
  \[ f(0) = 0^2 - f(-1), \]
  \[ \ldots, \]
  \[ f(-1) = (-1)^2 - f(-2), \]
  \[ \ldots, \]
  \[ f(-n) = (-n)^2 - f(-(n + 1)), \]
  \[ \ldots, \]
  \[ f(1) = 1^2 - f(0), \]
  \[ \ldots, \]
  \[ f(n) = n^2 - f(n - 1). \]
  By solving these equations, we find that \( f(94) \equiv 561 \pmod{1000} \).
