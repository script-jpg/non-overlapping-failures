  Given positive real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(3 \leq ab + bc + ca\), we need to show that:
  \[ \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \leq \frac{a}{\sqrt{a + b}} + \frac{b}{\sqrt{b + c}} + \frac{c}{\sqrt{c + a}}. \]
  To prove this, we start by noting that the square root function is positive for positive inputs. We then use the fact that the square root of a sum of positive numbers is also positive. We apply algebraic manipulation and the use of the non-negativity of squares to establish the inequality.
