  Given positive real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(3 \leq ab + bc + ca\), we need to show that \(3/\sqrt{2} \leq a/\sqrt{a+b} + b/\sqrt{b+c} + c/\sqrt{c+a}\).
  First, we establish that each term in the expression \(a/\sqrt{a+b} + b/\sqrt{b+c} + c/\sqrt{c+a}\) is positive. This is done by showing that the numerator is positive and the denominator is positive.
  Next, we use the fact that the square root function is increasing and positive to manipulate the inequality. We apply the division property of inequalities to show that the sum of the terms is at least \(3/\sqrt{2}\).

  have h₁₀ : 0 < b * c := by nlinarith
  have h₁₁ : 0 < c * a := by nlinarith
