  Given positive real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(3 \leq ab + bc + ca\), we need to show that:
  \[
  \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \leq \frac{a}{\sqrt{a + b}} + \frac{b}{\sqrt{b + c}} + \frac{c}{\sqrt{c + a}}
  \]
  To prove this, we start by noting that since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are positive, we can use the properties of non-negative real numbers and inequalities to establish the desired inequality. Specifically, we will use the fact that the square root function is non-negative and apply algebraic manipulations and inequalities to show the required result.
