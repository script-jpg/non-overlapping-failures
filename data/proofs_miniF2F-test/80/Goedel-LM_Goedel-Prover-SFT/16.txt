  Given positive real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(3 \leq ab + bc + ca\), we need to show that:
  \[
  \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \leq \frac{a}{\sqrt{a+b}} + \frac{b}{\sqrt{b+c}} + \frac{c}{\sqrt{c+a}}
  \]
  To prove this, we start by ensuring that each term in the sum is positive. We then use algebraic manipulation and inequalities to show that the sum of the fractions is at least \(\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}\).
