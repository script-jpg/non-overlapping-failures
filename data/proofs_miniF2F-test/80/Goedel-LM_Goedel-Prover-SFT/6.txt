  Given positive real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(3 \leq ab + bc + ca\), we need to show that:
  \[
  \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \leq \frac{a}{\sqrt{a + b}} + \frac{b}{\sqrt{b + c}} + \frac{c}{\sqrt{c + a}}.
  \]
  To prove this, we start by noting that since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are positive, we can use the properties of real numbers and inequalities. Specifically, we will use the fact that the square root of a positive number is positive and that the sum of non-negative terms is non-negative.
  We will also use the given inequality \(3 \leq ab + bc + ca\) to establish the desired inequality.
