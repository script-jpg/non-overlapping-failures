  Given positive real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(3 \leq ab + bc + ca\), we need to show that \(\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \leq \frac{a}{\sqrt{a+b}} + \frac{b}{\sqrt{b+c}} + \frac{c}{\sqrt{c+a}}\).
  To prove this, we start by noting that since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are positive, the square roots involved are positive. We then use the fact that the square root of a positive number is non-negative, and apply algebraic manipulations to the inequality. Specifically, we use the non-negativity of the square root function and the given conditions to establish the desired inequality.
