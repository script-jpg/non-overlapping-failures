  Given positive real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(3 \leq ab + bc + ca\), we need to show that:
  \[
  \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \leq \frac{a}{\sqrt{a+b}} + \frac{b}{\sqrt{b+c}} + \frac{c}{\sqrt{c+a}}.
  \]
  First, we establish that the terms \(\frac{a}{\sqrt{a+b}}\), \(\frac{b}{\sqrt{b+c}}\), and \(\frac{c}{\sqrt{c+a}}\) are positive. This is done by showing that the numerator is positive and the denominator is positive.
  Next, we use the fact that \(3 \leq ab + bc + ca\) to derive the inequality. We apply the non-negativity of squares and the properties of square roots to manipulate the expressions. Specifically, we use the fact that the square root of a non-negative number is non-negative and that the square of a real number is non-negative.
  Finally, we use algebraic manipulation and the given conditions to conclude the proof.
