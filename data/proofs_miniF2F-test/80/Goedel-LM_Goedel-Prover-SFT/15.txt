theorem algebra_abpbcpcageq3_sumaonsqrtapbgeq3onsqrt2 (a b c : ℝ) (h₀ : 0 < a ∧ 0 < b ∧ 0 < c)
    (h₁ : 3 ≤ a * b + b * c + c * a) :
    3 / Real.sqrt 2 ≤ a / Real.sqrt (a + b) + b / Real.sqrt (b + c) + c / Real.sqrt (c + a) := by

  Given positive real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(3 \leq ab + bc + ca\), we need to show that \(\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \leq \frac{a}{\sqrt{a+b}} + \frac{b}{\sqrt{b+c}} + \frac{c}{\sqrt{c+a}}\).
  To prove this, we start by noting that the square root of 2 is positive, and the square roots of the sums \(a + b\), \(b + c\), and \(c + a\) are also positive. We then simplify the inequality by clearing the denominators using the positivity of these square roots. Finally, we use algebraic manipulation and the given condition \(3 \leq ab + bc + ca\) to establish the inequality.
