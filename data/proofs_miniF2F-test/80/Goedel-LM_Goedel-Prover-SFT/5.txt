  Given positive real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(3 \leq ab + bc + ca\), we need to show that:
  \[
  \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \leq \frac{a}{\sqrt{a+b}} + \frac{b}{\sqrt{b+c}} + \frac{c}{\sqrt{c+a}}.
  \]
  To prove this, we start by ensuring that each term in the sum is positive. We then simplify the expression using algebraic manipulations and apply basic arithmetic inequalities to establish the desired result.
