  Given positive real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(3 \leq ab + bc + ca\), we need to show that:
  \[
  \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \leq \frac{a}{\sqrt{a + b}} + \frac{b}{\sqrt{b + c}} + \frac{c}{\sqrt{c + a}}.
  \]
  To prove this, we start by ensuring that each term in the sum is positive. We then simplify the inequality by clearing denominators and rearranging terms. Finally, we use algebraic manipulations and the given conditions to establish the inequality.
