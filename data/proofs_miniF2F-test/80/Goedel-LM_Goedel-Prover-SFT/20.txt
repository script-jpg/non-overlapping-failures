  Given positive real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(3 \leq ab + bc + ca\), we need to show that:
  \[
  \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \leq \frac{a}{\sqrt{a+b}} + \frac{b}{\sqrt{b+c}} + \frac{c}{\sqrt{c+a}}
  \]
  To prove this, we will use algebraic manipulations and inequalities. First, we simplify the expression by clearing denominators and rearranging terms. We then use the fact that \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are positive and the given inequality \(3 \leq ab + bc + ca\) to establish the desired inequality.
