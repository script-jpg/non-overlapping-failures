theorem algebra_abpbcpcageq3_sumaonsqrtapbgeq3onsqrt2 (a b c : ℝ) (h₀ : 0 < a ∧ 0 < b ∧ 0 < c)
    (h₁ : 3 ≤ a * b + b * c + c * a) :
    3 / Real.sqrt 2 ≤ a / Real.sqrt (a + b) + b / Real.sqrt (b + c) + c / Real.sqrt (c + a) := by

  Given positive real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(3 \leq ab + bc + ca\), we need to show that:
  \[
  \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \leq \frac{a}{\sqrt{a + b}} + \frac{b}{\sqrt{b + c}} + \frac{c}{\sqrt{c + a}}
  \]
  To prove this, we start by noting that the sum of the squares of the differences between the variables is non-negative. Specifically, we use the fact that \((a - b)^2 \geq 0\), \((b - c)^2 \geq 0\), and \((c - a)^2 \geq 0\). These inequalities imply that the sum of the squares of the differences is also non-negative. We then use these inequalities along with the given condition \(3 \leq ab + bc + ca\) to establish the desired inequality.
