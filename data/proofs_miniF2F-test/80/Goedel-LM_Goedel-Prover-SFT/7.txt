  We need to show that for positive real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(3 \leq ab + bc + ca\), it holds that \(\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \leq \frac{a}{\sqrt{a+b}} + \frac{b}{\sqrt{b+c}} + \frac{c}{\sqrt{c+a}}\).
  To prove this, we will use algebraic manipulation and inequalities. First, we normalize the expressions by simplifying them. Then, we apply known inequalities to establish the desired result.
