  We need to show that for positive real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(3 \leq ab + bc + ca\), it follows that \(\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \leq \frac{a}{\sqrt{a + b}} + \frac{b}{\sqrt{b + c}} + \frac{c}{\sqrt{c + a}}\).
  To prove this, we start by noting that the square root of 2 is positive. We then use the fact that the square root function is increasing and that the sum of positive numbers is positive. We apply algebraic manipulations and inequalities to show that the left-hand side is indeed less than or equal to the right-hand side.
