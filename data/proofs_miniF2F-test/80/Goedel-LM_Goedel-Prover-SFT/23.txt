  Given positive real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(3 \leq ab + bc + ca\), we need to show that \(\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \leq \frac{a}{\sqrt{a+b}} + \frac{b}{\sqrt{b+c}} + \frac{c}{\sqrt{c+a}}\).
  To prove this, we will use the fact that the square root of a non-negative number is non-negative and that the product of non-negative numbers is non-negative. We will also use the inequality involving the square root and the fact that the sum of non-negative numbers is non-negative.
