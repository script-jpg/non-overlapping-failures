  Given positive real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(3 \leq ab + bc + ca\), we need to show that \(3 / \sqrt{2} \leq a / \sqrt{a + b} + b / \sqrt{b + c} + c / \sqrt{c + a}\).
  To prove this, we start by noting that since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are positive, the square roots involved are positive. We then simplify the expression using algebraic manipulations and apply basic arithmetic inequalities to establish the desired result.
