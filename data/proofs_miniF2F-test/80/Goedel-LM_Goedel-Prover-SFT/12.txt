  We need to show that for positive real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(3 \leq ab + bc + ca\), it holds that \(3/\sqrt{2} \leq a/\sqrt{a+b} + b/\sqrt{b+c} + c/\sqrt{c+a}\).
  To prove this, we start by noting that since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are positive, the square roots involved are positive. We then use the fact that the square root function is increasing and apply algebraic manipulations to compare the expressions directly.
