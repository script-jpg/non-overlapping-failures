  Given positive real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(3 \leq ab + bc + ca\), we need to show that:
  \[
  \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \leq \frac{a}{\sqrt{a+b}} + \frac{b}{\sqrt{b+c}} + \frac{c}{\sqrt{c+a}}.
  \]
  To prove this, we will use algebraic manipulations and inequalities. First, we normalize the expression by simplifying it. Then, we use the fact that the square root of a positive number is positive to apply basic inequalities. Finally, we use linear arithmetic to conclude the proof.
