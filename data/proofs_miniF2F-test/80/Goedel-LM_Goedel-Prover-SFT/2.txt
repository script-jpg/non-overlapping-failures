  Given positive real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(3 \leq ab + bc + ca\), we need to show that:
  \[ \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \leq \frac{a}{\sqrt{a+b}} + \frac{b}{\sqrt{b+c}} + \frac{c}{\sqrt{c+a}}. \]
  To prove this, we start by ensuring that each term in the sum is positive. We then simplify the inequality using algebraic manipulations and finally apply non-linear arithmetic to verify the inequality.
