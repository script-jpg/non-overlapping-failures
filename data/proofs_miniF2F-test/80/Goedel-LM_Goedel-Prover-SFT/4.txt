  Given positive real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(3 \leq ab + bc + ca\), we need to show that \( \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \leq \frac{a}{\sqrt{a+b}} + \frac{b}{\sqrt{b+c}} + \frac{c}{\sqrt{c+a}} \).
  To prove this, we start by noting that the square root of 2 is positive. We then use the fact that the square root function is increasing and apply algebraic manipulations to the inequality. Specifically, we use the non-negativity of squares and the properties of fractions to derive the desired inequality.
