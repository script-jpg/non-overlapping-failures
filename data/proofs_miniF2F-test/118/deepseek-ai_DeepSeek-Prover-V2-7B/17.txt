  To prove the theorem, we need to find real numbers \( a \) and \( b \) such that \( a \) is irrational, \( b \) is irrational, and \( a^b \) is rational. We will use the fact that the irrationality of \( a \) and \( b \) can be exploited to ensure that \( a^b \) is rational.
  
  1. **Choosing \( a \) and \( b \)**:
     - Let \( a = \sqrt{2} \), which is irrational.
     - Let \( b = 2 \), which is also irrational.
  
  2. **Calculating \( a^b \)**:
     \[
     a^b = \sqrt{2}^2 = 2
     \]
     Since \( 2 \) is rational, this choice satisfies the condition \( a^b \in \mathbb{Q} \).
  
  3. **Verifying \( a \) and \( b \)**:
     - \( a = \sqrt{2} \) is irrational.
     - \( b = 2 \) is irrational.
     - \( a^b = 2 \) is rational.
  
  Thus, the pair \( (\sqrt{2}, 2) \) satisfies all the required conditions.
