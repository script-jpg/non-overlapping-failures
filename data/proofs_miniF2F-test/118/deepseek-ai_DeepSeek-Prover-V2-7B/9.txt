  We need to find real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a\) is irrational, \(b\) is irrational, and \(a^b\) is rational. We will use the fact that the irrationality of \(\sqrt{2}\) and the rationality of \(2\) can be exploited to achieve this.
  
  1. **Choose \(a = \sqrt{2}\).** We know that \(\sqrt{2}\) is irrational.
  2. **Choose \(b = \sqrt{2}\).** We hypothesize that \(\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\) is irrational.
  3. **Verify \(a^b\) is rational.** Compute \((\sqrt{2})^{\sqrt{2}}\):
     - Consider \((\sqrt{2})^{\sqrt{2}}\). This is a positive real number.
     - Assume for contradiction that \((\sqrt{2})^{\sqrt{2}}\) is irrational.
     - Then, raise both sides to the power of \(\sqrt{2}\):
       \[
       ((\sqrt{2})^{\sqrt{2}})^{\sqrt{2}} = (\sqrt{2})^{2} = 2
       \]
     - This would imply that \(2\) is irrational, which is a contradiction.
     - Therefore, our assumption is false, and \((\sqrt{2})^{\sqrt{2}}\) must be rational.
  
  Thus, \(a = \sqrt{2}\), \(b = \sqrt{2}\), \(a\) is irrational, \(b\) is irrational, and \(a^b\) is rational.
