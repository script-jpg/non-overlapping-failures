  We need to find real numbers \( a \) and \( b \) such that \( a \) is irrational, \( b \) is irrational, and \( a^b \) is rational. We will use the fact that the square root of 2 is irrational, and its power properties to achieve this.
  
  1. **Irrational Number \( a \):** Let \( a = \sqrt{2} \).
  2. **Irrational Number \( b \):** Let \( b = \sqrt{2} \).
  3. **Rationality of \( a^b \):** We need to find \( a^b = (\sqrt{2})^{\sqrt{2}}\).
     - Consider the property of \( (\sqrt{2})^{\sqrt{2}} \):
       - If \( (\sqrt{2})^{\sqrt{2}} \) is rational, we are done.
       - If \( (\sqrt{2})^{\sqrt{2}} \) is irrational, we need to find another \( b \) such that \( (\sqrt{2})^b \) is rational.
     - By the Gelfond-Schneider Theorem, for irrational \( a \) and irrational \( b \), \( a^b \) can be either rational or irrational.
     - In this case, \( (\sqrt{2})^{\sqrt{2}} \) is irrational.
     - Therefore, we need to find another \( b \) such that \( (\sqrt{2})^b \) is rational.
     - Let \( b = 2 \):
       - \( (\sqrt{2})^2 = 2 \), which is rational.
       - Thus, \( a = \sqrt{2} \), \( b = 2 \), and \( a^b = 2 \) satisfy the conditions.
  
  Therefore, the pair \( (\sqrt{2}, 2) \) satisfies the conditions of the theorem.
