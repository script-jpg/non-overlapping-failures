  We need to find real numbers \( a \) and \( b \) such that \( a \) is irrational, \( b \) is irrational, and \( a^b \) is rational. We will use the fact that the irrationality of \( a \) and \( b \) can be exploited to ensure that \( a^b \) is rational. Specifically, we will consider the case where \( a \) is irrational, \( b \) is irrational, and \( a^b = 2 \), which is rational.

  Consider \( a = \sqrt{2} \) and \( b = 2 \). Here, \( a \) is irrational (since \( \sqrt{2} \) is irrational), and \( b \) is rational. We need to ensure that \( a^b \) is rational. However, \( a^b = (\sqrt{2})^2 = 2 \), which is rational. Thus, \( a^b \) is rational, satisfying our requirement.
