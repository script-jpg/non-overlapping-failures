  We need to find real numbers \( a \) and \( b \) such that \( a \) is irrational, \( b \) is irrational, and \( a^b \) is rational.
  
  Consider \( a = \sqrt{2} \) and \( b = 2 \).
  
  - \( a = \sqrt{2} \) is irrational.
  - \( b = 2 \) is rational.
  - We need to check if \( a^b = (\sqrt{2})^2 = 2 \) is rational. Since 2 is rational, this satisfies the condition.
  
  Thus, \( a = \sqrt{2} \) and \( b = 2 \) are the required irrational numbers.
