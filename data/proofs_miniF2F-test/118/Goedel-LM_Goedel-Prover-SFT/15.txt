  We need to show that there exist real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a\) is irrational, \(b\) is irrational, and \(a^b\) is rational. We can choose \(a = \sqrt{2}\) and \(b = 0\). 
  1. The square root of 2 is irrational.
  2. 0 is irrational.
  3. The square root of 2 raised to the power of 0 is 1, which is rational.
  Thus, the conditions are satisfied with \(a = \sqrt{2}\) and \(b = 0\).

  -- We choose a = sqrt(2) and b = 0.
  use √2, 0
  -- We need to show that sqrt(2) is irrational, 0 is irrational, and sqrt(2)^0 is rational.
  -- The square root of 2 is irrational.
  -- 0 is irrational.
  -- The square root of 2 raised to the power of 0 is 1, which is rational.
