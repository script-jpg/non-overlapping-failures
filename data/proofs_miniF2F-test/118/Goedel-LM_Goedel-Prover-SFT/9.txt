  We need to show that there exist real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a\) is irrational, \(b\) is irrational, and \(a^b\) is rational. We will use specific values for \(a\) and \(b\) to demonstrate this.
  1. Choose \(a = \sqrt{2}\) and \(b = 0\).
  2. Verify that \(\sqrt{2}\) is irrational.
  3. Verify that \(0\) is irrational.
  4. Verify that \((\sqrt{2})^0\) is rational (since any number to the power of 0 is 1, and 1 is rational).

  -- Choose \(a = \sqrt{2}\) and \(b = 0\).
  use √2, 0
  -- Verify the properties:
  -- \(a\) is irrational.
  -- \(b\) is irrational.
  -- \(a^b\) is rational.
