  We need to find real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a\) is irrational, \(b\) is irrational, and \(a^b\) is rational. We propose \(a = \sqrt{2}\) and \(b = \log(\sqrt{2})\).
  1. **Irrationality of \(a\)**: We know that \(\sqrt{2}\) is irrational.
  2. **Irrationality of \(b\)**: We need to show that \(\log(\sqrt{2})\) is irrational. By properties of logarithms, \(\log(\sqrt{2})\) is irrational because \(\sqrt{2}\) is not a power of 2.
  3. **Rationality of \(a^b\)**: We need to show that \((\sqrt{2})^{\log(\sqrt{2})}\) is rational. Using the change of base formula for logarithms, we have:
     \[
     (\sqrt{2})^{\log(\sqrt{2})} = 2^{\frac{\log(\sqrt{2})}{\log 2}}
     \]
     Since \(\log 2\) is a rational number, and \(\log(\sqrt{2})\) is also rational, the exponent \(\frac{\log(\sqrt{2})}{\log 2}\) is rational. Therefore, \(2^{\frac{\log(\sqrt{2})}{\log 2}}\) is rational.
  Thus, we have found \(a = \sqrt{2}\) and \(b = \log(\sqrt{2})\) that satisfy the conditions.
