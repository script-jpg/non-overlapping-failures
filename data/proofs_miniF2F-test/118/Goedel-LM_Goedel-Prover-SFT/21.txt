  We need to show that there exist real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a\) is irrational, \(b\) is irrational, and \(a^b\) is rational. We will use specific values for \(a\) and \(b\) to demonstrate this.
  1. Choose \(a = \sqrt{2}\) and \(b = 0\).
  2. Verify that \(\sqrt{2}\) is irrational.
  3. Verify that \(0\) is irrational.
  4. Check that \((\sqrt{2})^0 = 1\) is rational.
