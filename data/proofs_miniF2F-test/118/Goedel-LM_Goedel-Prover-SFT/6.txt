  We need to show that there exist real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a\) is irrational, \(b\) is irrational, and \(a^b\) is rational. We will use specific values for \(a\) and \(b\) to demonstrate this.
  1. Choose \(a = \sqrt{2}\) and \(b = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\).
  2. Verify that \(\sqrt{2}\) is irrational.
  3. Verify that \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\) is irrational.
  4. Show that \((\sqrt{2})^{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}}\) is rational.
