  We need to find real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a\) is irrational, \(b\) is irrational, and \(a^b\) is rational. We propose \(a = \sqrt{2}\) and \(b = 0\). 
  1. The square root of 2 is irrational.
  2. 0 is irrational.
  3. \((\sqrt{2})^0 = 1\), which is rational.
  Thus, the conditions are satisfied with \(a = \sqrt{2}\) and \(b = 0\).
