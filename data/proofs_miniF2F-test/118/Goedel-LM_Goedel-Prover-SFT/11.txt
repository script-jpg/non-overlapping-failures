  We need to show that there exist real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a\) is irrational, \(b\) is irrational, and \(a^b\) is rational. We will use \(a = \sqrt{2}\) and \(b = 0\) as examples. 
  1. \(\sqrt{2}\) is irrational.
  2. \(0\) is irrational.
  3. \((\sqrt{2})^0 = 1\), which is rational.
  Thus, we have found the required real numbers.

  -- We choose \(a = \sqrt{2}\) and \(b = 0\).
  use √2, 0
  -- We verify the conditions:
  -- 1. \(\sqrt{2}\) is irrational.
  -- 2. \(0\) is irrational.
  -- 3. \((\sqrt{2})^0 = 1\), which is rational.
