  We need to show that there exist real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a\) is irrational, \(b\) is irrational, and \(a^b\) is rational. We will use the numbers \(a = \sqrt{2}\) and \(b = 0\) to demonstrate this.
  1. **Irrationality of \(\sqrt{2}\)**: It is a well-known result that \(\sqrt{2}\) is irrational.
  2. **Irrationality of \(0\)**: Clearly, \(0\) is irrational.
  3. **Non-Irrationality of \((\sqrt{2})^0\)**: Since any number raised to the power of \(0\) is \(1\), and \(1\) is not irrational, we have \((\sqrt{2})^0 = 1\).
  Thus, we have found \(a = \sqrt{2}\) and \(b = 0\) that satisfy the conditions.
