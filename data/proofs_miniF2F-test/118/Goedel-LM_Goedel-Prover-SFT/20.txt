  We need to show that there exist real numbers \( a \) and \( b \) such that \( a \) is irrational, \( b \) is irrational, and \( a^b \) is rational. We will use \( a = \sqrt{2} \) and \( b = 0 \) as examples.
  1. **Irrationality of \( \sqrt{2} \)**: It is a well-known fact that \( \sqrt{2} \) is irrational.
  2. **Irrationality of \( 0 \)**: The number \( 0 \) is trivially irrational.
  3. **Rationality of \( (\sqrt{2})^0 \)**: Any number raised to the power of 0 is 1. Since 1 is rational, \( (\sqrt{2})^0 \) is rational.
  Thus, we have found \( a = \sqrt{2} \) and \( b = 0 \) that satisfy the conditions.
