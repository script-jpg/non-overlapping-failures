  We need to show that there exist real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a\) is irrational, \(b\) is irrational, and \(a^b\) is rational. We will use \(a = \sqrt{2}\) and \(b = \log_{\sqrt{2}} 2\) as examples.
  1. **Irrationality of \(a\)**: We know that \(\sqrt{2}\) is irrational.
  2. **Irrationality of \(b\)**: We need to show that \(\log_{\sqrt{2}} 2\) is irrational. This can be derived from the fact that the logarithm of a prime number to a base greater than 1 is irrational.
  3. **Rationality of \(a^b\)**: We need to show that \((\sqrt{2})^{\log_{\sqrt{2}} 2}\) is rational. This can be derived from the properties of logarithms and the fact that \(\sqrt{2}\) raised to a rational power is rational.
