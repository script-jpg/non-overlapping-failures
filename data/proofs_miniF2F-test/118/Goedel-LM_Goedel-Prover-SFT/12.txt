  We need to find real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a\) is irrational, \(b\) is irrational, and \(a^b\) is rational. We choose \(a = \sqrt{2}\) and \(b = 0\). 
  1. **Irrationality of \(\sqrt{2}\)**: It is a well-known result that \(\sqrt{2}\) is irrational.
  2. **Irrationality of \(0\)**: The number \(0\) is irrational.
  3. **Rationality of \((\sqrt{2})^0\)**: Any number raised to the power of \(0\) is \(1\), and \(1\) is rational.
  Thus, we have found \(a = \sqrt{2}\) and \(b = 0\) that satisfy the conditions.
