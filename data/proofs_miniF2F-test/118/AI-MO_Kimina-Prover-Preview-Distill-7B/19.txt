/- The standard solution is to use $a = \sqrt{2}$ and $b = 2$. $a$ and $b$ are irrational, but $a^b = (\sqrt{2})^2 = 2$ is rational.
     So we can use `irrational_sqrt_two` and `irrational_iff` to prove this theorem.-/
  use √2, 2

  /- In order to use `irrational_sqrt_two`, we need to convert `a` to `√2`.-/
  have ha : a = √2 := by
    simp only [←irrational_sqrt_two, a]
  have hb : b = 2 := by simp only [b]

  constructor
  · -- `a` is irrational
