  We aim to prove that the number \(\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{2n+1}{2k+1} 2^{3k}\) is not divisible by 5 for any integer \(n \geq 0\). The proof involves showing that the sum modulo 5 is never zero. This is achieved by demonstrating that the sum modulo 5 is congruent to 1 or 2, which are not divisible by 5.
