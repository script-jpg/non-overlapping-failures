  We aim to prove that the number \(\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{2n+1}{2k+1} \cdot 2^{3k}\) is not divisible by 5 for any integer \(n \geq 0\).
  1. **Base Case (n = 0):**
     - The sum simplifies to \(\binom{1}{1} \cdot 2^0 = 1\), which is not divisible by 5.
  2. **Inductive Step:**
     - Assume the statement holds for \(n\). We need to show it holds for \(n + 1\).
     - The sum for \(n + 1\) can be written as \(\sum_{k=0}^{n+1} \binom{2(n+1)+1}{2k+1} \cdot 2^{3k}\).
     - This can be split into \(\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{2n+1}{2k+1} \cdot 2^{3k} + \binom{2(n+1)+1}{2(n+1)+1} \cdot 2^{3(n+1)}\).
     - By the inductive hypothesis, the first part is not divisible by 5.
     - The second part, \(\binom{2(n+1)+1}{2(n+1)+1} \cdot 2^{3(n+1)}\), is a multiple of 5, and thus the entire sum is not divisible by 5.
