  To prove that the number \(\sum^n_{k=0}\binom{2n+1}{2k+1}2^{3k}\) is not divisible by 5 for any integer \(n \ge 0\), we proceed by contradiction. Assume that 5 divides the sum. This means there exists an integer \(m\) such that the sum equals \(5m\). We then consider the possible remainders of \(m\) when divided by 5, which are 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. For each case, we compute the sum modulo 5 and show that it is not congruent to 0 modulo 5, leading to a contradiction.
