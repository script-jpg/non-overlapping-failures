  To prove that the number \(\sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{2n+1}{2k+1}2^{3k}\) is not divisible by 5 for any integer \(n \geq 0\), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Rewrite the sum**: The sum \(\sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{2n+1}{2k+1}2^{3k}\) can be rewritten using the binomial theorem.
  2. **Simplify the expression**: By expanding and simplifying the expression, we can show that it is not divisible by 5.
  3. **Use properties of binomial coefficients**: The binomial coefficient \(\binom{2n+1}{2k+1}\) is an integer, and we need to show that the sum of these coefficients multiplied by \(2^{3k}\) is not divisible by 5.
  4. **Check divisibility by 5**: We need to check if the sum is divisible by 5, and if so, we need to find the condition under which it is divisible by 5.
  5. **Use modular arithmetic**: We can use modular arithmetic to show that the sum is not divisible by 5.
