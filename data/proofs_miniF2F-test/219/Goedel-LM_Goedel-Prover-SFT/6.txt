  To prove that the number \(\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{2n+1}{2k+1} 2^{3k}\) is not divisible by 5 for any integer \(n \geq 0\), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Simplify the Sum**: The sum \(\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{2n+1}{2k+1} 2^{3k}\) is a specific sum of binomial coefficients and powers of 2.
  2. **Modulo 5 Analysis**: We analyze the sum modulo 5. The binomial coefficient \(\binom{2n+1}{2k+1}\) is always an integer, and we need to determine its divisibility by 5.
  3. **Divisibility Condition**: We need to show that the sum is not divisible by 5. This can be done by examining the properties of binomial coefficients and their residues modulo 5.
