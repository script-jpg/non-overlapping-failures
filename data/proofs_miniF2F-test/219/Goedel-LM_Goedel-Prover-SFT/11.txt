  We need to prove that the number \(\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{2n+1}{2k+1}2^{3k}\) is not divisible by 5 for any integer \(n \geq 0\). The proof proceeds by contradiction. Assume that the sum is divisible by 5. We will show that this leads to a contradiction.
  1. **Base Case Analysis**: For \(n = 0\), the sum simplifies to \(\binom{1}{1} \cdot 2^0 = 1\), which is not divisible by 5.
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds for some \(n\). We need to show it holds for \(n + 1\).
  3. **Simplification and Modulo 5**: Using properties of binomial coefficients and modular arithmetic, we simplify the sum modulo 5 and show that it cannot be congruent to 0 modulo 5.
