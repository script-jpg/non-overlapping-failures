  To prove that the number \(\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{2n+1}{2k+1}2^{3k}\) is not divisible by 5 for any integer \(n \geq 0\), we proceed by induction on \(n\).
  **Base Case: \(n = 0\)**
  For \(n = 0\), the sum is:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^0 \binom{2 \cdot 0 + 1}{2k + 1} \cdot 2^{3k} = \binom{1}{1} \cdot 2^0 = 1
  \]
  Clearly, 1 is not divisible by 5.
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for \(n\), i.e., \(\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{2n+1}{2k+1}2^{3k}\) is not divisible by 5. We need to show it holds for \(n + 1\).
  Consider the sum for \(n + 1\):
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{n+1} \binom{2(n+1)+1}{2k+1}2^{3k} = \sum_{k=0}^n \binom{2n+3}{2k+1}2^{3k} + \binom{2(n+1)+1}{2(n+1)+1}2^{3(n+1)}
  \]
  By the inductive hypothesis, \(\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{2n+1}{2k+1}2^{3k}\) is not divisible by 5. We need to show that the additional term \(\binom{2(n+1)+1}{2(n+1)+1}2^{3(n+1)}\) is also not divisible by 5.
  Since \(\binom{2(n+1)+1}{2(n+1)+1} = \binom{2n+3}{2n+3}\), we have:
  \[
  \binom{2n+3}{2n+3}2^{3(n+1)} = 2^{3n+3}
  \]
  Clearly, \(2^{3n+3}\) is not divisible by 5 because the powers of 2 modulo 5 cycle every 4 steps, and \(3n+3\) is not a multiple of 4 for any \(n\).
  Thus, by induction, \(\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{2n+1}{2k+1}2^{3k}\) is not divisible by 5 for any \(n \geq 0\).
