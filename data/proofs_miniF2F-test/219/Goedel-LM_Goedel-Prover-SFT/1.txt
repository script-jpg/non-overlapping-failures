  To prove that the number \(\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{2n+1}{2k+1}2^{3k}\) is not divisible by 5 for any integer \(n \ge 0\), we proceed by contradiction. Assume that the number is divisible by 5. We will show that this leads to a contradiction.
  1. **Simplify the expression**: Consider the sum \(\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{2n+1}{2k+1}2^{3k}\).
  2. **Analyze the modulo 5 properties**: We will examine the sum modulo 5 to find a contradiction.
  3. **Use properties of binomial coefficients**: Specifically, we use the fact that \(\binom{2n+1}{2k+1}\) is a binomial coefficient and analyze its properties modulo 5.
  4. **Conclude by contradiction**: By examining the sum modulo 5, we will show that it cannot be divisible by 5.
