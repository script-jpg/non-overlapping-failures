  We aim to prove that the number \(\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{2n+1}{2k+1} 2^{3k}\) is not divisible by 5 for any integer \(n \geq 0\). We will use modular arithmetic to show that the sum is not congruent to 0 modulo 5.
  1. **Sum Representation**: The sum \(\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{2n+1}{2k+1} 2^{3k}\) represents a specific sequence of binomial coefficients multiplied by powers of 2.
  2. **Modular Arithmetic**: We will analyze the sum modulo 5. By properties of binomial coefficients and modular arithmetic, we can simplify the expression.
  3. **Non-Divisibility by 5**: We will show that the sum is not congruent to 0 modulo 5, thus proving that it is not divisible by 5.
