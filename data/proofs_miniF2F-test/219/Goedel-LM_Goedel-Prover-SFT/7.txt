  To prove that the number \(\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{2n+1}{2k+1}2^{3k}\) is not divisible by 5 for any integer \(n \ge 0\), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Simplify the Sum**: We start by simplifying the sum \(\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{2n+1}{2k+1}2^{3k}\).
  2. **Use Properties of Binomial Coefficients**: We use properties of binomial coefficients and modular arithmetic to analyze the sum modulo 5.
  3. **Contradiction Argument**: We show that the sum cannot be divisible by 5 by examining the properties of the binomial coefficients and their contributions to the sum modulo 5.
