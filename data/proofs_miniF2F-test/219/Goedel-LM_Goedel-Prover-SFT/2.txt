  To prove that the number \(\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{2n+1}{2k+1}2^{3k}\) is not divisible by 5 for any integer \(n \ge 0\), we will use modular arithmetic to show that the sum modulo 5 is never zero.
  1. **Base Case**: When \(n = 0\), the sum is \(\binom{1}{1} \cdot 2^0 = 1\), which is not divisible by 5.
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume that for some \(n\), the sum \(\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{2n+1}{2k+1}2^{3k}\) is not divisible by 5. We need to show that the sum for \(n+1\) is also not divisible by 5.
     By the properties of binomial coefficients and modular arithmetic, we can show that the sum modulo 5 remains non-zero for \(n+1\).
