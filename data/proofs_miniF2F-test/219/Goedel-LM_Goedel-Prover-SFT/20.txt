  To prove that the number \(\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{2n+1}{2k+1}2^{3k}\) is not divisible by 5 for any integer \(n \ge 0\), we proceed by contradiction. Assume that the sum is divisible by 5. We then consider the possible remainders of \(n\) when divided by 5, which are 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. For each case, we compute the sum modulo 5 and show that it is not congruent to 0 modulo 5, leading to a contradiction.
