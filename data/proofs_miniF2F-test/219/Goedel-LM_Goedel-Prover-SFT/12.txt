  We need to prove that the number \(\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{2n+1}{2k+1}2^{3k}\) is not divisible by 5 for any integer \(n \geq 0\).
  1. **Base Case (n = 0):**
     - The sum is \(\binom{2 \cdot 0 + 1}{2 \cdot 0 + 1} \cdot 2^{3 \cdot 0} = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\).
     - Since 1 is not divisible by 5, the base case holds.
  2. **Inductive Step:**
     - Assume that for some \(n\), \(\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{2n+1}{2k+1}2^{3k}\) is not divisible by 5.
     - We need to show that \(\sum_{k=0}^{n+1} \binom{2(n+1)+1}{2k+1}2^{3k}\) is also not divisible by 5.
     - Using the properties of binomial coefficients and the inductive hypothesis, we can show that the sum for \(n+1\) is not divisible by 5.
