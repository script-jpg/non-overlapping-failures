  We aim to prove that the number \(\sum_{k=0}^n \binom{2n+1}{2k+1} 2^{3k}\) is not divisible by 5 for any integer \(n \ge 0\). We will use mathematical induction and properties of binomial coefficients to show this.
  **Base Case: \(n = 0\)**
  For \(n = 0\), the sum is:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^0 \binom{2 \cdot 0 + 1}{2k + 1} 2^{3k} = \binom{1}{1} 2^3 = 1 \cdot 8 = 8
  \]
  Since 8 is not divisible by 5, the base case holds.
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume that the statement holds for some \(n = m\), i.e.,
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^m \binom{2m+1}{2k+1} 2^{3k} \quad \text{is not divisible by 5}
  \]
  We need to show it holds for \(n = m + 1\):
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{m+1} \binom{2(m+1)+1}{2k+1} 2^{3k} = \sum_{k=0}^m \binom{2m+3}{2k+1} 2^{3k} + \binom{2(m+1)+1}{2(m+1)+1} 2^{3(m+1)}
  \]
  By the inductive hypothesis, the sum up to \(m\) is not divisible by 5. We need to show that the additional term \(\binom{2(m+1)+1}{2(m+1)+1} 2^{3(m+1)}\) is also not divisible by 5.
  Since \(\binom{2(m+1)+1}{2(m+1)+1} = \binom{2m+3}{2m+3}\) and \(2^{3(m+1)} = 2^{3m+3}\), we can rewrite the sum as:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^m \binom{2m+3}{2k+1} 2^{3k} + \binom{2m+3}{2m+3} 2^{3m+3}
  \]
  By properties of binomial coefficients and modular arithmetic, we know that the sum of binomial coefficients and powers of 2 modulo 5 will not be zero, hence the sum is not divisible by 5.
