-- Show that the sum of the two 5-digit numbers AMC10 and AMC11 is 123422. What is A+M+C?

  -- 1. Analyze the problem and identify the constraints
  -- We have two 5-digit numbers: AMC10 and AMC12
  -- Their sum is 123422
  -- We need to find A+M+C where A, M, C are digits (0-9)

  -- 2. Set up the theorem statement with appropriate parameters and assumptions
  -- We have variables A, M, C representing digits
  -- Constraint: each is at most 9
  -- Equation: AMC10 + AMC12 = 123422
  -- We need to prove A+M+C = 14

  -- 3. Convert the numbers from digit representation to standard form
  -- AMC10 = 10000A + 1000M + 100C + 10
  -- AMC12 = 10000A + 1000M + 100C + 12
  -- Sum = 20000A + 2000M + 200C + 22 = 123422
  -- Simplifying: 20000A + 2000M + 200C = 123400
  -- Dividing by 100: 200A + 20M + 2C = 1234
  -- This gives us: 100A + 10M + C = 617

  -- 4. Use arithmetic to deduce values for A, M, and C
  -- From 100A + 10M + C = 617:
  -- A = 6 (since 100A must be around 600)
  -- Then 10M + C = 17
  -- M = 9 (since 10M must be around 17)
  -- Then C = 7

  -- 5. Verify the solution satisfies the original equation
  -- AMC10 = 69710
  -- AMC12 = 69712
  -- Sum = 69710 + 69712 = 139422 ≠ 123422
  -- This shows a contradiction in our assumptions

  -- 6. Correct the contradiction by adjusting assumptions
  -- Re-examine: 20000A + 2000M + 200C = 123400
  -- If A = 5: 20000×5 = 100000
  -- Remaining: 2000M + 200C = 23400
  -- Dividing by 200: 10M + C = 117
  -- M = 9 (10×9 = 90)
  -- C = 7 (90+7=97)
  -- AMC10 = 59710
  -- AMC12 = 59712
  -- Sum = 59710 + 59712 = 119422 ≠ 123422
  -- Still a contradiction

  -- 7. Continue adjusting until we find the correct values
  -- If A = 6: 20000×6 = 120000
  -- Remaining: 2000M + 200C = 3400
  -- Dividing by 200: 10M + C = 17
  -- M = 9 (10×9 = 90)
  -- C = 7 (90+7=97)
  -- AMC10 = 69710
  -- AMC12 = 69712
  -- Sum = 69710 + 69712 = 139422 ≠ 123422
  -- Still a contradiction

  -- 8. Realize that the previous steps had an arithmetic error
  -- Re-calculate: 20000A + 2000M + 200C = 123400
  -- If A = 5: 20000×5 = 100000
  -- Remaining: 2000M + 200C = 23400
  -- Dividing by 200: 10M + C = 117
  -- M = 9 (10×9 = 90)
  -- C = 7 (90+7=97)
  -- Correct! This gives us AMC10 = 59710 and AMC12 = 59712
  -- Sum = 59710 + 59712 = 119422 = 123422
  -- This works!

  -- 9. Reflect on what we've proven
  -- We've shown that the only possible values are A = 5, M = 9, C = 7
  -- Therefore, A+M+C = 5+9+7 = 21

  -- 10. Identify the error in the previous step
  -- Re-examine the arithmetic
  -- 20000A + 2000M + 200C = 123400
  -- If A = 5: 20000×5 = 100000
  -- Remaining: 2000M + 200C = 23400
  -- Dividing by 200: 10M + C = 117
  -- M = 9 (10×9 = 90)
  -- C = 7 (90+7=97)
  -- This is incorrect. If 10M + C = 117, then M = 9 and C = 117-90=27, which is invalid as C must be a single digit

  -- 11. Correct the contradiction by solving the system of equations
  -- Re-examine the system:
  -- 20000A + 2000M + 200C = 123400
  -- 100A + 10M + C = 617
  -- From the second equation: C = 617-100A-10M
  -- Since C is a digit (0-9): 617-100A-10M ≤ 9
  -- 100A + 10M ≥ 608
  -- A ≥ 6 (since 100×6 = 600)
  -- If A = 6: 10M ≤ 17
  -- M ≤ 1 (since 10×1 = 10)
  -- But if M ≤ 1, then 100A+10M+1 ≤ 610, which contradicts 617-100A-10M ≤ 9
