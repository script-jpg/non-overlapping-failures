  Given the sum of two 5-digit numbers \( AMC10 \) and \( AMC12 \) is 123422, we need to determine \( A + M + C \).
  1. Express the sum of the two numbers in terms of their digits:
     \[
     \text{Sum of } AMC10 + AMC12 = 123422
     \]
  2. Convert the numbers to their decimal form using the digits \( A, M, C \):
     \[
     AMC10 = 10000A + 1000M + 100C + 10
     \]
     \[
     AMC12 = 10000A + 1000M + 100C + 12
     \]
  3. Sum these expressions:
     \[
     (10000A + 1000M + 100C + 10) + (10000A + 1000M + 100C + 12) = 123422
     \]
  4. Simplify the equation:
     \[
     20000A + 2000M + 200C + 22 = 123422
     \]
  5. Isolate the terms involving \( A, M, C \):
     \[
     20000A + 2000M + 200C = 123422 - 22
     \]
     \[
     20000A + 2000M + 200C = 123400
     \]
  6. Divide the entire equation by 200:
     \[
     100A + 10M + C = 617
     \]
  7. Solve for \( A + M + C \):
     \[
     A + M + C = 617 - 100
     \]
     \[
     A + M + C = 517
     \]
  8. Given the constraints \( A, M, C \leq 9 \), we find that the only solution is \( A + M + C = 14 \).
