  Given the sum of the two 5-digit numbers \( AMC10 \) and \( AMC12 \) is 123422, we need to find the value of \( A + M + C \).
  1. Start by expressing the sum of \( AMC10 \) and \( AMC12 \) in terms of their digits.
  2. Use the given sum to set up an equation involving the digits \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \).
  3. Simplify the equation to isolate the sum of \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \).
  4. Use the constraints on the digits to solve for the sum \( A + M + C \).
