  Given the two 5-digit numbers \( AMC10 \) and \( AMC12 \), we know their sum is \( 123422 \). We need to determine \( A + M + C \).
  First, we express the given numbers in terms of their digits:
  - \( AMC10 = 10000A + 1000M + 100C + 10 \)
  - \( AMC12 = 10000A + 1000M + 100C + 12 \)
  The sum of these two numbers is:
  \[ (10000A + 1000M + 100C + 10) + (10000A + 1000M + 100C + 12) = 123422 \]
  Simplifying the left-hand side:
  \[ 20000A + 2000M + 200C + 22 = 123422 \]
  Subtracting 22 from both sides:
  \[ 20000A + 2000M + 200C = 123400 \]
  Dividing the entire equation by 200:
  \[ 100A + 10M + C = 617 \]
  Since \( A, M, C \) are digits (0-9), we solve for \( A, M, C \) using the constraints and the equation. By testing possible values, we find that \( A = 6 \), \( M = 1 \), and \( C = 7 \) satisfy the equation:
  \[ 100 \cdot 6 + 10 \cdot 1 + 7 = 617 \]
  Thus, \( A + M + C = 6 + 1 + 7 = 14 \).
