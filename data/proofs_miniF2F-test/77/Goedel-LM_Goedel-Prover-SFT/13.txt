  Given the sum of the two 5-digit numbers \( AMC10 \) and \( AMC12 \) is \( 123422 \), we need to find \( A + M + C \).
  First, we express the sum of the two numbers in terms of \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \):
  \[ 10000A + 1000M + 100C + 10A + 20000A + 2000M + 200C + 20A = 123422 \]
  Simplifying the left-hand side:
  \[ 10000A + 1000M + 100C + 10A + 20000A + 2000M + 200C + 20A = 30000A + 3000M + 300C + 30A \]
  Thus, the equation becomes:
  \[ 30000A + 3000M + 300C + 30A = 123422 \]
  Dividing both sides by 30:
  \[ 1000A + 100M + 10C + A = 4114.0667 \]
  Since \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \) are integers, the left-hand side must also be an integer. Therefore, the only possible values for \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \) that satisfy the equation are \( A = 4 \), \( M = 1 \), and \( C = 0 \).
  Finally, we calculate \( A + M + C \):
  \[ A + M + C = 4 + 1 + 0 = 5 \]
