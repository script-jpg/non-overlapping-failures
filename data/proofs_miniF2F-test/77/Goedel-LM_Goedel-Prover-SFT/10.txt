  Given the sum of the two 5-digit numbers \(AMC10\) and \(AMC12\) is \(123422\), we need to determine the value of \(A + M + C\).
  1. Convert the given sum equation into a form that can be simplified.
  2. Use the properties of addition and the constraints on \(A\), \(M\), and \(C\) to derive the final result.
