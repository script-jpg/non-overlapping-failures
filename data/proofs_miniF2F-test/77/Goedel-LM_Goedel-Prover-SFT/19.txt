  Given the sum of the two 5-digit numbers \(AMC10\) and \(AMC12\) is \(123422\), we need to determine \(A + M + C\).
  First, we express the given sum in terms of the digits \(A\), \(M\), and \(C\):
  \[ 10000A + 1000M + 100C + 10A + M + 10000A + 1000M + 100C + 10A + 2M = 123422 \]
  Simplifying this equation, we get:
  \[ 20000A + 2000M + 200C + 20A + 2M = 123422 \]
  \[ 20220A + 2002M + 200C = 123422 \]
  Next, we use the fact that \(A\), \(M\), and \(C\) are digits (i.e., \(0 \leq A, M, C \leq 9\)) and solve for \(A + M + C\). By using the `omega` tactic, which is a decision procedure for linear integer arithmetic, we find that:
  \[ A + M + C = 14 \]
