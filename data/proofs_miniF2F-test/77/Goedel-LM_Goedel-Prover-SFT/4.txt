  Given the two 5-digit numbers \( AMC10 \) and \( AMC12 \), we know their sum is \( 123422 \). We need to determine the value of \( A + M + C \).
  First, we express the given numbers in terms of their digits:
  \[ AMC10 = 10000A + 1000M + 100C + 10 \]
  \[ AMC12 = 10000A + 1000M + 100C + 12 \]
  The sum of these two numbers is:
  \[ (10000A + 1000M + 100C + 10) + (10000A + 1000M + 100C + 12) = 123422 \]
  Simplifying the left-hand side:
  \[ 20000A + 2000M + 200C + 22 = 123422 \]
  Subtracting 22 from both sides:
  \[ 20000A + 2000M + 200C = 123400 \]
  Dividing the entire equation by 200:
  \[ 100A + 10M + C = 617 \]
  Since \( A, M, C \) are digits (0-9), we solve for \( A + M + C \):
  \[ A + M + C = 14 \]
