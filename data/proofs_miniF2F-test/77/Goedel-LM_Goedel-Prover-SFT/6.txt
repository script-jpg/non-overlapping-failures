  Given the sum of the two 5-digit numbers \(AMC10\) and \(AMC12\) is \(123422\), we need to determine \(A + M + C\). We start by expressing the sum of these numbers in a more manageable form. The sum of \(AMC10\) and \(AMC12\) can be written as:
  \[
  (10000A + 1000M + 100C + 10) + (10000A + 1000M + 100C + 20) = 123422
  \]
  Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:
  \[
  20000A + 2000M + 200C + 30 = 123422
  \]
  Subtracting 30 from both sides, we obtain:
  \[
  20000A + 2000M + 200C = 123392
  \]
  Dividing the entire equation by 200, we find:
  \[
  100A + 10M + C = 616.96
  \]
  Since \(A\), \(M\), and \(C\) are integers, the left-hand side must be an integer. Therefore, the right-hand side must also be an integer. Given that \(616.96\) is not an integer, we need to re-evaluate our approach. Instead, we should directly solve the equation for \(A\), \(M\), and \(C\) using the given constraints and the fact that they are digits (0-9).

  -- Normalize the numbers in the hypothesis to simplify the equation.
  norm_num at h₁
  -- Use the fact that A, M, and C are digits to bound them.
  have h₀ := h₀
  -- Use interval_cases to solve the equation under the given constraints.
  interval_cases A <;> interval_cases M <;> interval_cases C <;> omega
