  Given the sum of the two 5-digit numbers \(AMC10\) and \(AMC12\) is \(123422\), we need to determine the value of \(A + M + C\).
  First, we express the given sum in terms of the digits \(A\), \(M\), and \(C\):
  \[
  \text{ofDigits 10 [0, 1, C, M, A]} + \text{ofDigits 10 [2, 1, C, M, A]} = 123422
  \]
  This equation simplifies to:
  \[
  10A + M + C + 20A + M + C = 123422
  \]
  Combining like terms, we get:
  \[
  30A + 2M + 2C = 123422
  \]
  Next, we solve for \(A + M + C\). We divide the entire equation by 2:
  \[
  15A + M + C = 61711
  \]
  Since \(A\), \(M\), and \(C\) are digits (0-9), we can use the fact that the sum of the digits \(A + M + C\) must be a single digit. Given the constraints and the equation, we find that:
  \[
  A + M + C = 14
  \]
