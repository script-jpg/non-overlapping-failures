  Given the sum of the two 5-digit numbers \( AMC10 \) and \( AMC12 \) is \( 123422 \), we need to find \( A + M + C \).
  First, express the numbers \( AMC10 \) and \( AMC12 \) in terms of their digits:
  \[ AMC10 = 10000A + 1000M + 100C + 10 \]
  \[ AMC12 = 10000A + 1000M + 100C + 12 \]
  The sum of these two numbers is:
  \[ (10000A + 1000M + 100C + 10) + (10000A + 1000M + 100C + 12) = 123422 \]
  Simplify the left-hand side:
  \[ 20000A + 2000M + 200C + 22 \]
  Given that \( 20000A + 2000M + 200C = 123400 \), we have:
  \[ 123400 + 22 = 123422 \]
  This confirms the sum is correct. Now, solve for \( A + M + C \):
  \[ 20000A + 2000M + 200C = 123400 \]
  Divide the entire equation by 200:
  \[ 100A + 10M + C = 617 \]
  Since \( A, M, C \) are digits (0-9), we need to find values that satisfy this equation. By inspection or solving the system of equations, we find:
  \[ A = 6, M = 1, C = 7 \]
  Thus:
  \[ A + M + C = 6 + 1 + 7 = 14 \]
