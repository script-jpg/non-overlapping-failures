  Given the sum of the two 5-digit numbers \( AMC10 \) and \( AMC12 \) is \( 123422 \), we need to find the value of \( A + M + C \). The numbers \( AMC10 \) and \( AMC12 \) can be expressed as \( 10000A + 1000M + 100C + 10 \) and \( 10000A + 1000M + 100C + 12 \) respectively. Adding these two numbers gives:
  \[
  (10000A + 1000M + 100C + 10) + (10000A + 1000M + 100C + 12) = 123422
  \]
  Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:
  \[
  20000A + 2000M + 200C + 22 = 123422
  \]
  Subtracting 22 from both sides, we obtain:
  \[
  20000A + 2000M + 200C = 123400
  \]
  Dividing the entire equation by 100, we have:
  \[
  200A + 20M + 2C = 1234
  \]
  Since \( A, M, \) and \( C \) are digits (i.e., integers between 0 and 9), we can solve for \( A + M + C \) by considering the constraints on \( A, M, \) and \( C \). By solving the equation \( 200A + 20M + 2C = 1234 \), we find that \( A + M + C = 14 \).
