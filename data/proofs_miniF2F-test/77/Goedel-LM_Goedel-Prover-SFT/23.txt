  Given the sum of the two 5-digit numbers \(AMC10\) and \(AMC12\) is 123422, we need to find \(A + M + C\).
  First, express the sum in terms of \(A\), \(M\), and \(C\):
  \[
  \text{ofDigits}(10, [0, 1, C, M, A]) + \text{ofDigits}(10, [2, 1, C, M, A]) = 123422
  \]
  This translates to:
  \[
  10A + M + 100C + 10M + A + 102 + 10C + 10M + A = 123422
  \]
  Simplify the equation:
  \[
  11A + 11M + 11C + 102 = 123422
  \]
  Divide both sides by 11:
  \[
  A + M + C + 9 = 12342
  \]
  Since \(A\), \(M\), and \(C\) are single digits, the only solution is:
  \[
  A + M + C = 14
  \]
