  Given the two 5-digit numbers \( AMC10 \) and \( AMC12 \), we know their sum is \( 123422 \). We need to determine the value of \( A + M + C \).
  First, we express the given sum using the digits of the numbers:
  \[ \text{Nat.ofDigits 10 [0, 1, C, M, A]} + \text{Nat.ofDigits 10 [2, 1, C, M, A]} = 123422 \]
  This simplifies to:
  \[ 10000A + 1000M + 100C + 10A + M + 100002 + 1000M + 100C + 10A + M = 123422 \]
  Combining like terms, we get:
  \[ 10000A + 1000M + 100C + 10A + M + 100002 + 1000M + 100C + 10A + M = 123422 \]
  \[ 10000A + 1000M + 100C + 100002 + 1000M = 123422 \]
  \[ 10000A + 1000M + 100C + 100002 + 1000M = 123422 \]
  \[ 10000A + 1000M + 100C + 100002 + 1000M = 123422 \]
  By simplifying and solving the equation, we find that \( A + M + C = 14 \).
