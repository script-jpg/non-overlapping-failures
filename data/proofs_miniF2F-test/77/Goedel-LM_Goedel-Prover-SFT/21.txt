  Given the sum of two 5-digit numbers \( AMC10 \) and \( AMC12 \) is \( 123422 \), we need to determine \( A + M + C \).
  1. Convert the given sum from \( 10 \) to \( 12 \) to \( 10 \) base.
  2. Use the properties of digit addition and the constraints on \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \) to solve for \( A + M + C \).
