  Given the sum of the two 5-digit numbers \( AMC10 \) and \( AMC12 \) is \( 123422 \), we need to find \( A + M + C \).
  First, we express the sum of the two 5-digit numbers in terms of \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \):
  \[
  \text{Sum} = (10000A + 1000M + 100C + 10A + M) + (10000A + 1000M + 100C + 10A + C) = 123422
  \]
  Simplifying the expression, we get:
  \[
  20000A + 2000M + 200C + 20A + M + C = 123422
  \]
  Combining like terms:
  \[
  20200A + 2001M + 201C = 123422
  \]
  Next, we solve for \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \) by isolating each variable. Given the constraints \( A \leq 9 \), \( M \leq 9 \), \( C \leq 9 \), we use the `omega` tactic to solve the system of linear equations.
