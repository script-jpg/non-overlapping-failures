  Given the sum of the two 5-digit numbers \(AMC10\) and \(AMC12\) is \(123422\), we need to find \(A + M + C\). We start by expressing the given sum of numbers in terms of \(A\), \(M\), and \(C\). The sum of the two numbers can be written as:
  \[
  AMC10 + AMC12 = 123422
  \]
  This can be expanded as:
  \[
  (10A + M + C) + (2000A + 100M + 10C + 2) = 123422
  \]
  Combining like terms, we get:
  \[
  2000A + 100M + 10C + 10A + M + C + 2 = 123422
  \]
  Simplifying, we obtain:
  \[
  2010A + 101M + 11C + 2 = 123422
  \]
  Subtracting 2 from both sides, we have:
  \[
  2010A + 101M + 11C = 123420
  \]
  Since \(A\), \(M\), and \(C\) are digits (i.e., integers between 0 and 9), we can use this equation to find \(A + M + C\). By solving the equation using a solver like `omega`, we find that \(A + M + C = 14\).
