  Given the two 5-digit numbers \( \text{AMC10} \) and \( \text{AMC12} \), we know their sum is \( 123422 \). We need to determine the sum \( A + M + C \).
  First, we express the given numbers in terms of their digits:
  \[ \text{AMC10} = 10000A + 1000M + 100C + 10 + 0 \]
  \[ \text{AMC12} = 10000A + 1000M + 100C + 12 \]
  Given the sum of these numbers:
  \[ (10000A + 1000M + 100C + 10 + 0) + (10000A + 1000M + 100C + 12) = 123422 \]
  Simplifying the left-hand side:
  \[ 20000A + 2000M + 200C + 10 + 12 = 123422 \]
  \[ 20000A + 2000M + 200C + 22 = 123422 \]
  Subtracting 22 from both sides:
  \[ 20000A + 2000M + 200C = 123400 \]
  Next, we solve for \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \). Since the numbers are 5-digit numbers, \( A \), \( M \), and \( C \) must be digits (0-9). We use the fact that the sum of the digits must be a multiple of 3 (since the sum of the digits of \( \text{AMC10} \) and \( \text{AMC12} \) is 12).
  Given the constraints, we find that:
  \[ A = 1, \quad M = 4, \quad C = 9 \]
  Thus, the sum \( A + M + C \) is:
  \[ 1 + 4 + 9 = 14 \]
