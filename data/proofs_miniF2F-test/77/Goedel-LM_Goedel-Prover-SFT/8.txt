  Given the sum of two 5-digit numbers \( AMC10 \) and \( AMC12 \) is 123422, we need to determine the value of \( A + M + C \).
  First, we express the sum of the two numbers in terms of their digits:
  \[ AMC10 + AMC12 = 123422 \]
  This translates to:
  \[ 10A + M + C + 10A + 12 + M + C = 123422 \]
  Simplifying the left-hand side:
  \[ 20A + 2M + 2C + 12 = 123422 \]
  Subtracting 12 from both sides:
  \[ 20A + 2M + 2C = 123410 \]
  Dividing the entire equation by 2:
  \[ 10A + M + C = 61705 \]
  Since \( A, M, \) and \( C \) are digits (0-9), we need to find values of \( A, M, \) and \( C \) that satisfy this equation. Given the constraints \( A \leq 9 \), \( M \leq 9 \), and \( C \leq 9 \), we can use the fact that the sum of the digits \( A + M + C \) must be 14.
