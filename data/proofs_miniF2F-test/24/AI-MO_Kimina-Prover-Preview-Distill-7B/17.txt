    -- No matter the tactic is used to solve the equations, it is important that the tactic can solve the equations.
    -- The goal is divided into two parts.
    -- The first part is to prove that $\cos^2{\frac{\pi}{7}}-\cos^2{\frac{2\pi}{7}}+\cos^2{\frac{3\pi}{7}}=\frac{1}{2}$.
    -- The second part is to prove that $\cos^2{\frac{\pi}{7}}+\cos^2{\frac{2\pi}{7}}+\cos^2{\frac{3\pi}{7}}=\frac{3}{2}$.
    -- The two equations are adding up and the two equations are related.
    -- The two equations are multiplied by $3$ and $2$ respectively at the final step.
    -- The reason is that the two equations are related and the final equation is simpler.
    -- The final equation is divided into two parts.
