  To prove that \(\cos{\frac{\pi}{7}} - \cos{\frac{2\pi}{7}} + \cos{\frac{3\pi}{7}} = \frac{1}{2}\), we start by using the properties of the cosine function and the sum-to-product identities. Specifically, we use the fact that \(\cos{x} = \cos{2x} + \cos{3x}\) and the sum-to-product identities for cosine.
  1. We express \(\cos{\frac{\pi}{7}}\), \(\cos{\frac{2\pi}{7}}\), and \(\cos{\frac{3\pi}{7}}\) in terms of \(\cos{\frac{\pi}{7}}\), \(\cos{\frac{2\pi}{7}}\), and \(\cos{\frac{3\pi}{7}}\).
  2. We use the identity \(\cos{x} = \cos{2x} + \cos{3x}\) to rewrite \(\cos{\frac{\pi}{7}}\), \(\cos{\frac{2\pi}{7}}\), and \(\cos{\frac{3\pi}{7}}\).
  3. We simplify the expression using the known values of \(\cos{\frac{\pi}{7}}\), \(\cos{\frac{2\pi}{7}}\), and \(\cos{\frac{3\pi}{7}}\).
  4. Finally, we verify that the simplified expression equals \(\frac{1}{2}\).
