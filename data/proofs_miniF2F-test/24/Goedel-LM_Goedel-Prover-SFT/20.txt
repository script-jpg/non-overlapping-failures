  To prove that \(\cos{\frac{\pi}{7}} - \cos{\frac{2\pi}{7}} + \cos{\frac{3\pi}{7}} = \frac{1}{2}\), we start by expressing the arguments of the cosine function in terms of \(\pi\). We then use the known values of the cosine function at these specific angles.
  1. Convert the angles \(\frac{\pi}{7}\), \(\frac{2\pi}{7}\), and \(\frac{3\pi}{7}\) into known values.
  2. Use the properties of the cosine function to simplify the expression.
  3. Apply the known values of the cosine function at these angles.
  4. Simplify the resulting expression to obtain the final result.
