  To prove that \(\cos{\frac{\pi}{7}} - \cos{\frac{2\pi}{7}} + \cos{\frac{3\pi}{7}} = \frac{1}{2}\), we start by using the known trigonometric identities for the cosine of specific angles. Specifically, we use the identity \(\cos(x) = \cos(2x - x)\) and the sum-to-product formulas for cosine. We then simplify the resulting expressions step by step, using algebraic manipulations and known trigonometric identities, to arrive at the desired result.
