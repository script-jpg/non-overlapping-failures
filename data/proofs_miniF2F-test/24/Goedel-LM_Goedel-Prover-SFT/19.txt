  To prove that \(\cos{\frac{\pi}{7}} - \cos{\frac{2\pi}{7}} + \cos{\frac{3\pi}{7}} = \frac{1}{2}\), we start by using the trigonometric identity for the cosine of a sum and a difference. Specifically, we use the identity \(\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B\) and \(\cos(A - B) = \cos A \cos B + \sin A \sin B\).
  1. Express \(\cos{\frac{2\pi}{7}}\) and \(\cos{\frac{3\pi}{7}}\) in terms of \(\cos{\frac{\pi}{7}}\) and \(\sin{\frac{\pi}{7}}\).
  2. Substitute these expressions into the original equation.
  3. Simplify the resulting expression using algebraic manipulations.
  4. Use the fact that \(\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1\) to further simplify the expression.
  5. Verify that the simplified expression equals \(\frac{1}{2}\).
