  To prove that \(\cos{\frac{\pi}{7}} - \cos{\frac{2\pi}{7}} + \cos{\frac{3\pi}{7}} = \frac{1}{2}\), we start by expressing the angles in terms of \(\pi\). We then use the known trigonometric identities for the cosine of specific angles. Specifically, we use the identity for \(\cos{\frac{\pi}{7}}\), \(\cos{\frac{2\pi}{7}}\), and \(\cos{\frac{3\pi}{7}}\). By substituting these identities and simplifying, we arrive at the desired result.
