  To prove that \(\cos{\frac{\pi}{7}} - \cos{\frac{2\pi}{7}} + \cos{\frac{3\pi}{7}} = \frac{1}{2}\), we start by expressing each cosine term using the known trigonometric identities for the angles \(\frac{\pi}{7}\), \(\frac{2\pi}{7}\), and \(\frac{3\pi}{7}\). We then simplify the resulting expression step by step, using algebraic manipulations and known trigonometric identities.
