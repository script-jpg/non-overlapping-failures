  To prove that \(\cos{\frac{\pi}{7}} - \cos{\frac{2\pi}{7}} + \cos{\frac{3\pi}{7}} = \frac{1}{2}\), we start by using the trigonometric identity for the sum of angles. Specifically, we use the identity \(\cos(a) = \cos(b) \cos(a - b) + \sin(a) \sin(b)\). By applying this identity, we can express \(\cos{\frac{2\pi}{7}}\) and \(\cos{\frac{3\pi}{7}}\) in terms of \(\cos{\frac{\pi}{7}}\) and \(\sin{\frac{\pi}{7}}\). After simplifying the resulting expressions, we combine them to show that the sum equals \(\frac{1}{2}\).
