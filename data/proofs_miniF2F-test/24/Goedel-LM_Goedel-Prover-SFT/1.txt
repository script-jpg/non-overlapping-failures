  To prove that \(\cos{\frac{\pi}{7}} - \cos{\frac{2\pi}{7}} + \cos{\frac{3\pi}{7}} = \frac{1}{2}\), we start by expressing the angles in terms of known trigonometric identities. We use the fact that \(\cos{\frac{\pi}{7}}\), \(\cos{\frac{2\pi}{7}}\), and \(\cos{\frac{3\pi}{7}}\) can be related to the cosine of \(\pi/7\) through specific angle calculations. Specifically, we use the identity for the cosine of a sum, difference, and multiple angles. By simplifying the expressions and applying known trigonometric identities, we can derive the desired result.
