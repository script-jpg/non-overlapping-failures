  To prove that \(\cos{\frac{\pi}{7}} - \cos{\frac{2\pi}{7}} + \cos{\frac{3\pi}{7}} = \frac{1}{2}\), we start by using the known trigonometric identities for the cosine of specific angles. Specifically, we use the identity for the cosine of a sum and a difference of angles. We then simplify the resulting expressions using algebraic manipulation and known trigonometric identities. Finally, we combine the terms and simplify to obtain the desired result.
