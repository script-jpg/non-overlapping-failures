  To prove that \(\cos{\frac{\pi}{7}} - \cos{\frac{2\pi}{7}} + \cos{\frac{3\pi}{7}} = \frac{1}{2}\), we can use the properties of the cosine function and the symmetry of the arguments. Specifically, we can use the identity \(\cos(x) = \cos(-x)\) and the known values of the cosine function at specific angles.
  1. We start by expressing the given expression in terms of a known value.
  2. We use the fact that \(\cos(x) = \cos(-x)\) to simplify the terms.
  3. We then use the known values of the cosine function at specific angles to simplify the expression.
  4. Finally, we verify that the simplified expression equals \(\frac{1}{2}\).
