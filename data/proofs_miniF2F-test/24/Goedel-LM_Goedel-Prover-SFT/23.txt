  To prove that \(\cos{\frac{\pi}{7}} - \cos{\frac{2\pi}{7}} + \cos{\frac{3\pi}{7}} = \frac{1}{2}\), we can use the properties of the cosine function and the roots of unity. Specifically, we will use the fact that the cosine of a multiple of \(\pi\) is 1, and the cosine of \(\pi\) is -1. We will also use the fact that the sum of the roots of the polynomial \(x^3 - x^2 + x - 1 = 0\) is 1.
