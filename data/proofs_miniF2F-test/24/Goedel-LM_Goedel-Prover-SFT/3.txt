  To prove that \(\cos{\frac{\pi}{7}} - \cos{\frac{2\pi}{7}} + \cos{\frac{3\pi}{7}} = \frac{1}{2}\), we use the properties of the cosine function and the given values of the angles involved. Specifically, we know that \(\cos{\frac{\pi}{7}}\), \(\cos{\frac{2\pi}{7}}\), and \(\cos{\frac{3\pi}{7}}\) are specific values that can be directly computed. By evaluating these values and substituting them into the expression, we can verify the equality.
