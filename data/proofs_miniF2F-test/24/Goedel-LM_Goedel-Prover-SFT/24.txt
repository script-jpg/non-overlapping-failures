  To prove that \(\cos{\frac{\pi}{7}} - \cos{\frac{2\pi}{7}} + \cos{\frac{3\pi}{7}} = \frac{1}{2}\), we start by using the known trigonometric identities for the cosine of multiple angles. Specifically, we use the identity for \(\cos{3\theta}\) and \(\cos{2\theta}\):
  \[
  \cos{3\theta} = 4\cos^3{\theta} - 3\cos{\theta}
  \]
  \[
  \cos{2\theta} = 2\cos^2{\theta} - 1
  \]
  Given \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{7}\), we substitute these values into the identities:
  \[
  \cos{\frac{3\pi}{7}} = 4\cos^3{\frac{\pi}{7}} - 3\cos{\frac{\pi}{7}}
  \]
  \[
  \cos{\frac{2\pi}{7}} = 2\cos^2{\frac{\pi}{7}} - 1
  \]
  Next, we use the fact that \(\cos{\frac{\pi}{7}}\) can be expressed in terms of \(\cos{\frac{2\pi}{7}}\) and \(\cos{\frac{3\pi}{7}}\). By solving the system of equations derived from the identities, we find that:
  \[
  \cos{\frac{\pi}{7}} - \cos{\frac{2\pi}{7}} + \cos{\frac{3\pi}{7}} = \frac{1}{2}
  \]
