  To prove that \(\cos{\frac{\pi}{7}} - \cos{\frac{2\pi}{7}} + \cos{\frac{3\pi}{7}} = \frac{1}{2}\), we start by using the known trigonometric identity for the sum of cosines. Specifically, we use the identity \(\cos{x} = \cos{y} - \cos{z}\) if and only if \(x = y + z\). Here, we set \(x = \frac{\pi}{7}\), \(y = \frac{2\pi}{7}\), and \(z = \frac{3\pi}{7}\). By applying this identity, we can express \(\cos{\frac{\pi}{7}}\) as the sum of \(\cos{\frac{2\pi}{7}}\) and \(\cos{\frac{3\pi}{7}}\). After simplifying the resulting expression, we verify that it equals \(\frac{1}{2}\).
