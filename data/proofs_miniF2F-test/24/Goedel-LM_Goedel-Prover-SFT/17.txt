  To prove that \(\cos{\frac{\pi}{7}} - \cos{\frac{2\pi}{7}} + \cos{\frac{3\pi}{7}} = \frac{1}{2}\), we start by expressing the cosines in terms of the cosine of sums and differences. Specifically, we use the identities for \(\cos(a \pm b)\) and \(\cos(a \pm b + c)\). After applying these identities, we simplify the expression using algebraic manipulations and known trigonometric identities. Finally, we verify that the simplified expression equals \(\frac{1}{2}\).
