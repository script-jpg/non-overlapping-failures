The key insight is that within the interval $p \leq x \leq 15$, the expressions $x-p \geq 0$, $x-15 \leq 0$, and $x-p-15 \leq 0$ hold true. This allows us to simplify the absolute value expressions without their signs.

In our proof, we established:
- $x-p \geq 0$ (since $x \geq p$)
- $x-15 \leq 0$ (since $x \leq 15$)
- $x-p-15 \leq 0$ (since $x \leq 15$ and $p > 0$)

Using these facts, we removed the absolute value signs from each term:
- $|x-p| = x-p$ because $x-p \geq 0$
- $|x-15| = -(x-15) = 15-x$ because $x-15 \leq 0$
- $|x-p-15| = -(x-p-15) = p+15-x$ because $x-p-15 \leq 0$

Therefore, $f(x) = (x-p) + (15-x) + (p+15-x) = x-p + 15-x + p+15-x = 30-x$.

Since $x \leq 15$, we have $30-x \geq 30-15 = 15$. Thus, $f(x) \geq 15$.

The minimum value of $f(x)$ occurs when $x = 15$, yielding $f(15) = |15-p| + |15-15| + |15-p-15| = |15-p| + 0 + |p| = 15-p + p = 15$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $f(x)$ on the interval $p \leq x \leq 15$ is 15.
