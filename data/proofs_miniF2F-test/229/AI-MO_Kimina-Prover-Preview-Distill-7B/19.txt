In this problem, we are given a function $f(x) = |x-p| + |x-15| + |x-p-15|$, where $0 < p < 15$, and we need to find the minimum value of $f(x)$ on the interval $p \leq x \leq 15$.

First, let's analyze the structure of $f(x)$. We have three absolute value terms:

1. $|x-p|$: This represents the distance between $x$ and $p$.
2. $|x-15|$: This represents the distance between $x$ and 15.
3. $|x-p-15|$: This represents the distance between $x$ and $p+15$.

Given the constraints $0 < p < 15$ and $p \leq x \leq 15$, let's think about how to simplify these absolute values:

- Since $x \geq p$, we have $x-p \geq 0$, so $|x-p| = x-p$.
- Since $x \leq 15$, we have $x-15 \leq 0$, so $|x-15| = -(x-15) = 15-x$.
- Since $x \leq 15$ and $p > 0$, we have $x-p-15 \leq 15-p-15 = -p < 0$, so $|x-p-15| = -(x-p-15) = p+15-x$.

Therefore, we can rewrite $f(x)$ as:
$f(x) = (x-p) + (15-x) + (p+15-x) = x-p + 15-x + p+15-x = 30-x$

To find the minimum value of $f(x)$ on $p \leq x \leq 15$, we note that $f(x) = 30-x$ is a decreasing function. Therefore, the minimum occurs at the right endpoint of the interval, which is $x=15$.

Calculating $f(15) = 30 - 15 = 15$.

Therefore, the minimum value of $f(x)$ on $p \leq x \leq 15$ is 15.

The Lean proof formalizes this analysis as follows:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

We start by importing the necessary libraries and setting up the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem aime_1983_p2 (x p : ℝ) (f : ℝ → ℝ) (h₀ : 0 < p ∧ p < 15) (h₁ : p ≤ x ∧ x ≤ 15)
    (h₂ : f x = abs (x - p) + abs (x - 15) + abs (x - p - 15)) : 15 ≤ f x := by
```

We have:
- $0 < p < 15$ (from h₀)
- $p \leq x \leq 15$ (from h₁)
- $f(x) = |x-p| + |x-15| + |x-p-15|$ (from h₂)

From our analysis:
- $|x-p| = x-p$ (since $x \geq p$)
- $|x-15| = 15-x$ (since $x \leq 15$)
- $|x-p-15| = p+15-x$ (since $x \leq 15$ and $p > 0$)

So $f(x) = (x-p) + (15-x) + (p+15-x) = 30-x$

Since $f(x) = 30-x$ is decreasing on $p \leq x \leq 15$, the minimum is at $x=15$, giving $f(15) = 30-15 = 15$.

Now, let's complete the Lean proof:

```tactics
have hp : 0 < p := h₀.1
have p_lt_15 : p < 15 := h₀.2

have h₃ : x - p ≥ 0 := by linarith [h₁.1]
have h₄ : x - 15 ≤ 0 := by linarith [h₁.2]
have h₅ : x - p - 15 ≤ 0 := by linarith [h₁.2]; linarith

rw [abs_of_nonneg h₃, abs_of_nonpos h₄, abs_of_nonpos h₅] at h₂

linarith
```

The Lean proof confirms that $15 \leq f(x)$ for all $x$ in $p \leq x \leq 15$, with equality achieved at $x=15$. Thus, the minimum value is 15.
