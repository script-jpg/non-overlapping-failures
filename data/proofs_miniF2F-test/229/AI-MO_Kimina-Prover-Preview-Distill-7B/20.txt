-- We will show that the minimum value of $f(x)$ on the interval $[p, 15]$ is 15.
  -- First, let's analyze the structure of $f(x) = |x-p| + |x-15| + |x-p-15|$.

  -- Since $0 < p < 15$, we have $p < 15$, and thus $x - p \geq 0$ for $x \in [p, 15]$.
  have hp : 0 < p := h₀.1
  have hp_lt_15 : p < 15 := h₀.2
  have hxp : x - p ≥ 0 := by linarith

  -- For $x \in [p, 15]$, we have $x - 15 \leq 0$.
  have hx15 : x - 15 ≤ 0 := by linarith

  -- For $x \in [p, 15]$, we also have $x - p - 15 \leq 0$ because $x \leq 15$ and $p > 0$.
  have hxpp15 : x - p - 15 ≤ 0 := by linarith

  -- Let's evaluate each absolute value term in $f(x)$:
  -- - $|x-p| = x-p$ because $x-p \geq 0$
  have abs_xmpp : abs (x - p) = x - p := by
    rw [abs_eq_self]
    linarith

  -- - $|x-15| = -(x-15) = 15-x$ because $x-15 \leq 0$
  have abs_x15 : abs (x - 15) = -(x - 15) := by
    rw [abs_eq_neg_self]
    linarith

  -- - $|x-p-15| = -(x-p-15) = p+15-x$ because $x-p-15 \leq 0$
  have abs_xpp15 : abs (x - p - 15) = -(x - p - 15) := by
    rw [abs_eq_neg_self]
    linarith

  -- Substituting these into $f(x)$:
  have : f x = (x - p) + (-(x - 15)) + (-(x - p - 15)) := by
    rw [h₂, abs_xmpp, abs_x15, abs_xpp15]

  -- Simplifying: $f(x) = (x-p) + (15-x) + (p+15-x) = 15 - x + p + 15 - x + p = 30 - 2x + 2p$
  have : f x = 30 - 2 * x + 2 * p := by
    rw [this]
    ring

  -- To find the minimum value of $f(x)$ on $[p, 15]$, we observe that $f(x)$ is linear in $x$ with a negative slope (-2).
  -- Therefore, $f(x)$ is minimized at $x = 15$.
  -- Calculating $f(15) = |15-p| + |15-15| + |15-p-15| = |15-p| + 0 + |p| = 15-p + p = 15$.
  have : f x ≥ 15 := by
    rw [this]

  -- Hence, the minimum value of $f(x)$ on $[p, 15]$ is 15.
