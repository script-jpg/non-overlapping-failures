-- -- Simplify the absolute value expressions in `h₂` using the inequalities in `h₀` and `h₁`.
  have h₃ : x - p ≥ 0 := by linarith
  have h₄ : x - 15 ≤ 0 := by linarith
  have h₅ : x - p - 15 ≤ 0 := by linarith

  rw [h₂]
  simp [abs_of_nonneg h₃, abs_of_nonpos h₄, abs_of_nonpos h₅]

  -- After simplification, we can easily prove the goal using linear arithmetic.
