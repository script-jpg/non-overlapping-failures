  To determine the minimum value taken by \( f(x) = |x - p| + |x - 15| + |x - p - 15| \) for \( x \) in the interval \( p \leq x \leq 15 \), we need to analyze the behavior of the absolute value functions. Given that \( 0 < p < 15 \), we can break down the problem into different cases based on the values of \( x \) relative to \( p \) and 15.
  1. **Case Analysis**:
     - If \( x \geq 15 \), then \( |x - p| = x - p \), \( |x - 15| = x - 15 \), and \( |x - p - 15| = x - p - 15 \).
     - If \( x \leq p \), then \( |x - p| = p - x \), \( |x - 15| = 15 - x \), and \( |x - p - 15| = p + 15 - x \).
     - If \( p \leq x \leq 15 \), then \( |x - p| = x - p \), \( |x - 15| = 15 - x \), and \( |x - p - 15| = p + 15 - x \).
  2. **Combining Results**:
     - By combining the results from the different cases, we can determine the minimum value of \( f(x) \).
