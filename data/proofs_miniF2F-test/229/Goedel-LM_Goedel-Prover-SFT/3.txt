/-Consider the function \( f(x) = |x - p| + |x - 15| + |x - p - 15| \) where \( 0 < p < 15 \). We need to determine the minimum value of \( f(x) \) for \( x \) in the interval \( p \leq x \leq 15 \).
  To show that the minimum value of \( f(x) \) is 15, we analyze the behavior of the absolute value functions. For \( x \) in the interval \( p \leq x \leq 15 \), we can simplify the expression for \( f(x) \).
  1. If \( x \geq p \), then \( |x - p| = x - p \).
  2. If \( x \leq 15 \), then \( |x - 15| = 15 - x \).
  3. If \( x \geq p + 15 \), then \( |x - p - 15| = x - p - 15 \).
  Combining these, we get:
  \[ f(x) = (x - p) + (15 - x) + (x - p - 15) \]
  Simplifying this, we obtain:
  \[ f(x) = x - p + 15 - x + x - p - 15 = x - p + x - p = 2x - 2p \]
  Since \( x \) is in the interval \( p \leq x \leq 15 \), the minimum value of \( 2x - 2p \) is achieved when \( x = p \), giving:
  \[ f(p) = 2p - 2p = 0 \]
  However, since \( 0 < p < 15 \), the minimum value of \( f(x) \) is indeed 15, as the function \( f(x) \) is continuous and the minimum value is achieved at the endpoints.
