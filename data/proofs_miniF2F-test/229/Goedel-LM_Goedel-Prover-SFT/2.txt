  To determine the minimum value of \( f(x) \) for \( x \) in the interval \( p \leq x \leq 15 \), we need to analyze the function \( f(x) = |x - p| + |x - 15| + |x - p - 15| \). Given the constraints \( 0 < p < 15 \) and \( p \leq x \leq 15 \), we can break down the function into different cases based on the values of \( x \) relative to \( p \) and \( 15 \).
  1. **Case Analysis**:
     - If \( x \leq p \), then \( |x - p| = p - x \), \( |x - 15| = 15 - x \), and \( |x - p - 15| = x - p - 15 \).
     - If \( p < x \leq 15 \), then \( |x - p| = x - p \), \( |x - 15| = 15 - x \), and \( |x - p - 15| = x - p - 15 \).
     - If \( x > 15 \), then \( |x - p| = x - p \), \( |x - 15| = x - 15 \), and \( |x - p - 15| = x - p - 15 \).
  By analyzing these cases, we can see that the minimum value of \( f(x) \) occurs when \( x = 15 \), as it simplifies to \( f(15) = |15 - p| + |15 - 15| + |15 - p - 15| = |15 - p| + 0 + |0| = |15 - p| \).
  Since \( 0 < p < 15 \), the minimum value of \( |15 - p| \) is 0, which occurs when \( p = 15 \). However, since \( p \leq x \leq 15 \), the minimum value of \( f(x) \) is actually achieved when \( x = 15 \), and the value is 15.
