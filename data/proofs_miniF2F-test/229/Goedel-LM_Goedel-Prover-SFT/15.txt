  To determine the minimum value of the function \( f(x) = |x - p| + |x - 15| + |x - p - 15| \) for \( x \) in the interval \( p \leq x \leq 15 \), we need to analyze the behavior of the absolute value functions. The function \( f(x) \) consists of three absolute value terms. By considering the properties of absolute values, we can simplify the expression and find the minimum value.

  cases' le_total 0 (x - p - 15) with h'' h'' <;>
  -- Simplify the absolute values based on the conditions.
