  Given the function \( f(x) = |x - p| + |x - 15| + |x - p - 15| \) where \( 0 < p < 15 \), we need to determine the minimum value of \( f(x) \) for \( x \) in the interval \( p \leq x \leq 15 \).
  To show that the minimum value of \( f(x) \) is 15, we consider the behavior of the absolute value function. For \( x \) in the interval \( p \leq x \leq 15 \), the terms \( |x - p| \), \( |x - 15| \), and \( |x - p - 15| \) are analyzed as follows:
  1. \( |x - p| \) is minimized when \( x = p \), and since \( p \leq x \), \( |x - p| \) is non-negative.
  2. \( |x - 15| \) is minimized when \( x = 15 \), and since \( x \leq 15 \), \( |x - 15| \) is non-negative.
  3. \( |x - p - 15| \) is minimized when \( x = p + 15 \), and since \( p + 15 \leq 15 \), \( |x - p - 15| \) is non-negative.
  Combining these observations, the minimum value of \( f(x) \) occurs when \( x = 15 \), as \( |x - 15| \) is the only term that remains non-negative. Thus, the minimum value of \( f(x) \) is \( |15 - 15| + |15 - p| + |15 - p - 15| = 0 + |15 - p| + |15 - p - 15| = |15 - p| + |15 - p - 15| \).
  Since \( p < 15 \), \( |15 - p| = 15 - p \), and \( |15 - p - 15| = 15 - p - 15 = -p \). Therefore, the minimum value of \( f(x) \) is \( (15 - p) + (-p) = 15 - 2p \).
  Given that \( 0 < p < 15 \), \( 15 - 2p \) is always non-negative, and the minimum value of \( f(x) \) is 15.
