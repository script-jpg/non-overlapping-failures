  -- We are able to do this because we know that $7y = 10z$ and $2x = 5y$, so by transitivity, $2x = 10z$.

  -- Dividing both sides by $10x$, we get $\frac{z}{x} = \frac{2}{10} = \frac{1}{5}$.

  -- Now, all we have to do is to show that $\frac{1}{5} = \frac{7}{25}$, and we can do this by cross multiplication.
