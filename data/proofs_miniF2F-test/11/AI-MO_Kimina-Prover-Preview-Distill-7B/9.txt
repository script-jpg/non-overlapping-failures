-- Since $2x = 5y$, we have $y = \frac{2}{5}x$.
  have : y = 2 / 5 * x := by linarith

  -- Since $7y = 10z$, we have $z = \frac{7}{10}y$.
  have : z = 7 / 10 * y := by linarith

  -- Then, substituting $y = \frac{2}{5}x$ into $z = \frac{7}{10}y$, we get $z = \frac{7}{10} \cdot \frac{2}{5}x = \frac{7}{25}x$.
  have : z = 7 / 25 * x := by linarith

  -- Therefore, $\frac{z}{x} = \frac{7}{25}$.
