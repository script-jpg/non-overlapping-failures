-- To find the value of $\frac{z}{x}$, we need to relate $z$ and $x$ directly.

  -- From $2x = 5y$, we get $y = \frac{2}{5}x$.
  have h₃ : y = 2 / 5 * x := by linarith

  -- From $7y = 10z$, we get $z = \frac{7}{10}y$.
  have h₄ : z = 7 / 10 * y := by linarith

  -- Substituting $y = \frac{2}{5}x$ into $z = \frac{7}{10}y$, we get:
  have h₅ : z = 7 / 10 * (2 / 5 * x) := by rw [h₄, h₃]

  -- Simplifying, we find $z = \frac{7}{25}x$.
  have h₆ : z = 7 / 25 * x := by linarith

  -- Therefore, $\frac{z}{x} = \frac{7}{25}$.
  have h₇ : z / x = 7 / 25 := by
