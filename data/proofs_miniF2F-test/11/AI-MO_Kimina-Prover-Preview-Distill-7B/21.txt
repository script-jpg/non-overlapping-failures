-- To find $\frac{z}{x}$, we first need to express $z$ in terms of $x$.

  -- From $2x = 5y$, we can solve for $y$ in terms of $x$:
  -- $y = \frac{2x}{5}$
  have eq1 : y = 2 / 5 * x := by
    linarith

  -- Substituting $y = \frac{2x}{5}$ into $7y = 10z$:
  -- $7 \cdot \frac{2x}{5} = 10z$
  -- $\frac{14x}{5} = 10z$
  -- $z = \frac{14x}{50} = \frac{7x}{25}$
  have eq2 : z = 7 / 25 * x := by

  -- Therefore, $\frac{z}{x} = \frac{\frac{7x}{25}}{x} = \frac{7}{25}$ since $x \neq 0$

  -- This shows that $\frac{z}{x} = \frac{7}{25}$
