-- We have $2x = 5y$ and $7y = 10z$. We need to find $\frac{z}{x}$.

  -- From $2x = 5y$, we get $y = \frac{2}{5}x$.

  -- From $7y = 10z$, we get $z = \frac{7}{10}y$.
  have hz : z = 7 / 10 * y := by linarith

  -- Substituting $y = \frac{2}{5}x$ into $z = \frac{7}{10}y$, we get $z = \frac{7}{10} \cdot \frac{2}{5}x = \frac{7}{25}x$.
