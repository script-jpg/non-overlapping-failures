-- The goal is to find $z / x$ given $2x = 5y$ and $7y = 10z$.

  -- First, we have to express $z$ in terms of $x$. It is not directly given, but we can express $y$ in terms of $x$ using the first equation.

  have h₃ : y = 2 / 5 * x := by linarith

  -- We have $y = \frac{2}{5}x$. Now, substitute this into the second equation $7y = 10z$ to express $z$ in terms of $x$.

  have h₄ : z = 7 / 10 * y := by linarith

  rw [h₃] at h₄

  -- Now, $z = \frac{7}{10} \cdot \frac{2}{5}x = \frac{7}{25}x$.

  have h₅ : z = 7 / 25 * x := by linarith

  -- To find $\frac{z}{x}$, we have $\frac{z}{x} = \frac{\frac{7}{25}x}{x} = \frac{7}{25}$ since $x \neq 0$.

  have h₆ : z / x = 7 / 25 := by
    have : z / x = (7 / 25 * x) / x := by rw [h₅]
