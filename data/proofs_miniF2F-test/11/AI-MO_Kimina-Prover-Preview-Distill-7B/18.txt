-- To find $\frac{z}{x}$, we first need to express $z$ in terms of $x$.

  -- We have $2x = 5y$, so $y = \frac{2}{5}x$.
  have h₁' : y = 2 / 5 * x := by linarith

  -- Then, substituting $y = \frac{2}{5}x$ into $7y = 10z$, we get $7 \cdot \frac{2}{5}x = 10z$.
  have h₂' : 7 * (2 / 5 * x) = 10 * z := by rwa [h₁'] at h₂

  -- Simplifying $7 \cdot \frac{2}{5}x = 10z$ gives us $\frac{14}{5}x = 10z$.
  have h₃ : 14 / 5 * x = 10 * z := by linarith

  -- From $\frac{14}{5}x = 10z$, we can solve for $z$ in terms of $x$: $z = \frac{14}{50}x = \frac{7}{25}x$.
  have h₄ : z = 7 / 25 * x := by
    linarith

  -- Therefore, $\frac{z}{x} = \frac{7}{25}$.
