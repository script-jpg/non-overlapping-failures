  Given the equations \(2x = 5y\) and \(7y = 10z\), we need to find the value of \(\frac{z}{x}\) in a common fraction form. We start by expressing \(x\) and \(z\) in terms of \(y\) using the given equations. From \(2x = 5y\), we get \(x = \frac{5y}{2}\). From \(7y = 10z\), we get \(z = \frac{7y}{10}\). To find the ratio \(\frac{z}{x}\), we substitute the expressions for \(x\) and \(z\):
  \[
  \frac{z}{x} = \frac{\frac{7y}{10}}{\frac{5y}{2}} = \frac{7y}{10} \cdot \frac{2}{5y} = \frac{7 \cdot 2}{10 \cdot 5} = \frac{14}{50} = \frac{7}{25}
  \]
  Thus, the value of \(\frac{z}{x}\) is \(\frac{7}{25}\).
