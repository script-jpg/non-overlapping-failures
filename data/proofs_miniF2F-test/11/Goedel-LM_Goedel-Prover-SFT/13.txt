  Given the equations \(2x = 5y\) and \(7y = 10z\), we need to find the value of \(\frac{z}{x}\) expressed as a common fraction.
  1. Start by isolating \(y\) in terms of \(x\) using the first equation:
     \[
     y = \frac{2x}{5}
     \]
  2. Substitute \(y\) into the second equation:
     \[
     7 \left(\frac{2x}{5}\right) = 10z
     \]
  3. Simplify the equation to solve for \(z\):
     \[
     \frac{14x}{5} = 10z \implies z = \frac{14x}{50} = \frac{7x}{25}
     \]
  4. To find the value of \(\frac{z}{x}\), substitute \(z\) back into the expression:
     \[
     \frac{z}{x} = \frac{\frac{7x}{25}}{x} = \frac{7}{25}
     \]
  Thus, the value of \(\frac{z}{x}\) is \(\frac{7}{25}\).
