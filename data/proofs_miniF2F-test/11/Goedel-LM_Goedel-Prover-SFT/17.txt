  Given the equations \(2x = 5y\) and \(7y = 10z\), we need to find the value of \(\frac{z}{x}\) expressed as a common fraction. We will show that it is \(\frac{7}{25}\).
  1. Start by expressing \(z\) in terms of \(y\) using the second equation:
     \[
     z = \frac{7y}{10}
     \]
  2. Substitute \(z = \frac{7y}{10}\) into the expression \(\frac{z}{x}\):
     \[
     \frac{z}{x} = \frac{\frac{7y}{10}}{x} = \frac{7y}{10x}
     \]
  3. To find the ratio \(\frac{y}{x}\), use the first equation \(2x = 5y\):
     \[
     \frac{y}{x} = \frac{2x}{5x} = \frac{2}{5}
     \]
  4. Substitute \(\frac{y}{x} = \frac{2}{5}\) into the expression \(\frac{7y}{10x}\):
     \[
     \frac{7y}{10x} = \frac{7 \cdot \frac{2}{5} \cdot x}{10x} = \frac{7 \cdot \frac{2}{5}}{10} = \frac{7 \cdot 2}{5 \cdot 10} = \frac{14}{50} = \frac{7}{25}
     \]
  Thus, the value of \(\frac{z}{x}\) is \(\frac{7}{25}\).
