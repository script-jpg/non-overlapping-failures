  Given the equations \(2x = 5y\) and \(7y = 10z\), we need to find the value of \(\frac{z}{x}\) expressed as a common fraction.
  1. Start with the equation \(2x = 5y\).
  2. Substitute \(y\) from the first equation into the second equation \(7y = 10z\).
  3. Solve for \(z\) in terms of \(x\).
  4. Simplify the resulting expression to find \(\frac{z}{x}\).

  -- We know that x ≠ 0 from the given condition h₀.
  have x_nonzero : x ≠ 0 := by
    intro x_zero
    rw [x_zero] at h₀
    contradiction
  -- Simplify the fraction z/x by clearing the denominator using field_simp.
  field_simp [x_nonzero]
  -- Use linarith to solve the resulting linear equations.
