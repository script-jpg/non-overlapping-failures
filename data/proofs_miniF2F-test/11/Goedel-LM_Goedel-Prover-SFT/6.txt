  Given the equations \(2x = 5y\) and \(7y = 10z\), we need to find the value of \(\frac{z}{x}\) expressed as a common fraction. We start by manipulating the given equations to isolate \(z\) in terms of \(x\).
  First, solve for \(y\) in terms of \(x\) using the first equation:
  \[ y = \frac{2x}{5} \]
  Next, substitute \(y\) into the second equation to solve for \(z\):
  \[ 7 \left(\frac{2x}{5}\right) = 10z \]
  \[ \frac{14x}{5} = 10z \]
  \[ z = \frac{14x}{50} \]
  \[ z = \frac{7x}{25} \]
  Thus, the value of \(\frac{z}{x}\) is:
  \[ \frac{z}{x} = \frac{\frac{7x}{25}}{x} = \frac{7}{25} \]
