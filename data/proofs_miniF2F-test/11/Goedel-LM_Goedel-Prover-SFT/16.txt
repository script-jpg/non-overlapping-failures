  Given the equations \(2x = 5y\) and \(7y = 10z\), we need to find the value of \(\frac{z}{x}\) and show that it is \(\frac{7}{25}\).
  1. Start by expressing \(y\) in terms of \(x\) using the first equation: \(y = \frac{2x}{5}\).
  2. Substitute \(y = \frac{2x}{5}\) into the second equation: \(7 \left(\frac{2x}{5}\right) = 10z\).
  3. Simplify the equation to solve for \(z\): \(z = \frac{7x}{25}\).
  4. Therefore, \(\frac{z}{x} = \frac{\frac{7x}{25}}{x} = \frac{7}{25}\).
