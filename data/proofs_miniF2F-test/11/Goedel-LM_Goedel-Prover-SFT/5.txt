  Given the equations \(2x = 5y\) and \(7y = 10z\), we need to find the value of \(\frac{z}{x}\).
  First, solve \(2x = 5y\) for \(y\):
  \[ y = \frac{2x}{5} \]
  Next, solve \(7y = 10z\) for \(z\):
  \[ z = \frac{7y}{10} \]
  Substitute \(y\) from the previous step into the equation for \(z\):
  \[ z = \frac{7 \left(\frac{2x}{5}\right)}{10} = \frac{14x}{50} = \frac{7x}{25} \]
  Now, compute \(\frac{z}{x}\):
  \[ \frac{z}{x} = \frac{\frac{7x}{25}}{x} = \frac{7}{25} \]
  Thus, the value of \(\frac{z}{x}\) is \(\frac{7}{25}\).
