  Given the equations \(2x = 5y\) and \(7y = 10z\), we need to find the value of \(\frac{z}{x}\).
  1. From \(2x = 5y\), we can express \(y\) in terms of \(x\):
     \[
     y = \frac{2x}{5}
     \]
  2. Substitute \(y = \frac{2x}{5}\) into \(7y = 10z\):
     \[
     7 \left(\frac{2x}{5}\right) = 10z
     \]
  3. Simplify the equation:
     \[
     \frac{14x}{5} = 10z
     \]
  4. Solve for \(z\) by multiplying both sides by \(\frac{5}{10}\):
     \[
     z = \frac{14x}{50} = \frac{7x}{25}
     \]
  5. Therefore, the value of \(\frac{z}{x}\) is:
     \[
     \frac{z}{x} = \frac{\frac{7x}{25}}{x} = \frac{7}{25}
     \]
