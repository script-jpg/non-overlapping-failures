  We aim to show that for all natural numbers \( n \), the sum of the cubes of the first \( n \) natural numbers is equal to the square of the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers. That is, we need to prove that:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k^3 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2
  \]
  We will use mathematical induction to establish this result.
  1. **Base Case**: When \( n = 0 \), both sides of the equation are zero.
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds for some \( n \), and we need to show it holds for \( n + 1 \).
     - The sum of the cubes of the first \( n + 1 \) natural numbers can be written as:
       \[
       \sum_{k=0}^{n} k^3 = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k^3 + n^3
       \]
     - The sum of the cubes of the first \( n + 1 \) natural numbers is also:
       \[
       \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n} k \right)^2 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k + n \right)^2
       \]
     - Using the inductive hypothesis, we know:
       \[
       \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k^3 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2
       \]
     - Therefore, we have:
       \[
       \sum_{k=0}^{n} k^3 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k + n \right)^2
       \]
     - Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:
       \[
       \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k + n \right)^2 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2 + 2n \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right) + n^2
       \]
     - Since \( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \) is a natural number, the equation holds true.
  Thus, by mathematical induction, the statement is proven for all natural numbers \( n \).
