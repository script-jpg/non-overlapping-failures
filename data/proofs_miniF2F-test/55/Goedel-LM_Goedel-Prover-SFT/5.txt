  We aim to show that for all natural numbers \( n \), the sum of the cubes of the first \( n \) natural numbers is equal to the square of the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers. Formally, we need to prove that:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k^3 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2
  \]
  We will use mathematical induction to prove this statement.
  **Base Case:**
  For \( n = 0 \), the sum of the cubes of the first \( 0 \) natural numbers is \( 0 \), and the sum of the first \( 0 \) natural numbers is also \( 0 \). Therefore, the base case holds.
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n \), i.e.,
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k^3 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2
  \]
  We need to show that it holds for \( n+1 \):
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{n} k^3 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n} k \right)^2
  \]
  The sum of the cubes of the first \( n+1 \) natural numbers can be written as:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{n} k^3 = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k^3 + n^3
  \]
  By the inductive hypothesis, this is equal to:
  \[
  \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2 + n^3
  \]
  We need to show that this is equal to \( \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n} k \right)^2 \). Let \( \sum_{k=0}^{n} k = x \). Then:
  \[
  \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n} k \right)^2 = x^2
  \]
  We need to show that:
  \[
  x^2 + n^3 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k + n \right)^2
  \]
  Expanding the right-hand side:
  \[
  \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k + n \right)^2 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2 + 2 \cdot \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \cdot n + n^2
  \]
  By the inductive hypothesis, \( \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2 = x^2 \), so:
  \[
  x^2 + 2 \cdot \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \cdot n + n^2 = x^2 + 2 \cdot x \cdot n + n^2
  \]
  Since \( x = \sum_{k=0}^{n} k \), we have:
  \[
  x^2 + 2 \cdot x \cdot n + n^2 = x^2 + 2 \cdot x \cdot n + n^2
  \]
  Thus, the inductive step holds, completing the proof.
