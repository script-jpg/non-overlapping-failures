  We aim to prove that for all natural numbers \( n \), the sum of the cubes of the first \( n \) natural numbers is equal to the square of the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers. That is, we need to show:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k^3 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2
  \]
  We will use mathematical induction to prove this statement.
  **Base Case:**
  When \( n = 0 \), the left-hand side is:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{-1} k^3 = 0^3 = 0
  \]
  And the right-hand side is:
  \[
  \left( \sum_{k=0}^{-1} k \right)^2 = 0^2 = 0
  \]
  Thus, the base case holds.
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n = m \), i.e.,
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} k^3 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} k \right)^2
  \]
  We need to show it holds for \( n = m + 1 \).
  Consider the sum of cubes up to \( m + 1 \):
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{m} k^3 = \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} k^3 + m^3
  \]
  By the inductive hypothesis, this equals:
  \[
  \left( \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} k \right)^2 + m^3
  \]
  We need to show this equals \( \left( \sum_{k=0}^{m} k \right)^2 \).
  First, compute \( \sum_{k=0}^{m} k \):
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{m} k = \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} k + m
  \]
  Thus,
  \[
  \left( \sum_{k=0}^{m} k \right)^2 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} k + m \right)^2
  \]
  Expanding the right-hand side:
  \[
  \left( \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} k + m \right)^2 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} k \right)^2 + 2 \left( \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} k \right) m + m^2
  \]
  By the inductive hypothesis, this equals:
  \[
  \left( \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} k \right)^2 + m^3 + 2 \left( \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} k \right) m
  \]
  Simplifying, we see that:
  \[
  \left( \sum_{k=0}^{m} k \right)^2 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} k \right)^2 + m^3 + 2 \left( \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} k \right) m
  \]
  Thus, the inductive step holds, completing the proof.
