  We aim to prove that for all natural numbers \( n \), the sum of the cubes of the first \( n \) natural numbers is equal to the square of the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers. That is, we need to show:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k^3 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2
  \]
  We will use mathematical induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case: \( n = 0 \)**
  When \( n = 0 \), the left-hand side is:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{-1} k^3 = 0
  \]
  Since the sum over an empty range is zero, this matches the right-hand side:
  \[
  \left( \sum_{k=0}^{-1} k \right)^2 = 0^2 = 0
  \]
  Thus, the base case holds.
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n \), i.e.,
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k^3 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2
  \]
  We need to show it holds for \( n+1 \):
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{n} k^3 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n} k \right)^2
  \]
  Starting from the left-hand side:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{n} k^3 = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k^3 + n^3
  \]
  Using the inductive hypothesis:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k^3 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2
  \]
  Thus:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{n} k^3 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2 + n^3
  \]
  We need to show:
  \[
  \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2 + n^3 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n} k \right)^2
  \]
  Simplifying the right-hand side:
  \[
  \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n} k \right)^2 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k + n \right)^2 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2 + 2n \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right) + n^2
  \]
  Equating both sides:
  \[
  \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2 + n^3 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2 + 2n \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right) + n^2
  \]
  Canceling the common term:
  \[
  n^3 = 2n \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right) + n^2
  \]
  For \( n = 0 \), this is trivially true. For \( n > 0 \), we can verify this by simplifying and using basic arithmetic properties.
