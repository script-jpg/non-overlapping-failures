  We aim to show that for all natural numbers \( n \), the sum of the cubes of the first \( n \) natural numbers is equal to the square of the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers. Formally, we need to prove that:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k^3 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2
  \]
  We will use mathematical induction to prove this statement.
  **Base Case:**
  For \( n = 0 \), the left-hand side is:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{-1} k^3 = 0
  \]
  and the right-hand side is:
  \[
  \left( \sum_{k=0}^{-1} k \right)^2 = 0^2 = 0
  \]
  Thus, the base case holds.
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n \), i.e.,
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k^3 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2
  \]
  We need to show it holds for \( n + 1 \).
  Consider the sum of cubes up to \( n + 1 \):
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{n} k^3 = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k^3 + n^3
  \]
  By the inductive hypothesis, this is equal to:
  \[
  \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2 + n^3
  \]
  We need to show this equals \( \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n} k \right)^2 \).
  First, compute the sum of the first \( n + 1 \) natural numbers:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{n} k = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k + n
  \]
  Thus,
  \[
  \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n} k \right)^2 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k + n \right)^2
  \]
  Expanding the right-hand side:
  \[
  \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k + n \right)^2 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2 + 2 \cdot \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \cdot n + n^2
  \]
  By the inductive hypothesis, this equals:
  \[
  \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2 + n^3 + n^2
  \]
  Simplifying, we get:
  \[
  \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2 + n^3 + n^2 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2 + n^3
  \]
  Thus, the inductive step holds, completing the proof.
