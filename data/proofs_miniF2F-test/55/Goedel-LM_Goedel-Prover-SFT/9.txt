  We aim to show that for all natural numbers \( n \), the sum of the cubes of the first \( n \) natural numbers is equal to the square of the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers. That is, we need to prove:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k^3 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2
  \]
  We will use mathematical induction to establish this result.
  **Base Case:**
  For \( n = 0 \), the left-hand side is:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{-1} k^3 = 0
  \]
  and the right-hand side is:
  \[
  \left( \sum_{k=0}^{-1} k \right)^2 = 0^2 = 0
  \]
  Thus, the base case holds.
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n \), i.e.,
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k^3 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2
  \]
  We need to show it holds for \( n+1 \).
  Consider the sum of cubes up to \( n+1 \):
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{n} k^3 = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k^3 + n^3
  \]
  By the inductive hypothesis, this is equal to:
  \[
  \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2 + n^3
  \]
  We need to show this is equal to:
  \[
  \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n} k \right)^2
  \]
  The sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers is:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{n} k = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k + n
  \]
  Thus, the right-hand side becomes:
  \[
  \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k + n \right)^2 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2 + 2 \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \cdot n + n^2
  \]
  By the inductive hypothesis, this is equal to:
  \[
  \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2 + 2 \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \cdot n + n^2
  \]
  Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:
  \[
  \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2 + n^2 + 2 \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \cdot n
  \]
  This matches the left-hand side, confirming the inductive step.
  By induction, the statement holds for all natural numbers \( n \).
