  We aim to show that for all natural numbers \( n \), the sum of the cubes of the first \( n \) natural numbers is equal to the square of the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers. That is, we need to prove that:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k^3 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2
  \]
  We will use mathematical induction to establish this result.
  **Base Case:**
  For \( n = 0 \), the left-hand side is:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{-1} k^3 = 0
  \]
  and the right-hand side is:
  \[
  \left( \sum_{k=0}^{-1} k \right)^2 = 0^2 = 0
  \]
  Thus, the base case holds.
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some natural number \( n \), i.e.,
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k^3 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2
  \]
  We need to show that it holds for \( n+1 \).
  Consider the sum of cubes up to \( n+1 \):
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{n} k^3 = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k^3 + n^3
  \]
  By the inductive hypothesis, this is equal to:
  \[
  \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2 + n^3
  \]
  We need to show that this is equal to:
  \[
  \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n} k \right)^2
  \]
  Let \( s = \sum_{k=0}^{n} k \). Then:
  \[
  \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n} k \right)^2 = s^2
  \]
  and
  \[
  \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2 + n^3 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2 + n^3
  \]
  By the inductive hypothesis, we know:
  \[
  \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2 = s^2 - n^3
  \]
  Thus:
  \[
  \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n} k \right)^2 = s^2 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2 + n^3
  \]
  This completes the inductive step, proving the statement for all natural numbers \( n \).
