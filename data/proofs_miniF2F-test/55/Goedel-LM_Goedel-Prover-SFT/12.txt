  We aim to show that for all natural numbers \( n \), the sum of the cubes of the first \( n \) natural numbers is equal to the square of the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers. That is, we need to prove that:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k^3 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2
  \]
  We will use mathematical induction to establish this result.
  **Base Case:**
  When \( n = 0 \), the left-hand side is the sum of the cubes of the first \( 0 \) natural numbers, which is \( 0 \). The right-hand side is the square of the sum of the first \( 0 \) natural numbers, which is also \( 0 \). Thus, the base case holds.
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some natural number \( n \), i.e.,
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k^3 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2
  \]
  We need to show that the statement holds for \( n+1 \):
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{n} k^3 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n} k \right)^2
  \]
  Starting from the left-hand side:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{n} k^3 = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k^3 + n^3
  \]
  By the inductive hypothesis:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k^3 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2
  \]
  Thus:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{n} k^3 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2 + n^3
  \]
  We need to show that:
  \[
  \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2 + n^3 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n} k \right)^2
  \]
  Expanding the right-hand side:
  \[
  \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n} k \right)^2 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k + n \right)^2 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2 + 2 \cdot \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \cdot n + n^2
  \]
  By the inductive hypothesis:
  \[
  \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2 = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k^3
  \]
  Thus:
  \[
  \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n} k \right)^2 = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k^3 + 2 \cdot \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \cdot n + n^2
  \]
  Since \( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \cdot n = n \cdot \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \), we have:
  \[
  \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n} k \right)^2 = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k^3 + 2 \cdot n \cdot \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k + n^2
  \]
  Therefore:
  \[
  \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k \right)^2 + n^3 = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} k^3 + n^3 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{n} k \right)^2
  \]
  This completes the inductive step, proving the statement for all natural numbers \( n \).
