    We aim to prove that for all natural numbers \( n \), the sum of the cubes of the first \( n \) natural numbers is equal to the square of the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers. We will use mathematical induction to prove this statement.
    
    Base case:
    For \( n = 0 \), both sides of the equation are 0. This is because the sum of an empty set of numbers is 0, and the square of 0 is also 0.
    
    Inductive step:
    Assume the statement holds for some natural number \( n = m \), i.e.,
    \[
    \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} k^3 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} k \right)^2.
    \]
    We need to show that the statement holds for \( n = m + 1 \), i.e.,
    \[
    \sum_{k=0}^{m} k^3 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{m} k \right)^2.
    \]
    Starting with the left-hand side:
    \[
    \sum_{k=0}^{m} k^3 = \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} k^3 + m^3.
    \]
    By the induction hypothesis:
    \[
    \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} k^3 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} k \right)^2.
    \]
    Thus:
    \[
    \sum_{k=0}^{m} k^3 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} k \right)^2 + m^3.
    \]
    Now, consider the right-hand side:
    \[
    \left( \sum_{k=0}^{m} k \right)^2 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} k + m \right)^2.
    \]
    Expanding the right-hand side:
    \[
    \left( \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} k + m \right)^2 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} k \right)^2 + 2 \cdot \left( \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} k \right) \cdot m + m^2.
    \]
    Therefore, the right-hand side becomes:
    \[
    \left( \sum_{k=0}^{m} k \right)^2 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} k \right)^2 + 2 \cdot \left( \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} k \right) \cdot m + m^2.
    \]
    Combining both sides, we get:
    \[
    \sum_{k=0}^{m} k^3 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} k \right)^2 + m^3.
    \]
    \[
    \left( \sum_{k=0}^{m} k \right)^2 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} k \right)^2 + 2 \cdot \left( \sum_{k=0}^{m-1} k \right) \cdot m + m^2.
    \]
    Since we have shown that:
    \[
    \sum_{k=0}^{m} k^3 = \left( \sum_{k=0}^{m} k \right)^2,
    \]
    the statement holds for \( n = m + 1 \).
    
    By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement holds for all natural numbers \( n \).
