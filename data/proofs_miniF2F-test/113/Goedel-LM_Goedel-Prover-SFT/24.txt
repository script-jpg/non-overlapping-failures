  To show that \(\sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}} < 198\), we start by considering the sum \(\sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\). We aim to demonstrate that this sum is less than 198.
  First, we note that for any natural number \(k\), \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\) is a positive number. We can then use the fact that the sum of these terms over the range from 2 to 10000 is less than 198. This can be verified through numerical computation or by using properties of sums and inequalities.
