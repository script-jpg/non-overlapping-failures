  To show that the sum \(\sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}} < 198\), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Normalization and Simplification**: We start by normalizing the numerical values and simplifying the expression.
  2. **Summation and Inequality**: We use the properties of summation and inequalities to bound the sum from above.
  3. **Numerical Verification**: Finally, we verify the numerical bound to confirm the inequality.
