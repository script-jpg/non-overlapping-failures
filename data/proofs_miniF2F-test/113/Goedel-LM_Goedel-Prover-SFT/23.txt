  To show that \(\sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}} < 198\), we start by considering the sum \(\sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\). We aim to prove that this sum is less than 198. 
  First, we normalize the numerical expression to prepare for the comparison. We then use the fact that the square root of \(k\) is positive for all \(k \geq 2\) to establish a lower bound for the sum. Finally, we apply numerical and algebraic simplification to confirm the inequality.
