  To show that \(\sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}} < 198\), we can use the fact that the series \(\sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\) is a telescoping series. Each term \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\) can be rewritten as \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{k}}{\sqrt{k}} = \frac{\sqrt{k}}{k}\). The series then becomes:
  \[
  \sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{\sqrt{k}}{k}
  \]
  This series is a telescoping series, where most terms cancel out. Specifically, the sum can be written as:
  \[
  \sum_{k=2}^{10000} \left( \frac{\sqrt{k}}{k} - \frac{\sqrt{k-1}}{k-1} \right)
  \]
  After cancellation, we are left with:
  \[
  \frac{\sqrt{10000}}{10000} - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{100}{10000} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{100} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
  \]
  We need to show that this sum is less than 198. By simplifying the expression, we can see that:
  \[
  \frac{1}{100} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} < 198
  \]
