  To show that the sum \(\sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}} < 198\), we start by considering the series \(\sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\). We need to demonstrate that this series is less than 198.

  -- We need to show that the sum of the series is less than 198.
  -- We will use the fact that the series converges to a value less than 198.

  -- This line simplifies the sum by considering the range of indices from 2 to 10000.
  -- The `norm_num` tactic is used to verify that the simplified sum is indeed less than 198.
