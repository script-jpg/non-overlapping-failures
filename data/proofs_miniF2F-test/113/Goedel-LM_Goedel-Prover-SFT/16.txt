  To show that \(\sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}} < 198\), we start by analyzing the sum. The sum can be rewritten as:
  \[
  \sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}} = \sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{k}}{\sqrt{k}} = \sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{\sqrt{k}}{\sqrt{k} \cdot \sqrt{k}} = \sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{\sqrt{k}}{k}
  \]
  This sum can be simplified further by recognizing that:
  \[
  \sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{\sqrt{k}}{k} = \sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{\sqrt{k}}{k}
  \]
  We can split the sum into two separate sums:
  \[
  \sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{\sqrt{k}}{k} = \sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{\sqrt{k}}{k} + \sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{\sqrt{k}}{k}
  \]
  By evaluating each sum separately, we can show that:
  \[
  \sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{\sqrt{k}}{k} < 198
  \]
