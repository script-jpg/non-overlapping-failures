  To show that \(\sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}} < 198\), we start by considering the sum \(\sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\). We aim to demonstrate that this sum is less than 198.
  1. **Sum Representation**: The sum \(\sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\) can be represented as a sum over a finite set.
  2. **Bounding the Sum**: We aim to show that this sum is less than 198 by using properties of finite sums and inequalities.
  3. **Simplification and Numerical Bound**:
     - We use the fact that \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\) is a decreasing function of \(k\).
     - By applying numerical and algebraic bounds, we can establish that the sum is less than 198.
