  To show that \(\sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}} < 198\), we start by analyzing the sum. The sum \(\sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\) can be split into two separate sums: \(\sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\) and \(\sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\). We then compare these sums to 198.
