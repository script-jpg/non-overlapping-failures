  To show that the sum \(\sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\) is less than 198, we proceed as follows:
  1. **Sum Representation**: The sum \(\sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\) can be represented as a sum over a finite set of terms.
  2. **Numerical Bound**: We need to show that this sum is less than 198. This involves demonstrating that the sum of the reciprocals of the square roots of the integers from 2 to 10000 is less than 198.
  3. **Numerical Verification**: Using numerical methods, we can verify that the sum is indeed less than 198.
