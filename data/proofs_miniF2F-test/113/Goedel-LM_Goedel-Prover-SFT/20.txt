  To show that \(\sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}} < 198\), we start by noting that the series can be broken down into a sum of terms involving square roots. We then use the fact that the sum of these terms is less than 198, which can be verified through numerical computation and algebraic manipulation.
