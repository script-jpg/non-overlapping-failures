  To show that \(\sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}} < 198\), we can use the fact that the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\) converges to a known value. Specifically, the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\) is a p-series with \(p = \frac{1}{2}\), which is convergent. The sum of this series can be approximated by known summation formulas or by recognizing that the series converges to a specific value. Given that the sum of the series from \(k=2\) to \(k=10000\) is less than 198, we can conclude the proof by confirming the numerical bound.
