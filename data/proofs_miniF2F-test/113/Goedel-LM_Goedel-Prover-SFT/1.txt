  To show that \(\sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}} < 198\), we start by considering the sum \(\sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\). We can rewrite this sum as \(\sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\). We will use the fact that the series converges to a value less than 198. Specifically, we will show that the sum of the reciprocals of the square roots of the integers from 2 to 10000 is less than 198 by using basic properties of series and the fact that the terms decrease rapidly as \(k\) increases.
