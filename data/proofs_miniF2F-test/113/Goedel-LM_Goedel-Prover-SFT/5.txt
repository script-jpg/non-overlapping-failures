  To show that \(\sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}} < 198\), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Rewrite the sum**: Recognize that the sum \(\sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\) can be expressed in a more manageable form.
  2. **Apply numerical bound**: Use known numerical bounds or properties of series to establish the inequality.
