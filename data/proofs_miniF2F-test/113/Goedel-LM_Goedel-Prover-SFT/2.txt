  To show that \(\sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}} < 198\), we start by considering the sum \(\sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\). We can rewrite this sum as:
  \[
  \sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}} = \sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{k}}{\sqrt{k}} = \sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{\sqrt{k}}{k}
  \]
  Next, we use the fact that \(\sqrt{k}\) grows slower than \(k\) as \(k\) increases. Therefore, the sum \(\sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{\sqrt{k}}{k}\) is less than the sum \(\sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{k}\).
  We know that:
  \[
  \sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{k} = \ln 10000 - \ln 2
  \]
  Since \(\ln 10000 \approx 4.644\) and \(\ln 2 \approx 0.693\), we have:
  \[
  \sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{k} \approx 4.644 - 0.693 = 3.951
  \]
  Thus, we have:
  \[
  \sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{\sqrt{k}}{k} < 3.951
  \]
  Since \(3.951 < 198\), it follows that:
  \[
  \sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}} < 198
  \]
