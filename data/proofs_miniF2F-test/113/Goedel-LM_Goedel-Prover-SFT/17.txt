  To show that the sum \(\sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}} < 198\), we start by noting that the series is a sum of reciprocals of square roots. We can use the fact that the sum of the first \(n\) terms of a geometric series can be expressed in a closed form. Specifically, we can rewrite the sum as a telescoping series, where most terms cancel out. This allows us to simplify the expression and compare it to known values.
