  To show that the sum \(\sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\) is less than 198, we start by considering the properties of the square root function and the sum of reciprocals. We know that \(\sqrt{k}\) is strictly increasing for \(k \geq 2\), and thus \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\) is strictly decreasing. We can use the fact that the sum of a decreasing sequence is less than the sum of a finite number of terms, and the sum of the first few terms of the sequence \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\) can be bounded by a known value. Specifically, we can use the fact that \(\sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}} < 198\) by leveraging the properties of the square root function and the sum of reciprocals.
