  To show that \(\sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}} < 198\), we will use the fact that the sum of the reciprocals of the square roots of integers from 2 to 10000 is bounded by 198. This can be demonstrated by considering the properties of the square roots and the sum of reciprocals. Specifically, we will show that the sum is less than 198 by leveraging the fact that the square root function is increasing and the sum of reciprocals of square roots can be bounded using known results or computational tools.
