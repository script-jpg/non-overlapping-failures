  To show that \(\sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}} < 198\), we start by considering the sum \(\sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\). We need to demonstrate that this sum is less than 198.
  First, we use the fact that the square root function is increasing and positive for \(k \geq 2\). We then simplify the sum by using properties of finite sums and the fact that the sum of reciprocals of square roots can be bounded using known series properties.
