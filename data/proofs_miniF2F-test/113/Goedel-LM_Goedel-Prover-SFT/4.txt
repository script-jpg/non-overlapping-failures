  To show that the sum \(\sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}} < 198\), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Normalization and Simplification**: We start by normalizing the numerical constants and simplifying the expression.
  2. **Summation Analysis**: We analyze the sum \(\sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\) by considering the properties of the square root function and the range of summation.
  3. **Numerical Verification**: We use numerical methods to verify the inequality.
