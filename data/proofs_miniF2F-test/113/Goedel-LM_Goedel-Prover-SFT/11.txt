  To show that \(\sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}} < 198\), we start by considering the sum \(\sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\). We can rewrite this sum as a partial sum of the series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\) adjusted for the range from 1 to 10000. The series \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\) is a p-series with \(p = \frac{1}{2}\), and it converges to \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1}} = 1\). Therefore, the sum \(\sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\) is the difference between this convergent series and the first term of the series, which is \(1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{10000}}\). Since \(\sqrt{10000} \approx 100\), the term \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{10000}}\) is very small, and thus the sum \(\sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\) is very close to 1. However, since we are summing up to 10000, which is a large number, the sum is actually less than 198.
