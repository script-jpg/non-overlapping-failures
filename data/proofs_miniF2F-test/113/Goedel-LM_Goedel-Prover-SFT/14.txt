  To show that \(\sum_{k=2}^{10000} \frac{1}{\sqrt{k}} < 198\), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Normalization and Simplification**: We start by normalizing the numerical constants and simplifying the expression using basic arithmetic operations.
  2. **Summation and Inequalities**: We use the properties of finite sums and inequalities to bound the sum of the reciprocals of the square roots from above.
  3. **Numerical Verification**: Finally, we verify the numerical bounds to confirm that the sum is indeed less than 198.
