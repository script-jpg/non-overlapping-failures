-- Note on the formalization of the problem:
  -- We need to show that the sum of 1/√k from k=2 to k=10000 is less than 198.

  -- The key idea is to use an integral approximation. For large N, the sum ∑_{k=2}^N 1/√k
  -- is approximately equal to the integral ∫_{2}^N 1/√x dx.
  -- We have ∫ 1/√x dx = 2√x + C, so ∫_{2}^N 1/√x dx = 2√N - 2√2.
  -- Thus, for large N, ∑_{k=2}^N 1/√k ≈ 2√N - 2√2.

  -- Let's proceed with the formal proof:

  -- We will use the fact that for any a < b, ∑_{k=a}^b 1/√k < ∫_{a-1}^b 1/√x dx.
  -- This is because the sum is a lower Riemann sum for the integral ∫_{a-1}^b 1/√x dx.
  -- So it is sufficient to show that ∫_{198}^10000 1/√x dx > ∑_{k=2}^10000 1/√k.
  -- Using our approximation, this becomes 2√10000 - 2√198 > 2√2 - ∑_{k=2}^10000 1/√k.
  -- Simplifying, 200 - 2√198 > 2√2 - ∑_{k=2}^10000 1/√k.
  -- Further, 100 - √198 > √2 - ∑_{k=2}^10000 1/√k.
  -- Thus, it is sufficient to show that 100 - √198 > √2, or equivalently, 100 > √198 + √2.

  -- In the formal proof, we will use a similar approach but more directly:
  -- We will show that the sum is less than 198 by comparing it to a constant function.
  -- Consider the set {2, 3,..., 10000} and compare the sum to ∑_{k=2}^10000 1/√2.
  -- Since √k is increasing, 1/√k is decreasing, so 1/√k ≤ 1/√2 for all k ≥ 2.
  -- Thus, ∑_{k=2}^10000 1/√k ≤ ∑_{k=2}^10000 1/√2 = 9999/√2 < 198.

  -- The sum ∑_{k=2}^10000 1/√k is less than ∑_{k=2}^10000 1/√2 because 1/√k is decreasing.
