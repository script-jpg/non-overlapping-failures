  To show that for any three positive real numbers \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \), \( \frac{9}{x + y + z} \leq \frac{2}{x + y} + \frac{2}{y + z} + \frac{2}{z + x} \), we start by ensuring that all terms involved are positive. We then simplify the inequality by clearing denominators and rearranging terms. Finally, we use algebraic manipulation and the non-negativity of squares to establish the inequality.
