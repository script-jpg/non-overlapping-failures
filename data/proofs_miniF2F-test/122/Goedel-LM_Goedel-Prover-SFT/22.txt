  We need to show that for any three positive real numbers \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \), the inequality \( \frac{9}{x + y + z} \leq \frac{2}{x + y} + \frac{2}{y + z} + \frac{2}{z + x} \) holds.
  First, we establish that the denominators are positive:
  - \( x + y > 0 \) because \( x > 0 \) and \( y > 0 \).
  - \( y + z > 0 \) because \( y > 0 \) and \( z > 0 \).
  - \( z + x > 0 \) because \( z > 0 \) and \( x > 0 \).
  Next, we simplify the inequality by clearing the denominators using the fact that \( x + y + z > 0 \). This allows us to rewrite the inequality in a form that can be handled by algebraic manipulation and linear arithmetic.
  Finally, we use linear arithmetic to verify the inequality.
