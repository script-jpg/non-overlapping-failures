  We need to show that for any three positive real numbers \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \), the inequality \( \frac{9}{x + y + z} \leq \frac{2}{x + y} + \frac{2}{y + z} + \frac{2}{z + x} \) holds.
  1. First, we establish that the denominators are positive:
     - \( x + y + z > 0 \) because \( x > 0 \), \( y > 0 \), and \( z > 0 \).
     - \( x + y > 0 \) because \( x > 0 \) and \( y > 0 \).
     - \( y + z > 0 \) because \( y > 0 \) and \( z > 0 \).
     - \( z + x > 0 \) because \( z > 0 \) and \( x > 0 \).
  2. We then simplify the inequality by clearing the denominators using the fact that \( x + y + z > 0 \), \( x + y > 0 \), \( y + z > 0 \), and \( z + x > 0 \).
  3. Finally, we use algebraic manipulation and the non-negativity of squares to show that the inequality holds.
