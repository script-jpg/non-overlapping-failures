  To show that for any three positive real numbers \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \), \( \frac{9}{x+y+z} \leq \frac{2}{x+y} + \frac{2}{y+z} + \frac{2}{z+x} \), we start by ensuring that all denominators are positive. We then simplify the inequality by clearing the denominators and rearranging terms. Finally, we use algebraic manipulation and non-negativity properties to establish the inequality.
