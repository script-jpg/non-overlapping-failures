  To show that for any three positive real numbers \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \), the inequality \( \frac{9}{x+y+z} \leq \frac{2}{x+y} + \frac{2}{y+z} + \frac{2}{z+x} \) holds, we proceed as follows:
  1. **Establish the positivity of the denominators**: Since \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) are positive, the sums \( x + y \), \( y + z \), and \( z + x \) are also positive.
  2. **Simplify the fractions**: Clear the denominators by multiplying both sides of the inequality by \( (x+y)(y+z)(z+x) \).
  3. **Expand and simplify**: Use algebraic manipulation to expand and simplify the resulting expressions.
  4. **Apply non-negativity of squares**: Use the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative to establish the inequality.
