  We need to show that for any three positive real numbers \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \), the inequality \( \frac{9}{x + y + z} \leq \frac{2}{x + y} + \frac{2}{y + z} + \frac{2}{z + x} \) holds.
  First, we establish that all denominators are positive:
  - \( x + y + z \) is positive because \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) are positive.
  - \( x + y \) is positive because \( x \) and \( y \) are positive.
  - \( y + z \) is positive because \( y \) and \( z \) are positive.
  - \( z + x \) is positive because \( z \) and \( x \) are positive.
  Next, we simplify the inequality by clearing the denominators using the fact that all denominators are positive. This allows us to rewrite the inequality in a form that can be handled by basic algebraic manipulations and inequalities.
  Finally, we use basic algebraic manipulations and inequalities to show that the left-hand side of the inequality is less than or equal to the right-hand side. This is done using the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative, which helps in proving the inequality.
