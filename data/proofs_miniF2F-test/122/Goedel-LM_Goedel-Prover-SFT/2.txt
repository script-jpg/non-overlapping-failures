  To show that for any three positive real numbers \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \), \( \frac{9}{x + y + z} \leq \frac{2}{x + y} + \frac{2}{y + z} + \frac{2}{z + x} \), we start by ensuring that all terms involved are positive. We then simplify the inequality using algebraic manipulations and apply basic arithmetic and linear inequalities to establish the result.

  have h₆ : 0 < y * z := by nlinarith
  have h₇ : 0 < z * x := by nlinarith
