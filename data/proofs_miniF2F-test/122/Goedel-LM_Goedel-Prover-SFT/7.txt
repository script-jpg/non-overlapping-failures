  To show that for any three positive real numbers \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \), \( \frac{9}{x + y + z} \leq \frac{2}{x + y} + \frac{2}{y + z} + \frac{2}{z + x} \), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Establish the positivity of the denominators**: Since \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) are positive, the sums \( x + y \), \( y + z \), and \( z + x \) are all positive.
  2. **Simplify the inequality**: Clear the denominators by multiplying both sides of the inequality by the common denominator \( (x + y + z)(x + y)(y + z)(z + x) \).
  3. **Expand and simplify**: Use algebraic manipulation to expand and simplify the resulting expressions.
  4. **Apply the non-negativity of squares**: Use the fact that the squares of real numbers are non-negative to conclude the inequality.
