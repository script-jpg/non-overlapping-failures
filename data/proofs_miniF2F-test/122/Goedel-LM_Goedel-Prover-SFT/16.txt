  We need to show that for any three positive real numbers \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \), the inequality \( \frac{9}{x + y + z} \leq \frac{2}{x + y} + \frac{2}{y + z} + \frac{2}{z + x} \) holds. To do this, we first establish that the denominators are positive. Then, we use the fact that the denominators are positive to clear the denominators by multiplying both sides of the inequality by the common denominator. Finally, we simplify and verify the inequality using algebraic manipulations.
