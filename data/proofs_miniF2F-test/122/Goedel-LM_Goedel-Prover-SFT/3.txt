  To prove the inequality \( \frac{9}{x + y + z} \leq \frac{2}{x + y} + \frac{2}{y + z} + \frac{2}{z + x} \) for any positive real numbers \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \), we start by noting that since \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) are positive, the denominators \( x + y \), \( y + z \), and \( z + x \) are all positive. We then simplify the inequality by clearing the denominators using the fact that these denominators are positive. This allows us to rewrite the inequality in a form that can be handled by basic algebraic manipulations and inequalities. Specifically, we use the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative, which helps in proving the inequality through algebraic manipulation.
