  We need to show that for any three positive real numbers \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \), the inequality \( \frac{9}{x + y + z} \leq \frac{2}{x + y} + \frac{2}{y + z} + \frac{2}{z + x} \) holds.
  To prove this, we start by noting that since \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) are positive, the denominators \( x + y + z \), \( x + y \), \( y + z \), and \( z + x \) are all positive. We then simplify the inequality by clearing the denominators using the fact that \( x + y + z \), \( x + y \), \( y + z \), and \( z + x \) are positive. This allows us to rewrite the inequality in a form that can be handled by basic algebraic manipulations and inequalities.
  Next, we use the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative to derive the desired inequality. Specifically, we consider the squares of the differences \( (x + y + z) \), \( (x - y) \), \( (y - z) \), \( (z - x) \), \( (x + y - z) \), \( (y + z - x) \), \( (z + x - y) \), and \( (x + y + z - 0) \). By ensuring that these squares are non-negative, we can establish the desired inequality.
