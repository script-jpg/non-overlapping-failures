  To prove the inequality \( \frac{9}{x+y+z} \leq \frac{2}{x+y} + \frac{2}{y+z} + \frac{2}{z+x} \) for any positive real numbers \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \), we start by ensuring that all denominators are positive. We then clear the denominators by multiplying both sides by \( (x+y)(y+z)(z+x) \). This step simplifies the inequality to a polynomial inequality. We then expand and simplify the resulting polynomial, leading to a comparison of terms that can be handled using basic algebraic manipulations and inequalities. Finally, we use the non-negativity of squares to conclude the proof.
