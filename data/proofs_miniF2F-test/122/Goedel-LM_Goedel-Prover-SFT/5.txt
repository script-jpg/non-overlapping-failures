  To show that for any three positive real numbers \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \), \( \frac{9}{x+y+z} \leq \frac{2}{x+y} + \frac{2}{y+z} + \frac{2}{z+x} \), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Establish the positivity of the denominators**: Since \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) are positive, we have \( 0 < x + y + z \), \( 0 < x + y \), \( 0 < y + z \), and \( 0 < z + x \).
  2. **Simplify the inequality**: Clear the denominators by multiplying both sides of the inequality by \( (x + y) \cdot (y + z) \cdot (z + x) \).
  3. **Expand and simplify**: Use algebraic manipulation to expand and simplify the resulting expressions.
  4. **Apply non-negative arithmetic**: Use the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative to establish the inequality.
