  To show that for any three positive real numbers \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \), the inequality \( \frac{9}{x + y + z} \leq \frac{2}{x + y} + \frac{2}{y + z} + \frac{2}{z + x} \) holds, we proceed as follows:
  1. **Establish the positivity of the denominators**: Since \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) are positive, the sums \( x + y \), \( y + z \), and \( z + x \) are also positive.
  2. **Simplify the inequality**: Clear the denominators by multiplying both sides by the common denominator \((x + y) \cdot (y + z) \cdot (z + x)\).
  3. **Expand and simplify**: Expand the resulting expression and simplify using algebraic identities.
  4. **Apply non-negative arithmetic**: Use the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative to establish the inequality.
