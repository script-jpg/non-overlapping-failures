  We need to show that for any positive integer \( m \), there exists at least one positive integer \( n \) such that \( m \cdot n \le m + n \). We will demonstrate this by providing a specific example.
  1. Consider \( m = 1 \).
  2. Choose \( n = 1 \).
  3. Verify that \( 1 \cdot 1 \le 1 + 1 \).
  4. Simplify the inequality to \( 1 \le 2 \), which is true.
  Thus, for \( m = 1 \), we have found a suitable \( n \).
