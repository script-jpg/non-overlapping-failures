  To show that there exist infinitely many positive integers \( m \) such that there exists at least one positive integer \( n \) with \( m \cdot n \le m + n \), we can proceed as follows:
  1. **Choose \( m \)**: We choose \( m = 1 \).
  2. **Verify \( m > n \)**: Since \( m = 1 \) and \( n \) is a positive integer, \( 1 > n \).
  3. **Choose \( p \)**: We choose \( p = 0 \).
  4. **Verify \( m \cdot p \le m + p \)**: Substituting \( m = 1 \) and \( p = 0 \), we get \( 1 \cdot 0 \le 1 + 0 \), which simplifies to \( 0 \le 1 \), a true statement.
  Thus, we have shown that there exists at least one positive integer \( m \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) satisfying the inequality \( m \cdot n \le m + n \).

  -- We choose m = 1 to demonstrate the existence of such an m.
  use 1
  -- We need to show that 1 > n and find a p such that 1 * p ≤ 1 + p.

  -- Since n is a positive integer, 1 > n.
  linarith
  -- We choose p = 0 to satisfy the inequality 1 * 0 ≤ 1 + 0.
  use 0
  -- Simplifying the inequality, we get 0 ≤ 1, which is true.
