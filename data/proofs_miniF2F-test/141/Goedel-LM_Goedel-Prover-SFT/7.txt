  To show that there are infinitely many positive integers \( m \) such that there exists at least one positive integer \( n \) satisfying \( m \cdot n \le m + n \), we can proceed as follows:
  1. For any positive integer \( m \), we need to find a positive integer \( n \) such that \( m \cdot n \le m + n \).
  2. Consider \( n = m \). Then \( m \cdot m \le m + m \) simplifies to \( m^2 \le 2m \).
  3. For \( m > 0 \), \( m^2 \le 2m \) holds because \( m^2 - 2m \le 0 \) and \( m(m - 2) \le 0 \).
  4. Therefore, for any positive integer \( m \), the condition \( m \cdot n \le m + n \) is satisfied with \( n = m \).
  5. Since \( m \) can be arbitrarily large, we have shown that there are infinitely many such \( m \).

  -- For any positive integer n, we need to find a positive integer m such that m * n ≤ m + n.
  -- Consider m = n + 1. Then m * n ≤ m + n simplifies to n * (n + 1) ≤ 2n + 1.
  -- For n > 0, n * (n + 1) ≤ 2n + 1 holds because n^2 + n ≤ 2n + 1 and n^2 - n ≤ 0.
  -- Therefore, for any positive integer n, the condition m * n ≤ m + n is satisfied with m = n + 1.
  -- Since n can be arbitrarily large, we have shown that there are infinitely many such m.
