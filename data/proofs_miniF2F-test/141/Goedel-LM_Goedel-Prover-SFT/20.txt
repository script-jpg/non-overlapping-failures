  We need to show that there exists a positive integer \( m \) such that for any positive integer \( n \), there exists at least one positive integer \( p \) satisfying \( m \cdot p \leq m + p \). We will demonstrate that \( m = 0 \) satisfies this condition for any positive integer \( n \).
  1. Choose \( m = 0 \).
  2. Verify that \( 0 > n \) for any positive integer \( n \).
  3. Choose \( p = 0 \).
  4. Check that \( 0 \cdot 0 \leq 0 + 0 \), which simplifies to \( 0 \leq 0 \), a true statement.
  Thus, \( m = 0 \) satisfies the condition for any positive integer \( n \).
