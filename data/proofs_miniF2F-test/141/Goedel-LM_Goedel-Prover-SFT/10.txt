  We need to show that for any positive integer \( m \), there exists at least one positive integer \( n \) such that \( m \cdot n \leq m + n \). We will demonstrate this by providing a specific example for any given \( m \).
  1. Choose \( m = 1 \).
  2. For any \( n \), we can choose \( p = 0 \).
  3. Verify that \( m \cdot p = 1 \cdot 0 = 0 \leq 1 + 0 = m + p \).
  Thus, for any positive integer \( m \), there exists at least one positive integer \( n \) (specifically \( n = 0 \)) such that \( m \cdot n \leq m + n \).
