  To show that there are infinitely many positive integers \( m \) such that there exists at least one positive integer \( n \) for which \( m \cdot n \le m + n \), we can proceed as follows:
  1. Consider any positive integer \( m \).
  2. We need to find a positive integer \( n \) such that \( m \cdot n \le m + n \).
  3. Choose \( n = 1 \).
  4. Verify that \( m \cdot 1 \le m + 1 \) simplifies to \( m \le m + 1 \), which is always true for any positive integer \( m \).
  Thus, we have shown that there are infinitely many such \( m \).

  -- We choose m = n + 1, which is greater than n.
  use n + 1
  -- We need to show that m > n and there exists a p such that m * p ≤ m + p.
  constructor
  -- Since m = n + 1, it is clear that m > n.

  -- We choose p = 1.
  use 1
  -- Simplify the inequality m * 1 ≤ m + 1 to show it holds for any m.
