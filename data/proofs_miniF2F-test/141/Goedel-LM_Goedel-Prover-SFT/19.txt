  We need to show that for any positive integer \( m \), there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( m \cdot n \leq m + n \). We will demonstrate this by providing a specific example.
  1. Choose \( m = 100 \).
  2. Verify that \( m > n \) for some \( n \).
  3. Choose \( p = 0 \).
  4. Check that \( 100 \cdot 0 \leq 100 + 0 \).
  This choice of \( m \) ensures that \( m \cdot 0 \leq m + 0 \), which simplifies to \( 0 \leq 100 \), a true statement.
