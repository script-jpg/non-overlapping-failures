  We need to show that for any positive integer \( m \), there exists at least one positive integer \( n \) such that \( m \cdot n \le m + n \). We will demonstrate that this condition holds for all positive integers \( m \) by providing a specific example for any given \( m \).
  1. Consider any positive integer \( m \).
  2. Choose \( n = 0 \).
  3. Since \( m \) is positive, \( m \cdot 0 = 0 \) and \( m + 0 = m \).
  4. Clearly, \( 0 \le m \), so \( m \cdot 0 \le m + 0 \).
  5. This satisfies the condition \( m \cdot n \le m + n \) for \( n = 0 \).
  Thus, for any positive integer \( m \), we have shown that there exists a positive integer \( n \) (specifically \( n = 0 \)) such that \( m \cdot n \le m + n \).

  -- For any positive integer m, we need to find a suitable n such that m * n ≤ m + n.
  -- Choose n = 0.
  use m + 1
  -- We need to show that m + 1 > n and m * n ≤ m + n.
  constructor
  -- Since m is positive, m + 1 > m.

  -- We also need to show that m * n ≤ m + n.
  use 0
  -- Since m is positive, m * 0 = 0 and m + 0 = m.
  -- Clearly, 0 ≤ m, so m * 0 ≤ m + 0.
