  To show that there are infinitely many positive integers \( m \) such that there exists at least one positive integer \( n \) for which \( m \cdot n \le m + n \), we can proceed as follows:
  1. Consider the sequence of integers \( m = 1, 2, 3, \ldots \).
  2. For each \( m \), choose \( n = 1 \).
  3. Verify that \( m \cdot 1 \le m + 1 \) holds for all \( m \).
  4. Since \( m \cdot 1 = m \) and \( m + 1 \) is always greater than \( m \) for any positive \( m \), the inequality \( m \cdot 1 \le m + 1 \) is satisfied.
  5. Conclude that there are infinitely many such \( m \) because the sequence \( m = 1, 2, 3, \ldots \) includes all positive integers.

  -- Consider the sequence of integers m = 1, 2, 3,...
  use 2 * n + 1
  -- Show that 2 * n + 1 is greater than n
  have h₁ : 0 < 2 * n + 1 := by linarith
  -- Choose n = 1
  use h₁
  -- Verify that m * 1 ≤ m + 1 holds for all m
  have h₂ : 0 < n + 1 := by linarith
  use 1
  -- Simplify the inequality m * 1 ≤ m + 1
  simp [h₀, h₁, h₂]
