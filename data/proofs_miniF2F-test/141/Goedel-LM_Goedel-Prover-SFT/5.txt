  We need to show that for any positive integer \( m \), there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( m \cdot n \leq m + n \). We will demonstrate this by constructing a specific example for any given positive integer \( m \).
  1. Choose \( n = m + 1 \).
  2. Verify that \( n \) is indeed positive.
  3. Choose \( p = 0 \).
  4. Verify that \( m \cdot 0 \leq m + 0 \) holds true.

  -- Choose n = m + 1
  use m + 1
  -- Verify that n is positive and choose p = 0
