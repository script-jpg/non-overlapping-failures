  We need to show that for any positive integer \( m \), there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( m \cdot n \leq m + n \). We will prove this by constructing a specific example.
  1. Consider the integer \( m = 1 \).
  2. Choose \( n = 1 \).
  3. Verify that \( m > n \).
  4. Check that \( m \cdot n \leq m + n \).
