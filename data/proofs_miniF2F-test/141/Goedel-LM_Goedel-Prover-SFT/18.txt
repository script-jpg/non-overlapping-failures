  We need to show that for any positive integer \( m \), there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( m \cdot n \leq m + n \). We will demonstrate this by constructing a specific example where \( m = 1 \), \( n = 1 \), and showing that \( 1 \cdot 1 \leq 1 + 1 \).

  -- We choose m = 1, which is a positive integer.
  use 1
  -- We need to show that 1 > n (which is true since n is a positive integer).
  -- We also need to show that there exists a p such that 1 * p ≤ 1 + p.
  -- We choose p = 1, which is a positive integer.
