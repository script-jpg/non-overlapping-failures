  We need to show that for any positive integer \( m \), there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( m \cdot n \leq m + n \). We will demonstrate this by constructing a specific example.
  1. Choose \( m = 1 \).
  2. Verify that \( m = 1 \) is positive.
  3. Choose \( n = 1 \).
  4. Verify that \( n = 1 \) is positive.
  5. Check that \( 1 \cdot 1 \leq 1 + 1 \), which simplifies to \( 1 \leq 2 \), and this inequality holds true.
  Thus, we have shown that there exists a positive integer \( m \) and a positive integer \( n \) such that \( m \cdot n \leq m + n \).

  -- We will use m = 1 as our candidate for the positive integer.
  use 1,
    -- We need to show that 1 > n, which follows directly from the given condition h₀.
    one_pos.trans_le (by simp : 1 ≤ 1)
  -- Now, we need to find a positive integer p such that 1 * p ≤ 1 + p.
  use 1
  -- Simplifying, we see that 1 * 1 ≤ 1 + 1, which is true.
