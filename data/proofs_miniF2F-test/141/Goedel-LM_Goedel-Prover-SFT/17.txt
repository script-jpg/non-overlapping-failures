  We need to show that for any positive integer \( m \), there exists at least one positive integer \( n \) such that \( m \cdot n \leq m + n \). We will demonstrate this by considering the inequality \( m \cdot n \leq m + n \).
  1. Start by considering the inequality \( m \cdot n \leq m + n \).
  2. To find a suitable \( n \), we can choose \( n = m + 1 \).
  3. Substituting \( n = m + 1 \) into the inequality, we get:
     \[
     m \cdot (m + 1) \leq m + (m + 1)
     \]
  4. Simplifying the left-hand side, we have:
     \[
     m^2 + m \leq 2m + 1
     \]
  5. Rearranging terms, we get:
     \[
     m^2 + m - 2m - 1 \leq 0 \implies m^2 - m - 1 \leq 0
     \]
  6. This inequality can be verified by noting that \( m^2 - m - 1 \) is a quadratic expression that opens upwards and has roots at \( m = 1 \) and \( m = -1 \). Since \( m \) is a positive integer, the quadratic expression is always non-positive.
  7. Therefore, \( m = m + 1 \) satisfies the inequality \( m \cdot n \leq m + n \).

  -- Substituting n = m + 1 into the inequality, we get m * (m + 1) ≤ m + (m + 1).
  -- Simplifying, we have m^2 + m ≤ 2m + 1.
  -- Rearranging terms, we get m^2 - m - 1 ≤ 0.
  -- This inequality is verified by noting that m^2 - m - 1 is a quadratic expression that opens upwards and has roots at m = 1 and m = -1.
  -- Since m is a positive integer, the quadratic expression is always non-positive.
