  We need to show that for any positive integer \( m \), there exists at least one positive integer \( n \) such that \( m \cdot n \leq m + n \). We will demonstrate this by providing a specific example for any given \( m \).
  Consider \( m = 1 \). We can choose \( n = 1 \). Then, we have:
  \[ 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \leq 1 + 1 = 2 \]
  This satisfies the inequality \( m \cdot n \leq m + n \).

  -- Now, for m = 1, we choose n = 1.
  use 1 + m + 1
  -- We need to show that 1 + m + 1 > m and there exists a p such that (1 + m + 1) * p ≤ (1 + m + 1) + p.
