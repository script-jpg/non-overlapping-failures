  We need to show that for any positive integer \( m \), there exists at least one positive integer \( n \) such that \( m \cdot n \leq m + n \). We will prove this by constructing a specific example.
  1. Choose \( m = 3 \).
  2. We need to find \( n \) such that \( 3 \cdot n \leq 3 + n \).
  3. Let \( n = 3 \).
  4. Verify the inequality: \( 3 \cdot 3 = 9 \) and \( 3 + 3 = 6 \).
  5. Clearly, \( 9 \leq 6 \), which is false.
  6. Therefore, we need to choose a different \( n \).
  7. Let's choose \( n = 2 \).
  8. Verify the inequality: \( 3 \cdot 2 = 6 \) and \( 3 + 2 = 5 \).
  9. Clearly, \( 6 \leq 5 \), which is false.
  10. Therefore, we need to choose a different \( n \).
  11. Let's choose \( n = 1 \).
  12. Verify the inequality: \( 3 \cdot 1 = 3 \) and \( 3 + 1 = 4 \).
  13. Clearly, \( 3 \leq 4 \), which is true.
  14. Therefore, \( m = 3 \) and \( n = 1 \) satisfy the condition.
