  To show that there are infinitely many positive integers \( m \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) where \( m \cdot n \leq m + n \), we can proceed as follows:
  1. For any positive integer \( n \), we need to find a corresponding \( m \) such that \( m \cdot n \leq m + n \).
  2. Consider \( m = n + 1 \). We need to verify that \( (n + 1) \cdot n \leq (n + 1) + n \).
  3. Expanding both sides, we get \( n^2 + n \leq n + 1 + n \), which simplifies to \( n^2 + n \leq 2n + 1 \).
  4. This inequality holds because \( n^2 + n \leq 2n + 1 \) is equivalent to \( n^2 - n + 1 \leq 0 \), which is true for all positive integers \( n \).
  5. Therefore, for any positive integer \( n \), we have found a corresponding \( m = n + 1 \) that satisfies the inequality.
  6. Since there are infinitely many positive integers \( n \), there are also infinitely many such \( m \).

  -- For any positive integer n, we need to find a corresponding m such that m * n ≤ m + n.
  -- Consider m = n + 1. We need to verify that (n + 1) * n ≤ (n + 1) + n.
  -- Expanding both sides, we get n^2 + n ≤ n + 1 + n, which simplifies to n^2 + n ≤ 2n + 1.
  -- This inequality holds because n^2 + n ≤ 2n + 1 is equivalent to n^2 - n + 1 ≤ 0, which is true for all positive integers n.
  -- Therefore, for any positive integer n, we have found a corresponding m = n + 1 that satisfies the inequality.
  -- Since there are infinitely many positive integers n, there are also infinitely many such m.
