  We need to show that for any positive integer \( m \), there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( m \cdot n \leq m + n \). We will prove this by constructing a counterexample for each \( m \).
  1. **Case \( m = 1 \)**:
     - Choose \( n = 1 \).
     - Verify that \( 1 \cdot 1 \leq 1 + 1 \).
     - Simplify to get \( 1 \leq 2 \), which is true.
  2. **Case \( m = 2 \)**:
     - Choose \( n = 2 \).
     - Verify that \( 2 \cdot 2 \leq 2 + 2 \).
     - Simplify to get \( 4 \leq 4 \), which is true.
  3. **Case \( m = 3 \)**:
     - Choose \( n = 3 \).
     - Verify that \( 3 \cdot 3 \leq 3 + 3 \).
     - Simplify to get \( 9 \leq 6 \), which is false.
  Thus, we have shown that for \( m = 1 \) and \( m = 2 \), there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( m \cdot n \leq m + n \). For \( m = 3 \), we need to choose \( n \) such that \( 3 \cdot n \leq 3 + n \), which simplifies to \( 3n \leq 3 + n \), or \( 2n \leq 3 \), implying \( n \leq 1 \). However, \( n \) must be a positive integer, so this case does not provide a valid counterexample.

  -- For m = 3, we need to choose n such that 3 * n ≤ 3 + n, which simplifies to 3n ≤ 3 + n, or 2n ≤ 3, implying n ≤ 1
