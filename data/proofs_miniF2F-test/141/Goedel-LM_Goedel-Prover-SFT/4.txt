  To show that there are infinitely many positive integers \( m \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) satisfying \( m \cdot n \le m + n \), we can construct such an \( m \) for any given \( n \). Specifically, we choose \( m = n + 1 \). This choice ensures that \( m > n \) and there exists a \( p \) such that \( m \cdot p \le m + p \). In this case, we can choose \( p = 0 \), which satisfies the inequality since \( m \cdot 0 = 0 \le m + 0 = m \).

  -- We need to show that m * n ≤ m + n for m = n + 1.
  -- Choosing p = 0, we have m * 0 = 0 ≤ m + 0 = m.
