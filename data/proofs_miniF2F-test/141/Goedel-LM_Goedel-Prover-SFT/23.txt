  To show that there are infinitely many positive integers \( m \) such that there exists at least one positive integer \( n \) satisfying \( m \cdot n \le m + n \), we proceed as follows:
  1. Consider the set of all positive integers \( m \).
  2. For any \( m \), choose \( n = m \).
  3. Verify that \( m \cdot n \le m + n \) holds for \( n = m \).
  4. Since the inequality \( m \cdot m \le m + m \) simplifies to \( m^2 \le 2m \), which is true for all \( m \), we have found a solution.
  5. Therefore, there are infinitely many \( m \) such that \( m \cdot n \le m + n \) holds for some \( n \).

  -- We use the set of all positive integers m.
  use 1 + n
  -- We need to show that 1 + n is greater than n and there exists a p such that (1 + n) * p ≤ (1 + n) + p.

  -- Choose p = 0.
  use 0
  -- Simplify the inequality (1 + n) * 0 ≤ (1 + n) + 0.
