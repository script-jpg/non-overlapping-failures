  We need to show that for any positive integer \( m \), there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( m \cdot n \leq m + n \). We will demonstrate this by constructing a specific example for \( m = 1 \).
  1. Choose \( m = 1 \).
  2. Since \( 1 > 0 \), we have \( m > 0 \).
  3. Choose \( p = 0 \).
  4. Calculate \( 1 \cdot 0 = 0 \) and \( 1 + 0 = 1 \).
  5. Clearly, \( 0 \leq 1 \), so \( m \cdot p \leq m + p \).
  Thus, we have shown that there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( m \cdot n \leq m + n \) for \( m = 1 \).

  -- Choose m = 1
  use 1, by norm_num
  -- For m = 1, choose p = 0
  use 0
  -- Verify that 1 * 0 ≤ 1 + 0
