  We need to show that for any positive integer \( m \), there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( m \cdot n \le m + n \). We will demonstrate this by constructing a specific example for any given positive integer \( n \).
  1. Choose \( m = n + 1 \).
  2. Verify that \( m > n \).
  3. Choose \( p = 0 \).
  4. Verify that \( m \cdot p = (n + 1) \cdot 0 = 0 \) and \( m + p = (n + 1) + 0 = n + 1 \).
  5. Check that \( 0 \le n + 1 \) (which is true since \( 0 \) is less than or equal to any positive integer).
  Thus, we have shown that there exists a positive integer \( m \) such that \( m > n \) and there exists a positive integer \( p \) such that \( m \cdot p \le m + p \).
