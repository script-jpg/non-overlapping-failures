  For any positive integer \( n \), we need to find a positive integer \( m \) such that \( m \cdot n \leq m + n \). We propose \( m = n + 1 \). Substituting \( m = n + 1 \) into the inequality \( m \cdot n \leq m + n \), we get:
  \[
  (n + 1) \cdot n \leq (n + 1) + n
  \]
  Expanding both sides, we have:
  \[
  n^2 + n \leq n + 1 + n
  \]
  Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:
  \[
  n^2 + n \leq 2n + 1
  \]
  Subtracting \( n^2 \) from both sides, we obtain:
  \[
  n \leq 2n + 1 - n^2
  \]
  Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:
  \[
  n \leq 2n + 1 - n^2 = 2n - n^2 + 1
  \]
  This completes the proof.
