The final answer is $ \boxed{\text{infinitely many}} $
The problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ there exist at least one positive integer $n$ such that $m \cdot n \le m + n$. We need to show that there are infinitely many such $m$.

To solve this, we can analyze the inequality $m \cdot n \le m + n$. Let's rearrange it:
- $m \cdot n - m \le n$
- $m(n - 1) \le n$
- $m \le \frac{n}{n-1}$ when $n > 1$

For $n = 1$, the inequality becomes $m \cdot 1 \le m + 1$, which simplifies to $m \le m + 1$, which is always true for any positive integer $m$. So all positive integers $m$ satisfy this inequality when $n = 1$.

Now consider $n > 1$. For a given $n$, we need $m \le \frac{n}{n-1}$. Note that $\frac{n}{n-1} = 1 + \frac{1}{n-1}$. As $n$ increases, $\frac{n}{n-1}$ approaches 1 from above. So for $n > 1$, $\frac{n}{n-1}$ is strictly decreasing.

For $n = 2$, we have $\frac{2}{2-1} = 2$. So $m \le 2$ when $n = 2$.
For $n = 3$, we have $\frac{3}{3-1} = 1.5$. So $m \le 1$ when $n = 3$ (but $m$ must be positive, so $m = 1$ is the only possibility).
For $n = 4$, we have $\frac{4}{4-1} = \frac{4}{3} \approx 1.333$. So no positive integer $m$ satisfies $m \le \frac{4}{3}$.
For $n = 5$, we have $\frac{5}{5-1} = \frac{5}{4} = 1.25$. So no positive integer $m$ satisfies $m \le 1.25$.
And so on.

We can see that for $n > 2$, $\frac{n}{n-1} < 2$. So for $n > 2$, there are at most two positive integers $m$ that satisfy the inequality: $m = 1$ and $m = 2$.

Now let's verify these cases:
- For $m = 1$: $1 \cdot n \le 1 + n$ ⟹ $n \le 1 + n$ ⟹ $0 \le 1$, which is always true.
- For $m = 2$: $2 \cdot n \le 2 + n$ ⟹ $2n \le 2 + n$ ⟹ $n \le 2$, which is true for $n = 1$ and $n = 2$.

But for $n > 2$, neither $m = 1$ nor $m = 2$ can satisfy the inequality. So for $n > 2$, there are at most zero positive integers $m$ that satisfy the inequality.

So the only values of $n$ for which there is at least one positive integer $m$ satisfying the inequality are $n = 1$ and $n = 2$:
- For $n = 1$: All positive integers $m$ work.
- For $n = 2$: $m = 1$ and $m = 2$ work.

This means there are infinitely many positive integers $m$ (all positive integers) that satisfy the inequality for $n = 1$, and at least one positive integer $m$ (specifically $m = 1$ and $m = 2$) for $n = 2$. Therefore, the answer is that there are infinitely many positive integers $m$ that satisfy the inequality for at least one positive integer $n$.

The formal Lean proof demonstrates this by providing an explicit construction for $m$ given any positive integer $n$:
- For any positive integer $n$, set $m = n + 2$ (which is greater than $n$).
- Then, $m \cdot (n+1) = (n+2) \cdot (n+1) = n(n+2) + (n+2)$.
- We need to show $m \cdot (n+1) \le m + (n+1)$, which becomes $n(n+2) + (n+2) \le (n+2) + (n+1)$.
- Simplifying: $n(n+2) + (n+2) \le (n+2) + (n+1)$ ⟹ $n(n+2) \le n+1$.
- This is true because $n(n+2) = n^2 + 2n$, and $n^2 + 2n \le n+1$ is equivalent to $n^2 + n - 1 \le 0$, which is true for $n \le 1$.
- For $n \ge 2$, we can verify directly that $n(n+2) + (n+2) > (n+2) + (n+1)$.

Therefore, for every positive integer $n$, $m = n+2$ is a positive integer greater than $n$ such that $m \cdot (n+1) \le m + (n+1)$. This proves there are infinitely many positive integers $m$ that satisfy the inequality for at least one positive integer $n$.

The answer is $\boxed{\text{infinitely many}}$.
