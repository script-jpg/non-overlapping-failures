# Solving the AMC12A 2002 Problem 6

I'll solve this problem about finding positive integers $m$ where there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $m \cdot n \le m + n$. We need to determine if there are finitely or infinitely many such $m$.

First, let's think about how to approach this problem. We need to find all positive integers $m$ for which there exists some positive integer $n$ satisfying $m \cdot n \le m + n$.

Let's rearrange the inequality $m \cdot n \le m + n$ to see if we can find a relationship between $m$ and $n$ that must hold:

$m \cdot n \le m + n$

$m \cdot n - n \le m$

$n(m - 1) \le m$

If $m > 1$, then $n \le \frac{m}{m-1}$.

Since $m$ and $n$ are positive integers, and $\frac{m}{m-1} = 1 + \frac{1}{m-1}$, for $m > 1$, the inequality $n \le \frac{m}{m-1}$ means that for $m > 1$, $n$ must be 1 or less. But since $n$ is a positive integer, $n = 1$ is the only possibility.

Let's check if $n = 1$ satisfies the original inequality when $m > 1$:

$m \cdot 1 \le m + 1$

$m \le m + 1$

This is always true for any positive integer $m > 0$, so for any $m > 1$, we can take $n = 1$ and the inequality holds.

Now, what about the case $m = 1$?

If $m = 1$, then we need $1 \cdot n \le 1 + n$, which simplifies to $n \le 1 + n$, which is also always true for any positive integer $n$. So $m = 1$ works with any positive integer $n$.

Therefore, for all positive integers $m$, we can find a positive integer $n$ (specifically $n = 1$) such that $m \cdot n \le m + n$. 

This means there are infinitely many positive integers $m$ satisfying the condition. 

In Lean, we can prove this as follows:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

Now we'll define the theorem statement. We need to show that for any positive integer $n$, there exists a larger positive integer $m$ such that there exists a positive integer $p$ where $m \cdot p \le m + p$.

Wait, actually, the original problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $m \cdot n \le m + n$. The Lean theorem is formulated differently. Let's re-examine the Lean theorem:

```tactics
theorem amc12a_2002_p6 (n : ℕ) (h₀ : 0 < n) : ∃ m, m > n ∧ ∃ p, m * p ≤ m + p := by
```

This theorem is saying that for any positive integer $n$, there exists an $m$ greater than $n$ such that there exists some $p$ where $m \cdot p \le m + p$. 

This is a different formulation from the original problem. The original problem asks how many positive integers $m$ have at least one positive integer $n$ such that $m \cdot n \le m + n$. 

The Lean theorem is asking to prove that for every positive integer $n$, there is a larger positive integer $m$ such that there exists some $p$ where $m \cdot p \le m + p$. 

To prove the Lean theorem, we need to show that given any $n > 0$, we can find an $m > n$ and some $p$ such that $m \cdot p \le m + p$. 

Let's think about how to prove this. If we take $m = n + 1$ and $p = 1$, then we need to check if $(n + 1) \cdot 1 \le (n + 1) + 1$:

$(n + 1) \cdot 1 = n + 1 \le n + 2 = (n + 1) + 1$

This is true, so $m = n + 1 > n$ and $p = 1$ satisfies the inequality. 

Therefore, for any positive integer $n$, we can find $m = n + 1 > n$ and $p = 1$ such that $m \cdot p \le m + p$. 

This shows that there are infinitely many positive integers $m$ satisfying the condition, since for every $n$, there's a larger $m$. 

Let's complete the proof in Lean:

```tactics
have h₁ : n ≥ 1 := by linarith

use (n + 1)

constructor

linarith

use (1)

have h₂ : (n + 1) * 1 ≤ (n + 1) + 1 := by linarith

exact h₂
```

So the proof is complete. For any positive integer $n$, we can take $m = n + 1 > n$ and $p = 1$ to satisfy $m \cdot p \le m + p$. 

This means there are infinitely many positive integers $m$ satisfying the condition, so the answer is $\boxed{\text{infinitely many}}$.
