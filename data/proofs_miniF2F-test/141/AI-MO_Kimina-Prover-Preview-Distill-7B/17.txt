The proof shows that for any positive integer $n$, there exists a positive integer $m = n + 1$ such that $m \cdot n \le m + n$. This implies that there are infinitely many positive integers $m$ satisfying the inequality, as for every $n$ we can find such an $m$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{E}$.
</-- For how many positive integers $m$ does there exist at least one positive integer n such that $m \cdot n \le m + n$?

$ \textbf{(A) } 4\qquad \textbf{(B) } 6\qquad \textbf{(C) } 9\qquad \textbf{(D) } 12\qquad \textbf{(E) } \text{infinitely many} $ Show that it is \textbf{(E) } \text{infinitely many}.-/
