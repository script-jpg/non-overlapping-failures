# Solving the AMC12A 2002 Problem 6

We need to prove that for any positive integer $n$, there exists a positive integer $m$ greater than $n$ such that $m \cdot n \leq m + n$.

Let's start by understanding the inequality $m \cdot n \leq m + n$. We can rearrange it as:

$$m \cdot n - m \leq n$$

$$m(n - 1) \leq n$$

If $n = 1$, the inequality becomes $m \cdot 1 \leq m + 1$, which simplifies to $m \leq m + 1$, which is always true for any positive integer $m$. 

For $n > 1$, we have:

$$m \leq \frac{n}{n - 1}$$

Since $m$ must be a positive integer, we need $m \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{n - 1} \rfloor$. However, for $n > 1$, $\frac{n}{n - 1} = 1 + \frac{1}{n - 1} > 1$. So $\lfloor \frac{n}{n - 1} \rfloor = 1$.

This suggests that for $n > 1$, the only positive integer $m$ satisfying the inequality is $m = 1$. But we need $m > n$, which would mean $1 > n$. This is only true for $n = 1$.

Wait, this analysis seems contradictory. Let's try another approach.

Suppose we choose $m = n + 1$. Then the inequality becomes:

$$(n + 1) \cdot n \leq (n + 1) + n$$

Expanding the left side: $n^2 + n \leq 2n + 1$

Rearranging: $n^2 - n - 1 \leq 0$

This is a quadratic inequality. For $n \geq 2$, $n^2 - n - 1 \geq 2^2 - 2 - 1 = 1 > 0$. So the inequality is false for $n \geq 2$.

Wait, this also doesn't seem right. Let's analyze again.

For $m = n + 1$, the inequality $m \cdot n \leq m + n$ becomes:

$$(n + 1) \cdot n \leq (n + 1) + n$$

Expanding: $n^2 + n \leq 2n + 1$

Rearranging: $n^2 - n - 1 \leq 0$

This inequality is indeed true for $n = 1$: $1^2 - 1 - 1 = -1 \leq 0$.

For $n = 2$: $2^2 - 2 - 1 = 4 - 2 - 1 = 1 \not\leq 0$.

Wait, we made a mistake. For $n = 2$, $m = n + 1 = 3$, we have $3 \cdot 2 = 6 > 3 + 2 = 5$, so the inequality is false.

Wait, let's try $m = n + 1$ again. For $m = n + 1$, we have:

$$m \cdot n = (n + 1) \cdot n = n^2 + n$$

$$m + n = (n + 1) + n = 2n + 1$$

We need $n^2 + n \leq 2n + 1$, which simplifies to $n^2 - n - 1 \leq 0$.

This inequality holds for $n = 1$ (as we saw), but for $n \geq 2$, $n^2 - n - 1 > 0$. So $m = n + 1$ only works when $n = 1$.

However, the problem asks for how many positive integers $m$ exist such that there is at least one positive integer $n$ with $m \cdot n \leq m + n$. 

For $m = n + 1$, we need to find a positive integer $n$ where $m \cdot n \leq m + n$:
- For $n = 1$, $m = 2$: $2 \cdot 1 = 2 \leq 2 + 1 = 3$ is true
- For $n = 2$, $m = 3$: $3 \cdot 2 = 6 \not\leq 3 + 2 = 5$ is false 
- For $n = 3$, $m = 4$: $4 \cdot 3 = 12 \not\leq 4 + 3 = 7$ is false 
- etc.

So $m = n + 1$ only works for $n = 1$. Therefore, for any $m \geq 2$, we can find an $n$ where $m \cdot n \leq m + n$ is false.

Wait, this suggests that for $m \geq 2$, there exists an $n$ where $m \cdot n > m + n$ for all $n$. 

Let's prove this formally in Lean:

```tactics

We need to show that for any positive integer $n$, there exists a positive integer $m$ greater than $n$ such that $m \cdot n \leq m + n$.

```tactics
theorem amc12a_2002_p6 (n : ℕ) (h₀ : 0 < n) : ∃ m, m > n ∧ ∃ p, m * p ≤ m + p := by
```

Let's prove this by constructing a specific value of $m$ for any given $n > 0$.

```tactics
have h₁ : n ≥ 1 := by linarith
```

We need to find a positive integer $m$ such that $m > n$ and there exists a positive integer $p$ with $m \cdot p \leq m + p$.

Let's try $m = n + 1$:

- For $m = n + 1$ to be greater than $n$: $n + 1 > n$ is true for any $n \geq 0$
- We need to find $p$ such that $(n + 1) \cdot p \leq (n + 1) + p$
- Simplifying: $n \cdot p + p \leq n + 1 + p$
- $n \cdot p \leq n + 1$
- For $n \geq 1$, if $p = 1$: $n \cdot 1 \leq n + 1$ is true

So $m = n + 1$ and $p = 1$ should work.

```tactics
use (n + 1)
constructor
· linarith
```

So far, we've shown that $m = n + 1 > n$. 

Now we need to find a positive integer $p$ such that $(n + 1) \cdot p \leq (n + 1) + p$.

For $p = 1$:
$(n + 1) \cdot 1 \leq (n + 1) + 1$ 
$n + 1 \leq n + 2$ 
$1 \leq 2$ 
This is true.

Let's complete the proof:

```tactics
· use 1
  have h₂ : (n + 1) * 1 = n + 1 := by ring
  linarith
```

The proof is complete! We've shown that for any positive integer $n$, $m = n + 1$ is a positive integer greater than $n$ such that $m \cdot 1 \leq m + 1$.

This means there are infinitely many positive integers $m$ (specifically, all integers $m = n + 1$ where $n > 0$) that satisfy the condition. Therefore, the answer is \textbf{(E) } \text{infinitely many}.
