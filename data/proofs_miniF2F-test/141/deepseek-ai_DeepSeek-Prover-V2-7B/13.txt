-- Simplify the problem by reducing it to finding the range of m and n values where the inequality holds.
-- Use the fact that the inequality can be rearranged to m * n - m - n ≤ 0, which factors to (m - 1)(n - 1) ≤ 1.
-- This implies that both m - 1 and n - 1 must be 1, leading to m = 2 and n = 2 as the only solution.
-- However, the problem is more nuanced, and a detailed analysis shows that there are infinitely many solutions.
-- Specifically, for each n, there exists an m such that m * n ≤ m + n.
-- This is because for n ≥ 1, m = 1 works, and for n > 1, m = n works.
-- Therefore, the correct answer is infinitely many solutions, which is option E.
