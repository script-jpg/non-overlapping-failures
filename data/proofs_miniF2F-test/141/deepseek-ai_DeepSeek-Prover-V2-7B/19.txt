have h₁ : ∃ m, m > n ∧ ∃ p, m * p ≤ m + p := by
    /-
    We need to find a positive integer \( m \) such that \( m > n \) and there exists a positive integer \( p \) satisfying \( m \cdot p \leq m + p \).
    
    Assume \( m > n \). We need to find \( p \) such that:
    \[ m \cdot p \leq m + p \]
    Rearrange the inequality:
    \[ m \cdot p - p \leq m \]
    \[ p(m - 1) \leq m \]
    \[ p \leq \frac{m}{m - 1} \]
    Since \( m > n \), we can choose \( p = 1 \):
    \[ 1 \leq \frac{m}{m - 1} \]
    This holds for all \( m > 1 \). Therefore, for any \( n \), we can choose \( m = n + 1 \) and \( p = 1 \).
    
    Thus, the number of possible values of \( m \) is infinite.
