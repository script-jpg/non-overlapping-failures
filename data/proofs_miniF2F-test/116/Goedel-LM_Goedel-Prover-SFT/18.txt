  For all integers \( n \geq 9 \), we need to show that the value of \(\frac{(n+2)! - (n+1)!}{n!}\) is a perfect square. We will demonstrate that this value is \( (n+1)^2 \).
  1. Start by simplifying the expression \(\frac{(n+2)! - (n+1)!}{n!}\).
  2. Expand the factorials using the definition of factorial.
  3. Simplify the numerator by distributing the terms.
  4. Factor out \( n! \) from the numerator.
  5. Simplify the resulting expression to show that it equals \( (n+1)^2 \).
