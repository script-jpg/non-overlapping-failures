  For all integers \( n \geq 9 \), the value of \(\frac{(n+2)! - (n+1)!}{n!}\) is always a perfect square. Specifically, we need to show that there exists an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 = \frac{(n+2)! - (n+1)!}{n!} \). This can be achieved by demonstrating that the expression \(\frac{(n+2)! - (n+1)!}{n!}\) simplifies to a perfect square.

  -- We need to find an integer x such that x^2 equals the given factorial expression.
  -- We propose x = (n + 2) - (n + 1) as a candidate for the integer.
  use (n + 2) - (n + 1)
  -- Simplify the factorial expression to show that it is indeed a perfect square.
