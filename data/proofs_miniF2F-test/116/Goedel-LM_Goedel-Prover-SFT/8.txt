  For all integers \( n \geq 9 \), we need to show that the value of \(\frac{(n+2)! - (n+1)!}{n!}\) is always a perfect square. We will demonstrate that this value is a perfect square by expressing it as \( x^2 \) for some natural number \( x \).

  /- We need to show that \(\left(\frac{(n+2)! - (n+1)!}{n!}\right)^2\) is a perfect square. We claim that \( x = \frac{(n+1)!}{n!} \) satisfies this condition. To verify this, we simplify the expression and check that it is indeed a perfect square. -/
