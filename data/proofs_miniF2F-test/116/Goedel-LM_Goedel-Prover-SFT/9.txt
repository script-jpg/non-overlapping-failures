  For all integers \( n \geq 9 \), we need to show that the value of \(\frac{(n+2)! - (n+1)!}{n!}\) is a perfect square. We will demonstrate that this value is a perfect square by expressing it as \( x^2 \) for some natural number \( x \).
  -/
  -- We will show that the expression is a perfect square by finding a natural number x such that x^2 equals the given expression.
  use (n + 1)! / n!
  -- Simplify the expression to show that it is indeed a perfect square.
  field_simp [factorial_ne_zero, h₀]
  -- Normalize the expression to show that it is a perfect square.
  ring_nf
  -- Ensure that the expression is a perfect square by showing that the arithmetic operations hold.
  norm_cast
  -- Simplify the expression further to confirm that it is a perfect square.
