  We need to show that for all integers \( n \geq 9 \), the value of \(\frac{(n+2)! - (n+1)!}{n!}\) is a perfect square. We will demonstrate that this value is \( (n+1)^2 \).
  First, we express the factorials in terms of their definitions:
  \[
  (n+2)! = (n+2) \cdot (n+1) \cdot n! \quad \text{and} \quad (n+1)! = (n+1) \cdot n!
  \]
  Substituting these into the expression, we get:
  \[
  \frac{(n+2)! - (n+1)!}{n!} = \frac{(n+2) \cdot (n+1) \cdot n! - (n+1) \cdot n!}{n!}
  \]
  Factoring out \( n! \) from the numerator:
  \[
  \frac{(n+1) \cdot n! \cdot (n+2 - 1)}{n!} = (n+1) \cdot (n+1) = (n+1)^2
  \]
  Thus, we have shown that \(\frac{(n+2)! - (n+1)!}{n!} = (n+1)^2\), confirming that it is indeed a perfect square.
