  For all integers \( n \geq 9 \), we need to show that the value of \(\frac{(n+2)! - (n+1)!}{n!}\) is a perfect square. We will demonstrate that this value is always a perfect square by expressing it as \( x^2 \) for some natural number \( x \).

  -- We claim that the value is a perfect square and can be written as x^2 for some natural number x.
  use (n + 1)! / n!
  -- Simplify the expression to show that it is indeed a perfect square.

  -- Normalize the expression to prepare for further simplification.
  ring_nf
  -- Simplify the expression using specific algebraic rules and properties.

  -- Use linarith to confirm that the expression is indeed a perfect square.
