  We need to show that for all integers \( n \geq 9 \), the value of \(\frac{(n+2)! - (n+1)!}{n!}\) is always a perfect square. We will demonstrate this by showing that the expression simplifies to a perfect square.
  -/
  use ((n + 2)! - (n + 1)!) / n!
  -- Simplify the expression to show that it is a perfect square.
  field_simp [Nat.factorial_ne_zero, h₀]
  -- Normalize the expression to prepare for further simplification.
  ring_nf
  -- Simplify the expression using specific algebraic rules and properties.
  norm_cast
  -- Use the omega tactic to solve the resulting linear arithmetic problem.
