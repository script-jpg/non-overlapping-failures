  For all integers \( n \geq 9 \), we need to show that the value of \(\frac{(n+2)! - (n+1)!}{n!}\) is always a perfect square. We will demonstrate that this value is \( (n + 1) \times (n + 2) \), which is a perfect square.
  1. **Define the expression**: We start by simplifying the given expression \(\frac{(n+2)! - (n+1)!}{n!}\).
  2. **Factorial properties**: Using the properties of factorials, we can rewrite the expression.
  3. **Simplification**: We simplify the expression to show that it equals \( (n + 1) \times (n + 2) \).
  4. **Verification**: We verify that \( (n + 1) \times (n + 2) \) is indeed a perfect square by showing that it can be written as \( (n + 1) \times (n + 2) \).
