  We need to show that for all integers \( n \geq 9 \), the value of \(\frac{(n+2)! - (n+1)!}{n!}\) is always a perfect square. We will prove this by demonstrating that the expression simplifies to a perfect square.
  1. Start by expressing the factorials in terms of \( n \).
  2. Simplify the expression \(\frac{(n+2)! - (n+1)!}{n!}\) using the definition of factorial.
  3. Show that the simplified expression is a perfect square.
  -/
  -- We claim that the expression simplifies to a perfect square.
  use (n + 2)! / n! - (n + 1)! / n!
  -- Simplify the expression using the definition of factorial.
  simp [Nat.factorial_ne_zero, h₀]
  -- Normalize the expression to show that it is a perfect square.
  ring_nf
  -- Simplify the expression further to confirm it is a perfect square.
  field_simp [h₀]
  -- Normalize the expression again to ensure it is in the simplest form.
