  For all integers \( n \geq 9 \), we need to show that the value of \(\frac{(n+2)! - (n+1)!}{n!}\) is always a perfect square. We will demonstrate that this value is a perfect square by showing that it equals some natural number squared.
  -/
  -- We claim that the value is a perfect square and can be expressed as some natural number squared.
  use (Nat.factorial (n + 2) - Nat.factorial (n + 1)) / Nat.factorial n
  -- Simplify the expression to show that it is indeed a perfect square.
  field_simp [Nat.factorial_ne_zero, h₀]
  -- Normalize the expression to show that it is a perfect square.
  ring_nf
  -- Cast the expression to the appropriate type to confirm it is a perfect square.
