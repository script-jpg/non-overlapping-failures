  For all integers \( n \geq 9 \), we need to show that the expression \(\frac{(n+2)! - (n+1)!}{n!}\) is a perfect square. We will demonstrate that this expression is indeed a perfect square by finding the appropriate \( x \) such that \( x^2 \) equals the given expression.
  -/
  -- We claim that the appropriate x is (n + 1).
  use n + 1
  -- Simplify the expression to show that (n + 1)^2 equals the given expression.
  simp [Nat.factorial_succ, Nat.mul_div_cancel_left]
  -- Normalize the expression to match the form of (n + 1)^2.
  ring_nf
  -- Simplify the expression further to confirm it matches the form of (n + 1)^2.
  field_simp
  -- Use linarith to confirm the inequality holds and the proof is complete.
