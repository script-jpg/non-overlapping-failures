  For all integers \( n \geq 9 \), we need to determine the value of \(\frac{(n+2)! - (n+1)!}{n!}\) and show that it is always a perfect square. We will use induction to demonstrate this.
  1. **Base Case**: When \( n = 9 \), we calculate the expression.
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the expression is a perfect square for some \( n \geq 9 \). We need to show it remains a perfect square for \( n + 1 \).
