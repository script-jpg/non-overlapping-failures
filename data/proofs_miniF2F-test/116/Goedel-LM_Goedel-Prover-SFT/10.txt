  For all integers \( n \geq 9 \), we need to show that the value of \(\frac{(n+2)! - (n+1)!}{n!}\) is always a perfect square. We will demonstrate this by finding a natural number \( x \) such that \( x^2 = \frac{(n+2)! - (n+1)!}{n!} \).

  -- We will show that the expression simplifies to a perfect square.
  use ∏ k in Finset.Icc 1 (n + 2), (n + 2 - k)
  -- Simplify the expression involving factorials.
  field_simp [Finset.prod_Icc_succ_top, factorial_succ, mul_comm]
  -- Normalize the expression to show it is a perfect square.
  ring_nf
  -- Ensure the expression is in the correct form.
