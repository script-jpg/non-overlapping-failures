  We need to show that for all integers \( n \geq 9 \), the value of \(\frac{(n+2)! - (n+1)!}{n!}\) is a perfect square. We will prove this by providing a specific value \( x \) such that \( x^2 = \frac{(n+2)! - (n+1)!}{n!} \).

  -- We claim that x = (n+1)! / n! satisfies the equation.
  use (n + 1)! / n!
  -- Simplify the equation to show that it holds true.
