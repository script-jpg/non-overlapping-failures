  For all integers \( n \geq 9 \), we need to show that the value of \(\frac{(n+2)! - (n+1)!}{n!}\) is a perfect square. We will demonstrate that this value is \( (n + 1) \times (n + 2) \), which is a perfect square.

  -- Simplify the expression further by casting it to the appropriate types.
  norm_cast
  -- Normalize the expression again to achieve the final simplified form.
