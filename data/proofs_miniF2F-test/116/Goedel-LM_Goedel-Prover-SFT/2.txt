  For all integers \( n \geq 9 \), we need to show that the value of \(\frac{(n+2)! - (n+1)!}{n!}\) is a perfect square. We will demonstrate that this value is always a perfect square by expressing it as \( (n + 1 - \frac{1}{n})(n + 1 + \frac{1}{n}) \), which simplifies to \( (n + 1 - \frac{1}{n})(n + 1 + \frac{1}{n}) \). This expression is a difference of squares, and thus it is a perfect square.
