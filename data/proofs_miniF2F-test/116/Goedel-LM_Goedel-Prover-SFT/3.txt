  For all integers \( n \geq 9 \), we need to show that the value of \(\frac{(n+2)! - (n+1)!}{n!}\) is always a multiple of 4.
  1. **Base Case**: When \( n = 9 \), we calculate \(\frac{(9+2)! - (9+1)!}{9!}\).
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds for \( n \). We need to show it holds for \( n+1 \).
