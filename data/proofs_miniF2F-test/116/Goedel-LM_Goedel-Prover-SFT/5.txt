  To show that for all integers \( n \geq 9 \), the value of \(\frac{(n+2)! - (n+1)!}{n!}\) is a perfect square, we proceed as follows:
  1. **Expression Simplification**: We start by simplifying the given expression \(\frac{(n+2)! - (n+1)!}{n!}\).
  2. **Factorization and Simplification**: We factorize the numerator \((n+2)! - (n+1)!\) and simplify the fraction.
  3. **Verification of Perfect Square**: We verify that the simplified expression is indeed a perfect square.
