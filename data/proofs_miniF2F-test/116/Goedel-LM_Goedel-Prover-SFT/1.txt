  For all integers \( n \geq 9 \), we need to show that the value of \(\frac{(n+2)! - (n+1)!}{n!}\) is a perfect square. We will demonstrate this by showing that the expression simplifies to \(2(n+1)\), which is a perfect square.

  -- Simplify the expression using factorial properties and algebraic manipulation.
  -- Specifically, we use the fact that (n+2)! = (n+2) * (n+1)! and (n+1)! = (n+1) * n!.
  -- By simplifying the fraction, we show that it equals (2 * (n + 1))^2.
