  To determine the number of solutions to the equation \(\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2} \cos x\right) = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2} \sin x\right)\) in the closed interval \([0, \pi]\), we start by analyzing the trigonometric identities involved.
  First, we use the identity for the sine of a sum:
  \[
  \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2} \cos x\right) = \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2} \cos x + 0\right) = \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2} \cos x\right)
  \]
  Next, we use the identity for the cosine of a sum:
  \[
  \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2} \sin x\right) = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2} \sin x + 0\right) = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2} \sin x\right)
  \]
  Given the symmetry and periodicity of the trigonometric functions, we can infer that the solutions to the equation are the points where the arguments of the sine and cosine functions are such that their values are equal. This occurs at specific points within the interval \([0, \pi]\).
  By examining the distribution of solutions, we find that there are exactly two points where the equation holds true. These points are \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) and \(\frac{3\pi}{4}\).
  Thus, the number of solutions is \(2\).
