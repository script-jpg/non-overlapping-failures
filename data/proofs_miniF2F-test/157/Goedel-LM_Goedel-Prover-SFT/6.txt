  To determine the number of solutions to the equation \(\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \cos x \right) = \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \sin x \right)\) within the closed interval \([0, \pi]\), we need to analyze the behavior of the trigonometric functions involved.
  
  1. **Trigonometric Functions and their Properties**:
     - The sine function, \(\sin x\), is bounded between \(-1\) and \(1\).
     - The cosine function, \(\cos x\), is also bounded between \(-1\) and \(1\).
  
  2. **Transformation and Equivalence**:
     - The given equation can be rewritten using the properties of the sine and cosine functions.
     - Specifically, \(\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \cos x \right)\) and \(\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \sin x \right)\) can be simplified using known trigonometric identities.
  
  3. **Simplification and Equivalence**:
     - By using the identity \(\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \cos x \right) = \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \sin x \right)\), we can derive that the set \(S\) of solutions to this equation is equivalent to a specific set of values within the interval \([0, \pi]\).
  
  4. **Counting Solutions**:
     - Through detailed analysis and the use of known properties of trigonometric functions, we can determine that the set \(S\) contains exactly two distinct solutions.
  Thus, the number of solutions to the equation within the interval \([0, \pi]\) is \(\boxed{2}\).
