  To determine the value of the expression \(-a - b^2 + 3ab\) given \(a = -1\) and \(b = 5\), we proceed as follows:
  1. Substitute \(a = -1\) and \(b = 5\) into the expression.
  2. Calculate each term:
     - \(-a = -(-1) = 1\)
     - \(-b^2 = -(5^2) = -25\)
     - \(3ab = 3(-1)(5) = -15\)
  3. Combine these results:
     - \(1 - 25 - 15 = -39\)
  Thus, the value of the expression is \(-39\).
