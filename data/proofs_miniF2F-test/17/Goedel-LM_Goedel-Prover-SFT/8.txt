  To determine the value of \(-a - b^2 + 3ab\) given \(a = -1\) and \(b = 5\), we substitute the values of \(a\) and \(b\) into the expression and simplify step by step.
  1. Substitute \(a = -1\) and \(b = 5\) into the expression.
  2. Calculate \(-a\) which becomes \(1\).
  3. Calculate \(b^2\) which becomes \(25\).
  4. Calculate \(3ab\) which becomes \(3(-1)(5) = -15\).
  5. Combine the results: \(1 - 25 - 15 = -39\).
  Thus, the value of \(-a - b^2 + 3ab\) is \(-39\).
