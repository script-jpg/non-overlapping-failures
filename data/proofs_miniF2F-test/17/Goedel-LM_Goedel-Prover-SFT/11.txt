  To solve the expression \(-a - b^2 + 3ab\) given \(a = -1\) and \(b = 5\), we substitute \(a\) and \(b\) into the expression and simplify step by step.
  1. Substitute \(a = -1\) and \(b = 5\) into the expression:
     \[
     -(-1) - 5^2 + 3(-1)(5)
     \]
  2. Simplify the expression:
     \[
     1 - 25 - 15
     \]
  3. Combine the terms:
     \[
     1 - 25 - 15 = -39
     \]
  Thus, the value of \(-a - b^2 + 3ab\) is \(-39\).
