The key insight in this problem is to carefully substitute the values of $a$ and $b$ and then perform the arithmetic operations. The substitution yields $-(-1) - 5^2 + 3(-1)(5) = 1 - 25 - 15 = 1 - 25 - 15 = -39$. The formal proof follows this calculation exactly. We first substitute the given values of $a$ and $b$ into the expression $-a - b^2 + 3ab$. 

After substitution, we have $-(-1) - 5^2 + 3(-1)(5)$. 

Let's calculate each term:
- $-(-1) = 1$ (the negative of a negative number is positive)
- $5^2 = 25$ 
- $3(-1)(5) = -15$ 

So the expression becomes $1 - 25 - 15 = 1 - 25 - 15 = -39$. 

The Lean proof is remarkably concise because Lean's automation is powerful enough to solve straightforward arithmetic problems like this one. The `rw` tactic substitutes the values of $a$ and $b$, and then the `aesop` tactic performs the arithmetic to verify that the result is indeed $-39$.
