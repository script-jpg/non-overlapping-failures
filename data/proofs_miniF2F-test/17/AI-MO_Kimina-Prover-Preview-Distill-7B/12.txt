The proof is straightforward: we substitute the given values of $a$ and $b$ into the expression $-a-b^2+3ab$, and then compute the result.

First, substituting $a = -1$ and $b = 5$ gives us:
$-(-1) - 5^2 + 3(-1)(5)$

Simplifying each term:
- $-(-1) = 1$
- $-5^2 = -(25) = -25$
- $3(-1)(5) = -15$

So the expression becomes $1 - 25 - 15 = 1 - 30 = -29$

Wait, let me re-calculate that carefully:
$-(-1) - 5^2 + 3(-1)(5) = 1 - 25 - 15 = 1 - 40 = -39$

Yes, that's correct. The value is indeed -39.

The Lean proof is elegant in its simplicity:
- `rw [h₀, h₁]` substitutes the given values into the expression
- `norm_num` is powerful enough to compute the resulting arithmetic expression directly

So our complete Lean 4 solution is:

theorem mathd_algebra_419 (a b : ℝ) (h₀ : a = -1) (h₁ : b = 5) : -a - b ^ 2 + 3 * (a * b) = -39 := by
  rw [h₀, h₁]
  norm_num
```

This proof demonstrates how Lean's computational capabilities can directly verify algebraic evaluations. The `norm_num` tactic is particularly powerful for these kinds of arithmetic calculations.
