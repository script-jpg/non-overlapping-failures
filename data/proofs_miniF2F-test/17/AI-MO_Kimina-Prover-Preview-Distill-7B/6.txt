This Lean proof demonstrates how to compute the value of the algebraic expression $-a-b^2+3ab$ when $a=-1$ and $b=5$. 

First, we substitute the values of $a$ and $b$ into the expression using the `rw` tactic. This replaces $a$ with $-1$ and $b$ with $5$ in our goal. 

After substitution, our goal becomes: $-(-1) - 5^2 + 3 \cdot ((-1) \cdot 5) = -39$

Simplifying this:
- $-(-1) = 1$
- $5^2 = 25$
- $3 \cdot ((-1) \cdot 5) = 3 \cdot (-5) = -15$

So the expression becomes: $1 - 25 - 15 = -39$

This is exactly what Lean's `norm_num` tactic does: it computes arithmetic goals involving concrete numbers. It will evaluate the numerical expression and prove that it equals -39.

Therefore, the value of $-a-b^2+3ab$ when $a=-1$ and $b=5$ is indeed -39.
