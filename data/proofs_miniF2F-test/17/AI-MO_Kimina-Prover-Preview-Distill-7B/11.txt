This Lean 4 proof is solving the algebra problem of finding the value of the expression $-a - b^2 + 3ab$ when $a = -1$ and $b = 5$. 

First, we substitute the given values of $a$ and $b$ into the expression:
- $a = -1$
- $b = 5$

Substituting these into $-a - b^2 + 3ab$, we get:
$-(-1) - 5^2 + 3(-1)(5)$

Simplifying each term:
- $-(-1) = 1$
- $-5^2 = -(25) = -25$
- $3(-1)(5) = -15$

Adding these together: $1 - 25 - 15 = 1 - 40 = -39$

The Lean proof is performing these calculations automatically with the `rw` (rewrite) and `norm_num` tactics. 

The `rw` tactic is substituting the variables with their given values, and then `norm_num` is computing the numerical result. 

Therefore, the final answer is indeed $\boxed{-39}$.
