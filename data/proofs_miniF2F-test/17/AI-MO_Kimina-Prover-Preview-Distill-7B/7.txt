This formal proof is evaluating the algebraic expression $-a - b^2 + 3ab$ when $a = -1$ and $b = 5$, and showing that it equals $-39$. Let's walk through the calculation manually to verify:

1. Substitute $a = -1$ and $b = 5$ into the expression:
   \[
   -(-1) - (5)^2 + 3(-1)(5)
   \]

2. Calculate each term:
   - $-(-1) = 1$
   - $(5)^2 = 25$
   - $3(-1)(5) = -15$

3. Combine the terms:
   \[
   1 - 25 - 15 = 1 - 40 = -39
   \]

The Lean proof uses `rw` (rewrite) to substitute the values of $a$ and $b$, and then `norm_num` to perform the arithmetic calculation. The calculation confirms that the value of the expression is indeed $-39$ when $a = -1$ and $b = 5$.
