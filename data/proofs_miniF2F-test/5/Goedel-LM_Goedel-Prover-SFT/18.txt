  To determine the units digit of the sum of the squares of the first nine positive integers, we need to compute the sum modulo 10. The sum of the squares of the first nine positive integers is given by:
  \[
  \sum_{x=1}^{9} x^2
  \]
  We can break this sum into individual terms and compute each term modulo 10. The units digits of the squares of the first nine positive integers are:
  \[
  1^2 = 1, \quad 2^2 = 4, \quad 3^2 = 9, \quad 4^2 = 6, \quad 5^2 = 5, \quad 6^2 = 6, \quad 7^2 = 9, \quad 8^2 = 4, \quad 9^2 = 1
  \]
  Adding these units digits together:
  \[
  1 + 4 + 9 + 6 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 4 + 1 = 41
  \]
  Finally, we take the units digit of 41, which is 1. However, this result does not match the expected units digit of 5. Let's re-evaluate the sum and the units digits to ensure correctness.
