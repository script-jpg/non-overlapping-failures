  To determine the units digit of the sum of the squares of the first nine positive integers, we need to consider the units digits of the squares of these integers. The units digit of \((x+1)^2\) for \(x\) from 0 to 9 can be calculated as follows:
  - \(1^2 = 1\) (units digit is 1)
  - \(2^2 = 4\) (units digit is 4)
  - \(3^2 = 9\) (units digit is 9)
  - \(4^2 = 16\) (units digit is 6)
  - \(5^2 = 25\) (units digit is 5)
  - \(6^2 = 36\) (units digit is 6)
  - \(7^2 = 49\) (units digit is 9)
  - \(8^2 = 64\) (units digit is 4)
  - \(9^2 = 81\) (units digit is 1)
  Summing these units digits:
  \[1 + 4 + 9 + 6 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 4 + 1 = 45\]
  The units digit of 45 is 5. Therefore, the units digit of the sum of the squares of the first nine positive integers is 5.
