  To determine the units digit of the sum of the squares of the first nine positive integers, we need to compute the sum modulo 10. We start by expressing the sum of the squares of the first nine positive integers:
  \[
  \sum_{x=1}^{9} x^2
  \]
  We can compute this sum directly and then find its units digit. The units digit of the sum of the squares of the first nine integers is 5.
