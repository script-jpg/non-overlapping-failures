  To determine the units digit of the sum of the squares of the first nine positive integers, we need to compute the sum of the squares of the integers from 1 to 9 modulo 10. We can simplify this by first calculating the sum of the squares of the integers from 1 to 9 and then finding its remainder when divided by 10.
  The sum of the squares of the first \( n \) positive integers is given by the formula:
  \[ \sum_{k=1}^n k^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} \]
  For \( n = 9 \):
  \[ \sum_{k=1}^9 k^2 = \frac{9 \cdot 10 \cdot 19}{6} = 285 \]
  Next, we find the remainder of 285 when divided by 10:
  \[ 285 \mod 10 = 5 \]
  Thus, the units digit of the sum of the squares of the first nine positive integers is 5.

  -- The sum of the squares of the first n positive integers is given by n(n+1)(2n+1)/6.
  -- For n = 9, this sum is 285.
