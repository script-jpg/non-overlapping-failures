  To determine the units digit of the sum of the squares of the first nine positive integers, we need to find the units digit of the sum of the squares of the integers from 1 to 9. We observe that the units digit of the square of an integer is determined by the units digit of the integer. Specifically, the units digits of the squares of integers from 1 to 9 are:
  - \(1^2 = 1\) (units digit is 1)
  - \(2^2 = 4\) (units digit is 4)
  - \(3^2 = 9\) (units digit is 9)
  - \(4^2 = 16\) (units digit is 6)
  - \(5^2 = 25\) (units digit is 5)
  - \(6^2 = 36\) (units digit is 6)
  - \(7^2 = 49\) (units digit is 9)
  - \(8^2 = 64\) (units digit is 4)
  - \(9^2 = 81\) (units digit is 1)
  Summing these units digits:
  \[1 + 4 + 9 + 6 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 4 + 1 = 49\]
  The units digit of 49 is 9. However, we need to consider the sum of the squares of the integers from 1 to 9 modulo 10. We observe that the sum of the units digits of the squares of the integers from 1 to 9 is 5.
