  To determine the units digit of the sum of the squares of the first nine positive integers, we need to find the sum of the squares of the numbers from 1 to 9 and then determine the units digit of this sum. The units digit of a number is equivalent to the remainder when the number is divided by 10.
  First, we calculate the sum of the squares of the numbers from 1 to 9:
  \[ 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 \]
  Next, we compute the units digit of this sum. We can do this by finding the units digits of each square and then summing these units digits. The units digits of the squares of the numbers from 1 to 9 are:
  \[ 1, 4, 9, 6, 5, 6, 9, 4, 1 \]
  Summing these units digits:
  \[ 1 + 4 + 9 + 6 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 4 + 1 = 44 \]
  The units digit of 44 is 4. However, we need to consider the sum of the squares modulo 10, which simplifies to:
  \[ (1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + 5^2 + 6^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2) \mod 10 = 5 \]
  Thus, the units digit of the sum of the squares of the first nine positive integers is 5.
