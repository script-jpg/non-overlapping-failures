  To determine the units digit of the sum of the squares of the first nine positive integers, we start by calculating the sum of the squares of the integers from 1 to 9. The sum of the squares of the first \( n \) positive integers is given by the formula:
  \[ \sum_{k=1}^n k^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} \]
  For \( n = 9 \), this sum is:
  \[ \sum_{k=1}^9 k^2 = \frac{9 \cdot 10 \cdot 21}{6} = 315 \]
  Next, we find the units digit of 315. The units digit of a number is the remainder when the number is divided by 10. Therefore, we compute:
  \[ 315 \mod 10 = 5 \]
  Thus, the units digit of the sum of the squares of the first nine positive integers is 5.

  -- Calculate the sum of the squares of the first nine positive integers using the formula for the sum of squares of the first n positive integers.
  -- The sum of the squares of the first n positive integers is given by:
  -- ∑ x in Finset.range (n+1), (x+1)^2 = n * (n+1) * (2 * n + 1) / 6
  -- For n = 9, this sum is 315.
