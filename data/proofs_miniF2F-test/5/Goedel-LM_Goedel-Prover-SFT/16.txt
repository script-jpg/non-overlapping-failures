  To determine the units digit of the sum of the squares of the first nine positive integers, we start by calculating the sum of the squares of the integers from 1 to 9. The sum of the squares of the first \( n \) positive integers is given by the formula:
  \[
  \sum_{k=1}^n k^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
  \]
  For \( n = 9 \):
  \[
  \sum_{k=1}^9 k^2 = \frac{9 \cdot 10 \cdot 19}{6}
  \]
  Next, we compute the product inside the fraction:
  \[
  9 \cdot 10 = 90
  \]
  \[
  90 \cdot 19 = 1710
  \]
  Then, we divide by 6:
  \[
  \frac{1710}{6} = 285
  \]
  Finally, we find the units digit of 285, which is 5. Therefore, the units digit of the sum of the squares of the first nine positive integers is 5.
