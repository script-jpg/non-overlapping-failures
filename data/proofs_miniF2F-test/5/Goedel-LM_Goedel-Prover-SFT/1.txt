  To determine the units digit of the sum of the squares of the first nine positive integers, we need to compute the sum of the squares of the integers from 1 to 9 and then find the units digit of this sum. The sum of the squares of the integers from 1 to 9 is given by the formula for the sum of squares:
  \[
  \sum_{k=1}^9 k^2 = \frac{9 \cdot 10 \cdot 19}{6}
  \]
  Calculating this sum:
  \[
  \frac{9 \cdot 10 \cdot 19}{6} = 285
  \]
  Next, we need to find the units digit of 285. The units digit of a number \( n \) is the remainder when \( n \) is divided by 10. Therefore, the units digit of 285 is:
  \[
  285 \mod 10 = 5
  \]
  Thus, the units digit of the sum of the squares of the first nine positive integers is 5.
