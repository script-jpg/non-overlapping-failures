-- We want to compute the units digit of the sum of the squares of the first 9 positive integers, which is equivalent to finding the value of this sum modulo 10.

  -- We'll compute: 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 +... + 9^2, and find its units digit.

  -- The squares of the first 9 positive integers are: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81

  -- Their sum is: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 36 + 49 + 64 + 81

  -- Let's calculate the sum: 1 + 4 = 5, 5 + 9 = 14, 14 + 16 = 30, 30 + 25 = 55, 55 + 36 = 91, 91 + 49 = 140, 140 + 64 = 204, 204 + 81 = 285

  -- Now, to find the units digit of 285, we compute 285 % 10 = 5
