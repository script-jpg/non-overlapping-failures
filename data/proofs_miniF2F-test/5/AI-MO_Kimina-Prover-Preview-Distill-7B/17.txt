-- We need to compute the sum of the squares of the first nine positive integers, find its units digit, and show that it is 5.

  -- Let's first think about how we'd compute this sum. The first nine positive integers are 1 through 9. We need to find the sum of their squares:
  -- 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 +... + 9^2

  -- We could compute this directly:
  -- 1^2 = 1
  -- 2^2 = 4
  -- 3^2 = 9
  -- 4^2 = 16
  -- 5^2 = 25
  -- 6^2 = 36
  -- 7^2 = 49
  -- 8^2 = 64
  -- 9^2 = 81

  -- Summing these: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 36 + 49 + 64 + 81

  -- Let's compute the sum step by step:
  -- 1 + 4 = 5
  -- 5 + 9 = 14
  -- 14 + 16 = 30
  -- 30 + 25 = 55
  -- 55 + 36 = 91
  -- 91 + 49 = 140
  -- 140 + 64 = 204
  -- 204 + 81 = 285

  -- So the sum is 285. The units digit of 285 is 5.

  -- Now, let's formalize this in Lean 4:

  -- We'll start by importing the necessary libraries:
  import Mathlib
  import Aesop

  set_option maxHeartbeats 0

  open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat

  -- Now we'll state the theorem:
  theorem mathd_numbertheory_3 : (∑ x in Finset.range 10, (x + 1) ^ 2) % 10 = 5 := by
```

  -- The theorem statement is asking for the units digit of the sum of the squares of the first 9 positive integers. In Lean, we represent this as the sum of (x+1)^2 for x in the range 0..9, then taking the remainder when divided by 10.

  -- To prove this, we can compute the sum directly and then take its remainder when divided by 10. Lean's computational engine should be able to evaluate this arithmetic expression directly:

  norm_num [Finset.sum_range_succ, Nat.add_comm, Nat.add_assoc, Nat.mul_comm, Nat.pow_two]

  -- Let's explain what the `norm_num` tactic is doing here:

  -- `Finset.sum_range_succ` is a lemma that helps Lean compute sums over ranges. It likely expands the sum into an actual arithmetic expression.

  -- `Nat.add_comm` and `Nat.add_assoc` are commutativity and associativity laws for addition, which help Lean rearrange the terms in the sum.

  -- `Nat.mul_comm` is a commutativity law for multiplication, which helps with computing the squares.

  -- `Nat.pow_two` is a lemma that expands x^2 to x*x, which helps with computation.

  -- All together, these lemmas help Lean expand the sum into an arithmetic expression that can be computed directly. Lean will compute the sum of squares from 1^2 to 10^2, then compute the remainder when divided by 10, and verify that it equals 5.

  -- The Lean proof is remarkably concise because the problem is a direct computation. Lean's `norm_num` tactic is powerful enough to evaluate arithmetic expressions involving natural numbers, and the various lemmas help it handle the structure of the sum.

  -- In conclusion, the units digit of the sum of the squares of the first nine positive integers is indeed 5, and Lean's computational infrastructure is able to verify this directly.
