  To determine \( f(1982) \), we start by analyzing the given conditions and the properties of the function \( f \). We know that \( f(m+n) - f(m) - f(n) \) can only be 0 or 1 for any positive integers \( m \) and \( n \). We are given specific values \( f(2) = 0 \), \( f(3) > 0 \), and \( f(9999) = 3333 \).
  First, we use the property of the function to derive specific values for \( f \). By setting \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 1 \), we get:
  \[ f(1 + 1) - f(1) - f(1) = 0 \text{ or } 1 \]
  This implies:
  \[ f(2) - 2f(1) = 0 \text{ or } 1 \]
  Given \( f(2) = 0 \), we have:
  \[ 0 - 2f(1) = 0 \text{ or } 1 \]
  Solving for \( f(1) \):
  \[ 2f(1) = 0 \text{ or } 1 \]
  \[ f(1) = 0 \text{ or } \frac{1}{2} \]
  Since \( f(1) \) must be an integer, we have:
  \[ f(1) = 0 \]
  Next, we use the property again by setting \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 2 \):
  \[ f(1 + 2) - f(1) - f(2) = 0 \text{ or } 1 \]
  This implies:
  \[ f(3) - f(1) - 0 = 0 \text{ or } 1 \]
  Given \( f(3) > 0 \), we have:
  \[ f(3) - f(1) = 0 \text{ or } 1 \]
  \[ f(3) = f(1) \text{ or } f(3) = f(1) + 1 \]
  Since \( f(1) = 0 \), we have:
  \[ f(3) = 0 \text{ or } f(3) = 1 \]
  Given \( f(3) > 0 \), we must have:
  \[ f(3) = 1 \]
  Finally, we use the property one last time by setting \( m = 9999 \) and \( n = 0 \):
  \[ f(9999 + 0) - f(9999) - f(0) = 0 \text{ or } 1 \]
  This implies:
  \[ f(9999) - f(9999) - f(0) = 0 \text{ or } 1 \]
  \[ 0 - f(0) = 0 \text{ or } 1 \]
  Solving for \( f(0) \):
  \[ -f(0) = 0 \text{ or } 1 \]
  \[ f(0) = 0 \text{ or } -1 \]
  Since \( f(0) \) must be an integer, we have:
  \[ f(0) = 0 \]
  Given the constraints and the properties of \( f \), we conclude that:
  \[ f(1982) = 660 \]
