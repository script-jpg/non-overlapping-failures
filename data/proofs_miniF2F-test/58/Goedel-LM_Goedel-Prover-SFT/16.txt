  Given the function \( f \) defined on the positive integers and taking non-negative integer values, we know that \( f(2) = 0 \), \( f(3) > 0 \), \( f(9999) = 3333 \), and for all \( m, n \), \( f(m + n) - f(m) - f(n) = 0 \) or \( 1 \). We need to determine \( f(1982) \) and show that it is 660.
  1. From the given conditions, we can derive specific values for \( f \) by considering the function's properties.
  2. Using the properties of \( f \), we can compute \( f(1982) \) by breaking it down into simpler components and applying the given conditions.
  3. Finally, we verify that \( f(1982) = 660 \) by combining the results from the simpler components.
