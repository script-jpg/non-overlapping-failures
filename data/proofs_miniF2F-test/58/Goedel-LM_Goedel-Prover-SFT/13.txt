  To determine \( f(1982) \), we use the given properties of the function \( f \):
  1. \( f(2) = 0 \)
  2. \( f(3) > 0 \)
  3. \( f(9999) = 3333 \)
  4. For all \( m, n \), \( f(m+n) - f(m) - f(n) = 0 \) or \( f(m+n) - f(m) - f(n) = 1 \)
  We need to show that \( f(1982) = 660 \). By applying the properties and solving the resulting equations, we can derive the value of \( f(1982) \).
