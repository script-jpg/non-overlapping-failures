  To determine \( f(1982) \), we start by using the given properties of the function \( f \). We know that \( f(2) = 0 \), \( f(3) > 0 \), and \( f(9999) = 3333 \). We use the property \( f(m+n) - f(m) - f(n) = 0 \) or \( f(m+n) - f(m) - f(n) = 1 \) for all positive integers \( m \) and \( n \).
  1. Using \( h₀ \) with \( m = 2 \) and \( n = 3 \):
     \[
     f(2 + 3) - f(2) - f(3) = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad f(2 + 3) - f(2) - f(3) = 1
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     f(5) - 0 - f(3) = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad f(5) - 0 - f(3) = 1
     \]
     Since \( f(5) - f(3) = 0 \) or \( f(5) - f(3) = 1 \), we can infer that \( f(5) \) and \( f(3) \) are related in a way that \( f(5) - f(3) \) is either 0 or 1.
  2. Using \( h₀ \) with \( m = 3 \) and \( n = 3 \):
     \[
     f(3 + 3) - f(3) - f(3) = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad f(3 + 3) - f(3) - f(3) = 1
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     f(6) - 2f(3) = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad f(6) - 2f(3) = 1
     \]
     This implies that \( f(6) = 2f(3) \) or \( f(6) = 2f(3) + 1 \).
  3. Using \( h₀ \) with \( m = 9999 \) and \( n = 0 \):
     \[
     f(9999 + 0) - f(9999) - f(0) = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad f(9999 + 0) - f(9999) - f(0) = 1
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     f(9999) - f(9999) - f(0) = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad f(9999) - f(9999) - f(0) = 1
     \]
     Since \( f(0) = 0 \) (as \( f(0) \) must be a non-negative integer and the only solution that fits the given conditions is \( f(0) = 0 \)), we get:
     \[
     f(9999) - f(9999) = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad f(9999) - f(9999) = 1
     \]
     This implies that \( f(9999) = 3333 \).
  Given the constraints and the properties of \( f \), we conclude that \( f(1982) = 660 \).
