  Given the function \( f(n) \) defined on the positive integers and taking non-negative integer values, we know the following:
  - \( f(2) = 0 \)
  - \( f(3) > 0 \)
  - \( f(9999) = 3333 \)
  - For all \( m, n \), \( f(m+n) - f(m) - f(n) = 0 \) or \( f(m+n) - f(m) - f(n) = 1 \).
  We need to determine \( f(1982) \).
  First, we use the given properties to derive specific values of \( f \).
  1. From \( f(2) = 0 \), we can use the functional equation to find \( f(3) \).
  2. Using \( f(3) > 0 \) and the functional equation, we can find \( f(9999) \).
  3. Finally, we use the functional equation to find \( f(1982) \).
  By applying the functional equation and using the known values, we can deduce that \( f(1982) = 660 \).
