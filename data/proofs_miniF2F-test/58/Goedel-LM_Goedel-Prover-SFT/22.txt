  To determine \( f(1982) \), we need to analyze the given properties of the function \( f(n) \). The function \( f(n) \) is defined on the positive integers and takes non-negative integer values. We know the following:
  - \( f(2) = 0 \)
  - \( f(3) > 0 \)
  - \( f(9999) = 3333 \)
  - For all \( m, n \): \( f(m+n) - f(m) - f(n) = 0 \) or \( 1 \)
  Given these properties, we can derive the value of \( f(1982) \) by considering the constraints and the behavior of the function. Specifically, we can use the properties to establish a system of equations and solve for \( f(1982) \).
