  Given the function \( f(n) \) defined on the positive integers and taking non-negative integer values, we know that \( f(2) = 0 \), \( f(3) > 0 \), and \( f(9999) = 3333 \). Additionally, for all \( m, n \), we have the property that \( f(m+n) - f(m) - f(n) = 0 \) or \( f(m+n) - f(m) - f(n) = 1 \). We need to determine \( f(1982) \) and show that it is 660.
