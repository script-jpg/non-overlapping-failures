  To determine \( f(1982) \), we start by analyzing the given conditions and properties of the function \( f \). The function \( f \) is defined on the positive integers and takes non-negative integer values. We know that \( f(2) = 0 \), \( f(3) > 0 \), \( f(9999) = 3333 \), and for all \( m, n \):
  \[ f(m+n) - f(m) - f(n) = 0 \text{ or } 1. \]
  Given these conditions, we can use the properties of \( f \) to derive the value of \( f(1982) \).
  First, we use the property \( f(m+n) - f(m) - f(n) = 0 \) or \( f(m+n) - f(m) - f(n) = 1 \) to simplify and derive the value of \( f(1982) \).
