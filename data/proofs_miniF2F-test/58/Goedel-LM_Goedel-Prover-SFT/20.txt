  To determine \( f(1982) \), we start by analyzing the given properties of the function \( f \). We know that \( f(n) \) is defined on the positive integers and takes non-negative integer values. Additionally, we have the following conditions:
  - \( f(2) = 0 \)
  - \( f(3) > 0 \)
  - \( f(9999) = 3333 \)
  - For all \( m \) and \( n \), \( f(m+n) - f(m) - f(n) = 0 \) or \( f(m+n) - f(m) - f(n) = 1 \).
  Using these conditions, we can derive the value of \( f(1982) \).
