  Given the function \( f \) defined on the positive integers and taking non-negative integer values, we know that \( f(2) = 0 \), \( f(3) > 0 \), \( f(9999) = 3333 \), and for all \( m, n \), \( f(m+n) - f(m) - f(n) = 0 \) or \( 1 \). We need to determine \( f(1982) \) and show that it is 660.
  1. Start by evaluating the given properties at specific points to derive useful equalities.
  2. Use the properties derived from specific values to generalize and find the value of \( f(1982) \).
