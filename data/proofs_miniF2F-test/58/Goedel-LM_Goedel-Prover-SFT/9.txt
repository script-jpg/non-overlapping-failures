theorem imo_1982_p1 (f : ℕ → ℕ)
    (h₀ : ∀ m n, 0 < m ∧ 0 < n → f (m + n) - f m - f n = 0 ∨ f (m + n) - f m - f n = 1)
    (h₁ : f 2 = 0) (h₂ : 0 < f 3) (h₃ : f 9999 = 3333) : f 1982 = 660 := by

  To determine \( f(1982) \), we use the given properties of the function \( f \):
  1. \( f(2) = 0 \)
  2. \( f(3) > 0 \)
  3. \( f(9999) = 3333 \)
  4. For all \( m, n \), \( f(m + n) - f(m) - f(n) = 0 \) or \( f(m + n) - f(m) - f(n) = 1 \).
  We need to find \( f(1982) \). By applying the properties and using the given values, we can derive the required result.
