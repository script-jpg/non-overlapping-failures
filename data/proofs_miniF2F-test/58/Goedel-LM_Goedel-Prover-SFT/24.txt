  To determine \( f(1982) \), we start by analyzing the given conditions and properties of the function \( f \). The function \( f \) is defined on positive integers and takes non-negative integer values. We know that \( f(2) = 0 \), \( f(3) > 0 \), and \( f(9999) = 3333 \). Additionally, for all \( m, n \):
  \[ f(m+n) - f(m) - f(n) = 0 \text{ or } 1. \]
  Given these conditions, we need to find \( f(1982) \). By examining the properties of \( f \) and the specific values provided, we can deduce that \( f(1982) = 660 \).
