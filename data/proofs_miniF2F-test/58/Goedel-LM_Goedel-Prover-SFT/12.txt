  Given the function \( f(n) \) defined on the positive integers and taking non-negative integer values, we know the following:
  - \( f(2) = 0 \)
  - \( f(3) > 0 \)
  - \( f(9999) = 3333 \)
  - For all \( m, n \), \( f(m+n) - f(m) - f(n) = 0 \) or \( f(m+n) - f(m) - f(n) = 1 \).
  We need to determine \( f(1982) \) and show that it is 660.
