  To determine \( f(1982) \), we start by analyzing the given conditions and the properties of the function \( f \). We know that \( f(2) = 0 \), \( f(3) > 0 \), and \( f(9999) = 3333 \). The function \( f \) satisfies the condition \( f(m+n) - f(m) - f(n) = 0 \) or \( f(m+n) - f(m) - f(n) = 1 \) for all positive integers \( m \) and \( n \).
  Given these conditions, we can use the properties of \( f \) to derive the value of \( f(1982) \). By applying the conditions and solving the resulting equations, we find that \( f(1982) = 660 \).
