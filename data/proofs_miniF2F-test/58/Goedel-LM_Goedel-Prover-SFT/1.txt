  To determine \( f(1982) \), we use the given properties of the function \( f \):
  1. \( f(2) = 0 \)
  2. \( f(3) > 0 \)
  3. \( f(9999) = 3333 \)
  We are also given that for all \( m, n \):
  \[ f(m + n) - f(m) - f(n) = 0 \text{ or } 1 \]
  We need to find \( f(1982) \). By applying the given properties and using the fact that \( f \) is a non-negative integer function, we can deduce that \( f(1982) = 660 \).
