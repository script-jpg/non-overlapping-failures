  Given the function \( f(n) \) defined on the positive integers and taking non-negative integer values, we know that \( f(2) = 0 \), \( f(3) > 0 \), \( f(9999) = 3333 \), and for all \( m, n \):
  \[ f(m+n) - f(m) - f(n) = 0 \text{ or } 1. \]
  We need to determine \( f(1982) \) and show that it is 660.
