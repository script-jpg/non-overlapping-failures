  We need to determine \( f(4, 1981) \) given the following properties of the function \( f(x, y) \):
  1. \( f(0, y) = y + 1 \)
  2. \( f(x + 1, 0) = f(x, 1) \)
  3. \( f(x + 1, y + 1) = f(x, f(x + 1, y)) \)
  for all non-negative integers \( x \) and \( y \).
  First, we use the properties to compute \( f(4, 1981) \).
  1. Using property (1), \( f(0, 1981) = 1981 + 1 = 1982 \).
  2. Using property (2), \( f(1, 0) = f(0, 1) \).
  3. Using property (3), we can compute \( f(1, 1) \) and \( f(2, 1) \).
  By iteratively applying these properties, we can derive the value of \( f(4, 1981) \).
