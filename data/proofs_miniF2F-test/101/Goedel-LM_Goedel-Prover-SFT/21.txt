  We need to determine the function \( f(4, 1981) \) given the following properties:
  1. \( f(0, y) = y + 1 \)
  2. \( f(x + 1, 0) = f(x, 1) \)
  3. \( f(x + 1, y + 1) = f(x, f(x + 1, y)) \)
  We will use these properties to derive the value of \( f(4, 1981) \).

  -- Using the properties h₀, h₁, and h₂, we derive the value of f(4, y)
  have h₃ := h₂ 0 0
  have h₄ := h₂ 1 0
  have h₅ := h₂ 0 1
  have h₆ := h₂ 1 1
  have h₇ := h₂ 2 0
  have h₈ := h₂ 0 2
  have h₉ := h₂ 1 2
  have h₁₀ := h₂ 2 1
  have h₁₁ := h₂ 2 2
  -- Simplify the derived equations using h₀ and h₁
  simp_all [h₀, h₁]
  -- Use the omega tactic to solve the resulting equations
