  We need to determine \( f(4, 1981) \) given the function \( f(x, y) \) satisfies the following conditions:
  1. \( f(0, y) = y + 1 \) for all \( y \),
  2. \( f(x + 1, 0) = f(x, 1) \) for all \( x \),
  3. \( f(x + 1, y + 1) = f(x, f(x + 1, y)) \) for all non-negative integers \( x \) and \( y \).
  We aim to show that \( f(4, 1981) = 2^{f(4, 1980) + 3} - 3 \).
