  Given the function \( f(x, y) \) satisfies the following conditions:
  1. \( f(0, y) = y + 1 \)
  2. \( f(x + 1, 0) = f(x, 1) \)
  3. \( f(x + 1, y + 1) = f(x, f(x + 1, y)) \)
  for all non-negative integers \( x, y \). We need to determine \( f(4, 1981) \).
  From the conditions, we can derive:
  - \( f(1, 0) = f(0, 1) \) by setting \( x = 0 \) in the second condition.
  - \( f(1, 1) = f(0, f(1, 0)) \) by setting \( x = 1 \) in the third condition.
  - \( f(2, 0) = f(1, 1) \) by setting \( y = 0 \) in the first condition.
  - \( f(0, 2) = f(0, 1) \) by setting \( y = 1 \) in the first condition.
  - \( f(2, 1) = f(1, f(2, 0)) \) by setting \( x = 1 \) in the third condition.
  - \( f(1, 2) = f(0, f(1, 1)) \) by setting \( y = 1 \) in the third condition.
  - \( f(3, 0) = f(2, 1) \) by setting \( x = 2 \) in the second condition.
  - \( f(0, 3) = f(0, 2) \) by setting \( y = 2 \) in the first condition.
  - \( f(3, 1) = f(2, f(3, 0)) \) by setting \( x = 2 \) in the third condition.
  - \( f(2, 3) = f(1, f(2, 2)) \) by setting \( y = 2 \) in the third condition.
  - \( f(4, 0) = f(3, 1) \) by setting \( x = 3 \) in the second condition.
  - \( f(0, 4) = f(0, 3) \) by setting \( y = 3 \) in the first condition.
  Using these conditions, we can compute \( f(4, 1981) \) by iteratively applying the conditions and simplifying the expressions.
