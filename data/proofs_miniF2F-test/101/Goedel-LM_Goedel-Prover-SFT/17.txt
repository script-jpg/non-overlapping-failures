  To determine \( f(4, 1981) \) for the function \( f \) defined by the conditions:
  1. \( f(0, y) = y + 1 \)
  2. \( f(x + 1, 0) = f(x, 1) \)
  3. \( f(x + 1, y + 1) = f(x, f(x + 1, y)) \)
  we need to compute \( f(4, 1981) \). Given the recursive nature of \( f \), we can use the provided conditions to derive a general form for \( f(x, y) \).
  First, we use the conditions to compute the values of \( f \) for small \( x \) and \( y \). By applying the recursive conditions, we can derive a pattern that simplifies to a specific value for \( f(4, 1981) \).
