  We need to determine the function \( f(x, y) \) defined by the conditions:
  1. \( f(0, y) = y + 1 \)
  2. \( f(x + 1, 0) = f(x, 1) \)
  3. \( f(x + 1, y + 1) = f(x, f(x + 1, y)) \)
  for all non-negative integers \( x \) and \( y \). We aim to find \( f(4, 1981) \).
  First, we use the conditions to compute the values of \( f \) for specific values of \( x \) and \( y \). By repeatedly applying the conditions, we derive the value of \( f(4, 1981) \).
