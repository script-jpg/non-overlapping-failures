  We need to determine the function \( f(x, y) \) that satisfies the following conditions for all non-negative integers \( x \) and \( y \):
  1. \( f(0, y) = y + 1 \)
  2. \( f(x + 1, 0) = f(x, 1) \)
  3. \( f(x + 1, y + 1) = f(x, f(x + 1, y)) \)
  We aim to determine \( f(4, 1981) \).
  First, we use the given conditions to derive specific values for \( f \).
  1. From \( f(0, y) = y + 1 \), we have \( f(0, 0) = 1 \).
  2. From \( f(x + 1, 0) = f(x, 1) \), we can infer values for \( f \) at certain points.
  3. From \( f(x + 1, y + 1) = f(x, f(x + 1, y)) \), we can derive recursive values for \( f \).
  Using these conditions, we compute \( f(4, 1981) \) step by step.
