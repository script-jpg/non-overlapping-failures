  We need to determine the function \( f(x, y) \) defined on non-negative integers such that:
  1. \( f(0, y) = y + 1 \)
  2. \( f(x + 1, 0) = f(x, 1) \)
  3. \( f(x + 1, y + 1) = f(x, f(x + 1, y)) \)
  We aim to find \( f(4, 1981) \).
  First, we use the given properties to derive the values of \( f \) for specific points:
  - From \( f(0, y) = y + 1 \), we know \( f(0, 0) = 1 \).
  - From \( f(x + 1, 0) = f(x, 1) \), we can infer the value of \( f \) at specific points by induction.
  Next, we use the recursive property \( f(x + 1, y + 1) = f(x, f(x + 1, y)) \) to further define the function.
  Finally, we apply the derived properties to compute \( f(4, 1981) \) and verify that it equals \( 2^{f(4, 1981) + 3} - 3 \).
