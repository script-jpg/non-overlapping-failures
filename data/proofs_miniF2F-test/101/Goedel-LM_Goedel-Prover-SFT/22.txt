  We need to determine the function \( f(4, y) \) given the following properties:
  1. \( f(0, y) = y + 1 \)
  2. \( f(x + 1, 0) = f(x, 1) \)
  3. \( f(x + 1, y + 1) = f(x, f(x + 1, y)) \)
  We will use these properties to compute \( f(4, y) \) step by step.
  First, we use property (1) to find \( f(0, y) \). Then, we use property (2) to find \( f(x + 1, 0) \). Finally, we use property (3) to find \( f(x + 1, y + 1) \).

  -- Use property (1) to find f(0, y)
  have h₃ := h₀ y
  -- Use property (2) to find f(x + 1, 0)
  have h₄ := h₁ 0
  -- Use property (3) to find f(x + 1, y + 1)
  have h₅ := h₂ 0 0
  -- Simplify the expressions using the properties
