  To determine \( f(4, 1981) \), we use the properties of the function \( f \):
  1. \( f(0, y) = y + 1 \)
  2. \( f(x + 1, 0) = f(x, 1) \)
  3. \( f(x + 1, y + 1) = f(x, f(x + 1, y)) \)
  We need to compute \( f(4, 1981) \). Given the recursive nature of \( f \), we can use these properties to simplify the computation.
  First, we compute the values of \( f \) for the first few \( x \) and \( y \). Using the properties, we find that:
  \[ f(1, 1) = f(0, f(1, 0)) = f(0, 1) = 2 \]
  \[ f(2, 1) = f(1, f(2, 0)) = f(1, 1) = 2 \]
  \[ f(3, 1) = f(2, f(3, 0)) = f(2, 1) = 2 \]
  \[ f(4, 1) = f(3, f(4, 0)) = f(3, 1) = 2 \]
  Next, we use the property \( f(x + 1, y + 1) = f(x, f(x + 1, y)) \) to simplify the computation. We find that:
  \[ f(4, 1981) = f(4, 1980) + 1 \]
  \[ f(4, 1980) = f(3, f(4, 1979)) \]
  \[ f(4, 1979) = f(3, f(4, 1978)) \]
  \[ f(4, 1978) = f(3, f(4, 1977)) \]
  \[ f(4, 1977) = f(3, f(4, 1976)) \]
  \[ f(4, 1976) = f(3, f(4, 1975)) \]
  \[ f(4, 1975) = f(3, f(4, 1974)) \]
  \[ f(4, 1974) = f(3, f(4, 1973)) \]
  \[ f(4, 1973) = f(3, f(4, 1972)) \]
  \[ f(4, 1972) = f(3, f(4, 1971)) \]
  Finally, we compute the value of \( f(4, 1981) \) using the properties and the computed values.
