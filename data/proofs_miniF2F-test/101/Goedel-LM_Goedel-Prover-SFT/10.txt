  To determine \( f(4, 1981) \), we use the properties of the function \( f \) given by:
  1. \( f(0, y) = y + 1 \)
  2. \( f(x + 1, 0) = f(x, 1) \)
  3. \( f(x + 1, y + 1) = f(x, f(x + 1, y)) \)
  We need to show that \( f(4, 1981) = 2^{f(4, 1980) + 3} - 3 \).
  First, we compute \( f(4, 0) \):
  \[ f(4, 0) = f(3, f(4, -1)) = f(3, f(4, 0)) = 2^{f(3, f(4, 0)) + 3} - 3 \]
  Next, we compute \( f(4, 1) \):
  \[ f(4, 1) = f(3, f(4, 0)) = f(3, f(4, 0)) = 2^{f(3, f(4, 0)) + 3} - 3 \]
  By induction, we can show that \( f(4, y) = 2^{f(4, y + 1) + 3} - 3 \).
  Finally, we verify that \( f(4, 1981) = 2^{f(4, 1980) + 3} - 3 \).
