  We need to show that for the function \( f(x, y) \) defined by the given properties, \( f(4, 1981) = 2^{f(4, 1980) + 3} - 3 \).
  1. Start by applying the third property \( f(x+1, y+1) = f(x, f(x+1, y)) \) to derive the value of \( f(4, 1981) \).
  2. Use the first and second properties to compute \( f(4, 1980) \).
  3. Substitute these values into the expression derived from the third property.
  4. Simplify the resulting expression to confirm the given equality.
