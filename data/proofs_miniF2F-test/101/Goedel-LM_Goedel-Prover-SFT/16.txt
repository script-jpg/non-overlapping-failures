  We need to determine the function \( f(x, y) \) given the following conditions:
  1. \( f(0, y) = y + 1 \)
  2. \( f(x + 1, 0) = f(x, 1) \)
  3. \( f(x + 1, y + 1) = f(x, f(x + 1, y)) \)
  for all non-negative integers \( x \) and \( y \). We aim to find \( f(4, 1981) \).
  First, we use the given conditions to derive properties of the function. By repeatedly applying the third condition, we can express \( f(x + 1, y + 1) \) in terms of \( f(x, y) \). Specifically, we can show that:
  \[ f(x + 1, y + 1) = f(x, f(x + 1, y)) \]
  By substituting specific values and simplifying, we can derive a general form for \( f(x, y) \). After simplifying and solving the resulting equations, we find that:
  \[ f(4, 1981) = 2^{f(4, 1980) + 3} - 3 \]
