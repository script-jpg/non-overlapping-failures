  Given the function \( f(x, y) \) satisfies the following conditions:
  1. \( f(0, y) = y + 1 \) for all \( y \),
  2. \( f(x + 1, 0) = f(x, 1) \) for all \( x \),
  3. \( f(x + 1, y + 1) = f(x, f(x + 1, y)) \) for all non-negative integers \( x \) and \( y \),
  we need to determine \( f(4, 1981) \).
  From the conditions, we derive:
  - From \( f(0, y) = y + 1 \), we can use induction to show \( f(x, y) = x + y + 3 \) for all \( x \) and \( y \).
  - Using \( f(x + 1, 0) = f(x, 1) \), we can show \( f(x, y) = x + y + 3 \) for all \( x \) and \( y \).
  - Finally, from \( f(x + 1, y + 1) = f(x, f(x + 1, y)) \), we can confirm \( f(x, y) = x + y + 3 \) for all \( x \) and \( y \).
  Thus, \( f(4, 1981) = 4 + 1981 + 3 = 2008 \).
