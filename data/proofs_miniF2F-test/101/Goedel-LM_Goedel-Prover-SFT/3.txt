  We need to determine \( f(4, 1981) \) given the function \( f \) satisfies the following conditions:
  1. \( f(0, y) = y + 1 \)
  2. \( f(x + 1, 0) = f(x, 1) \)
  3. \( f(x + 1, y + 1) = f(x, f(x + 1, y)) \)
  We will show that \( f(4, y + 1) = 2^{f(4, y) + 3} - 3 \) for all non-negative integers \( y \).

  -- Apply the given conditions to derive the required form of f(4, y + 1).
  have h₃ := h₂ 3 y
  have h₄ := h₂ 4 y
  have h₅ := h₂ 0 y
  have h₆ := h₂ 1 y
  have h₇ := h₂ 2 y
  have h₈ := h₂ 3 y
  have h₉ := h₂ 4 y
  -- Simplify the expressions using the given conditions and properties of f.
