  To determine \( f(4, 1981) \), we will use the given properties of the function \( f \):
  1. \( f(0, y) = y + 1 \)
  2. \( f(x + 1, 0) = f(x, 1) \)
  3. \( f(x + 1, y + 1) = f(x, f(x + 1, y)) \)
  We will compute the values of \( f \) step by step using these properties and determine \( f(4, 1981) \).
