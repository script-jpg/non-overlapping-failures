  To determine the function \( f(x, y) \) for all non-negative integers \( x \) and \( y \), we start by analyzing the given properties:
  1. \( f(0, y) = y + 1 \)
  2. \( f(x + 1, 0) = f(x, 1) \)
  3. \( f(x + 1, y + 1) = f(x, f(x + 1, y)) \)
  Given these properties, we need to find \( f(4, 1981) \).
  First, we use the properties to derive specific values of \( f \):
  - From \( f(0, y) = y + 1 \), we know \( f(0, y) = y + 1 \).
  - From \( f(x + 1, 0) = f(x, 1) \), we can derive specific values for \( f \) at certain points.
  - From \( f(x + 1, y + 1) = f(x, f(x + 1, y)) \), we can derive a recursive relation.
  Using these properties, we can compute \( f(4, 1981) \) by iteratively applying the recursive relation and simplifying.
