  To determine \( f(4, 1981) \) given the function \( f \) satisfies the following conditions:
  1. \( f(0, y) = y + 1 \) for all \( y \),
  2. \( f(x + 1, 0) = f(x, 1) \) for all \( x \),
  3. \( f(x + 1, y + 1) = f(x, f(x + 1, y)) \) for all \( x, y \),
  we need to compute \( f(4, 1981) \).
  First, we use the given conditions to derive specific values of \( f \):
  - From \( f(0, y) = y + 1 \), we have \( f(0, 0) = 1 \).
  - From \( f(x + 1, 0) = f(x, 1) \), we have \( f(1, 0) = 1 \).
  - From \( f(x + 1, y + 1) = f(x, f(x + 1, y)) \), we can derive the recursive relation.
  Using these conditions, we can compute \( f(4, 1981) \) by iteratively applying the recursive relation and simplifying.
