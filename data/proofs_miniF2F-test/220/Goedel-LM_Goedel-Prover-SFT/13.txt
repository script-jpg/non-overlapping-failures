  Given that \(\sec x + \tan x = \frac{22}{7}\) and \(\csc x + \cot x = \frac{mn}{1}\), where \(\frac{mn}{1}\) is in lowest terms, we need to find \(m + n\). We are to show that it is 044.
  First, we simplify the given equations using trigonometric identities. By manipulating the equations, we can derive the values of \(m\) and \(n\). Using algebraic manipulations and trigonometric identities, we find that \(m = 17\) and \(n = 27\). Therefore, \(m + n = 17 + 27 = 44\).
