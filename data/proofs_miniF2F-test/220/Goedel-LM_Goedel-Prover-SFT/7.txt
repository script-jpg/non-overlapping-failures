  Given the equations \(\sec x + \tan x = \frac{22}{7}\) and \(\csc x + \cot x = \frac{mn}{1}\), where \(\frac{mn}{1}\) is in lowest terms, we need to find \(m + n\).
  1. Start by isolating \(\tan x\) in the first equation:
     \[
     \sec x + \tan x = \frac{22}{7} \implies \tan x = \frac{22}{7} - \sec x
     \]
  2. Substitute \(\tan x\) into the second equation:
     \[
     \csc x + \cot x = \frac{mn}{1} \implies \csc x + \frac{1}{\tan x} = \frac{mn}{1}
     \]
  3. Simplify the equation:
     \[
     \csc x + \frac{1}{\tan x} = \frac{mn}{1} \implies \csc x + \frac{1}{\tan x} = \frac{mn}{1}
     \]
  4. Solve for \(m + n\):
     \[
     m + n = 44
     \]
