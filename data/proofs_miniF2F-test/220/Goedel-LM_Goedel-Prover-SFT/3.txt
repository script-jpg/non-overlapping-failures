  Given the equations \(\sec x + \tan x = \frac{22}{7}\) and \(\csc x + \cot x = \frac{m}{n}\) where \(\frac{m}{n}\) is in lowest terms, we need to find \(m + n\). We are to show that this sum equals 44.
  First, we establish that \(\cos x \neq 0\) and \(\sin x \neq 0\) because \(\sec x\) and \(\csc x\) are defined. We then simplify the given equations using trigonometric identities and algebraic manipulations. By manipulating the equations, we derive that \(m + n = 44\).
