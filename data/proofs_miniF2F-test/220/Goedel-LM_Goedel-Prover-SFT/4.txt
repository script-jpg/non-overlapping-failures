  Given that \(\sec x + \tan x = \frac{22}{7}\) and that \(\csc x + \cot x = \frac{mn}{n}\), where \(\frac{mn}{n}\) is in lowest terms, we need to find \(m + n\). We are to show that \(m + n = 44\).
  1. Start by expressing \(\sec x\) and \(\tan x\) in terms of \(\cos x\) and \(\sin x\).
  2. Substitute these expressions into the given equations.
  3. Simplify the equations using algebraic manipulations.
  4. Solve the resulting system of equations to find the values of \(m\) and \(n\).
  5. Verify that \(m + n = 44\).
