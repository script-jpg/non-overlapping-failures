  Given that \(\sec x + \tan x = \frac{22}{7}\) and \(\csc x + \cot x = \frac{mn}{n}\) where \(\frac{mn}{n}\) is in its lowest terms, we need to find \(m + n\). We are to show that \(m + n = 44\).
  1. Start by simplifying the given equations using trigonometric identities and algebraic manipulations.
  2. Use the identity \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\) and \(\tan x = \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) to rewrite the first equation.
  3. Simplify the second equation using the identity \(\csc x = \frac{1}{\sin x}\) and \(\cot x = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\).
  4. Normalize the expressions and simplify using algebraic operations.
  5. Solve the resulting equations to find the values of \(m\) and \(n\).
  6. Verify that \(m + n = 44\).
