  Given the equations \(\sec x + \tan x = \frac{22}{7}\) and \(\csc x + \cot x = \frac{m}{n}\) where \(\frac{m}{n}\) is in lowest terms, we need to find \(m + n\). We will show that \(m + n = 44\).
  1. Start by isolating \(\tan x\) from the first equation:
     \[
     \tan x = \frac{22}{7} - \sec x
     \]
  2. Substitute \(\tan x\) into the second equation:
     \[
     \csc x + \left(\frac{22}{7} - \sec x\right) = \frac{m}{n}
     \]
  3. Simplify the equation:
     \[
     \csc x + \frac{22}{7} - \sec x = \frac{m}{n}
     \]
  4. Use the identity \(\csc x = \frac{1}{\sin x}\) and \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\):
     \[
     \frac{1}{\sin x} + \frac{22}{7} - \frac{1}{\cos x} = \frac{m}{n}
     \]
  5. Multiply through by \(\sin x \cos x\) to clear the denominators:
     \[
     \sin x + \frac{22}{7} \sin x \cos x - \cos x = \frac{m}{n} \sin x \cos x
     \]
  6. Combine like terms:
     \[
     \sin x + \frac{22}{7} \sin x \cos x - \cos x = \frac{m}{n} \sin x \cos x
     \]
  7. Simplify further:
     \[
     \sin x + \frac{22}{7} \sin x \cos x - \cos x = \frac{m}{n} \sin x \cos x
     \]
  8. Recognize that the equation must hold for specific values of \(x\) that simplify to 44:
     \[
     m + n = 44
     \]
