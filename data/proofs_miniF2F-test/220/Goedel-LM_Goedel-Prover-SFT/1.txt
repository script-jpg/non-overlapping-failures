  Given that \(\sec x + \tan x = \frac{22}{7}\) and that \(\csc x + \cot x = \frac{m}{n}\), where \(\frac{m}{n}\) is in lowest terms, we need to find \(m + n\). We are to show that \(m + n = 44\).
  1. Start by expressing the given conditions in terms of trigonometric identities.
  2. Use the identity \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\) and \(\tan x = \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) to rewrite the first condition.
  3. Use the identity \(\csc x = \frac{1}{\sin x}\) and \(\cot x = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\) to rewrite the second condition.
  4. Simplify the expressions using algebraic manipulations.
  5. Solve the resulting equations to find the values of \(m\) and \(n\).
  6. Verify that \(m + n = 44\).
