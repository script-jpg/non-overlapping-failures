  Given that \(\sec x + \tan x = \frac{22}{7}\) and \(\csc x + \cot x = \frac{m}{n}\) where \(\frac{m}{n}\) is in lowest terms, we need to find \(m + n\). We are to show that \(m + n = 44\).
  1. Start by simplifying the given equations using trigonometric identities and algebraic manipulations.
  2. Use the fact that \(\sec x + \tan x = \frac{22}{7}\) to derive a relationship involving \(\cos x\) and \(\sin x\).
  3. Use the fact that \(\csc x + \cot x = \frac{m}{n}\) to derive a relationship involving \(\cos x\) and \(\sin x\).
  4. Combine the derived relationships to solve for \(m\) and \(n\).
  5. Verify that \(m + n = 44\).
