  Given that \(\sec x + \tan x = \frac{22}{7}\) and \(\csc x + \cot x = \frac{m}{n}\), where \(\frac{m}{n}\) is in lowest terms, we need to find \(m + n\). We are to show that \(m + n = 44\).
  1. Start by simplifying the given equations using trigonometric identities.
  2. Use the identity for \(\sec x\) and \(\tan x\) to rewrite the first equation.
  3. Use the identity for \(\csc x\) and \(\cot x\) to rewrite the second equation.
  4. Solve the resulting equations step by step to find the values of \(m\) and \(n\).
  5. Verify that the sum \(m + n\) equals 44.
