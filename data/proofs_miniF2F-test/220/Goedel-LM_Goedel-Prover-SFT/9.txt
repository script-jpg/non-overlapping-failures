  Given \(\sec x + \tan x = \frac{22}{7}\) and \(\csc x + \cot x = \frac{mn}{n}\), where \(\frac{mn}{n}\) is in lowest terms, we need to find \(m + n\). We are to show that \(m + n = 44\).
  First, we establish that \(\cos x \neq 0\) and \(\sin x \neq 0\) to avoid division by zero. Using the given equations, we simplify and solve for \(m\) and \(n\). By manipulating the equations algebraically and using trigonometric identities, we derive that \(m + n = 44\).
