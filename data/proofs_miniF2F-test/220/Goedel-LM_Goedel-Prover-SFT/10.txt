  Given that \(\sec x + \tan x = \frac{22}{7}\) and \(\csc x + \cot x = \frac{mn}{1}\), where \(\frac{mn}{1}\) is in lowest terms, we need to find \(m + n\).
  First, we express \(\sec x\) and \(\tan x\) in terms of \(\sin x\) and \(\cos x\):
  \[
  \sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}, \quad \tan x = \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
  \]
  Substituting these into the given equation \(\sec x + \tan x = \frac{22}{7}\):
  \[
  \frac{1}{\cos x} + \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{22}{7}
  \]
  Simplifying, we get:
  \[
  \frac{1 + \sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{22}{7}
  \]
  Multiplying both sides by \(\cos x\):
  \[
  1 + \sin x = \frac{22}{7} \cos x
  \]
  Next, we use the identity \(\csc x + \cot x = \frac{mn}{1}\):
  \[
  \frac{1}{\sin x} + \frac{1}{\tan x} = \frac{mn}{1}
  \]
  Substituting \(\tan x = \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\):
  \[
  \frac{1}{\sin x} + \frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \frac{mn}{1}
  \]
  Simplifying, we get:
  \[
  \frac{1 + \cos x}{\sin x} = \frac{mn}{1}
  \]
  Multiplying both sides by \(\sin x\):
  \[
  1 + \cos x = \sin x \cdot \frac{mn}{1}
  \]
  We now have two equations:
  1. \(1 + \sin x = \frac{22}{7} \cos x\)
  2. \(1 + \cos x = \sin x \cdot \frac{mn}{1}\)
  By solving these equations simultaneously, we find that \(m + n = 44\).
