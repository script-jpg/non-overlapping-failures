  Given that \(\sec x + \tan x = \frac{22}{7}\) and \(\csc x + \cot x = \frac{m}{n}\) where \(\frac{m}{n}\) is in lowest terms, we need to find \(m + n\). We are to show that \(m + n = 44\).
  1. Start by simplifying the given equations using trigonometric identities and algebraic manipulations.
  2. Use the identity \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\) and \(\tan x = \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) to rewrite the first equation.
  3. Simplify the second equation using the identity \(\csc x = \frac{1}{\sin x}\) and \(\cot x = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\).
  4. Solve the resulting system of equations to find the values of \(\sin x\) and \(\cos x\).
  5. Use the values of \(\sin x\) and \(\cos x\) to compute \(m\) and \(n\) and verify that \(m + n = 44\).
