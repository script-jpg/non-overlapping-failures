  Given that \(\sec x + \tan x = \frac{22}{7}\) and \(\csc x + \cot x = \frac{m}{n}\), where \(\frac{m}{n}\) is in lowest terms, we need to find \(m + n\).
  1. Start by expressing the given equations in terms of trigonometric functions.
  2. Use the given equations to solve for \(m\) and \(n\).
  3. Substitute the values of \(m\) and \(n\) into the expression \(m + n\).
  4. Simplify the expression to verify that \(m + n = 44\).
