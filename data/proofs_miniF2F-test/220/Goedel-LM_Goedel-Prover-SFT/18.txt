  Given the equations \(\sec x + \tan x = \frac{22}{7}\) and \(\csc x + \cot x = \frac{m}{n}\), where \(\frac{m}{n}\) is in lowest terms, we need to find \(m + n\). We are to show that \(m + n = 044\).
  First, we normalize the given equations using numerical simplification. Then, we use algebraic manipulation and simplification to derive the values of \(m\) and \(n\). Finally, we verify that \(m + n = 44\).
