  Given the equations \(\sec x + \tan x = \frac{22}{7}\) and \(\csc x + \cot x = \frac{m}{n}\) where \(\frac{m}{n}\) is in lowest terms, we need to find \(m + n\). We are to show that \(m + n = 44\).
  1. Start by simplifying the given equations using trigonometric identities.
  2. Use the identity for the sum of secant and tangent: \(\sec x + \tan x = \frac{1}{\cos x} + \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1 + \sin x}{\cos x}\).
  3. Substitute this into the first equation: \(\frac{1 + \sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{22}{7}\).
  4. Solve for \(\sin x\) and \(\cos x\) using the Pythagorean identity \(\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1\).
  5. Use the identity for the sum of cosecant and cotangent: \(\csc x + \cot x = \frac{1}{\sin x} + \frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \frac{1 + \cos x}{\sin x}\).
  6. Substitute this into the second equation: \(\frac{1 + \cos x}{\sin x} = \frac{m}{n}\).
  7. Solve for \(\sin x\) and \(\cos x\) using the Pythagorean identity and the given values of \(\sec x + \tan x\) and \(\csc x + \cot x\).
  8. Verify that the values of \(\sin x\) and \(\cos x\) satisfy the given equations and the Pythagorean identity.
  9. Conclude that \(m + n = 44\).
