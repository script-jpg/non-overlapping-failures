  Given the equations \(\sec x + \tan x = \frac{22}{7}\) and \(\csc x + \cot x = \frac{m}{n}\), where \(\frac{m}{n}\) is in lowest terms, we need to find \(m + n\). We are to show that \(m + n = 44\).
  1. Start by simplifying the given equations using trigonometric identities.
  2. Use algebraic manipulation to express \(\sec x\) and \(\tan x\) in terms of \(\sin x\) and \(\cos x\).
  3. Substitute these expressions into the given equations.
  4. Solve the resulting system of equations to find the values of \(\sin x\) and \(\cos x\).
  5. Use the Pythagorean identity \(\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1\) to further simplify the equations.
  6. Finally, solve for \(m\) and \(n\) and verify that \(m + n = 44\).
