  Given that \(\sec x + \tan x = \frac{22}{7}\) and that \(\csc x + \cot x = \frac{mn}{n}\) where \(\frac{mn}{n}\) is in lowest terms, we need to find \(m + n\) and show that it equals 44.
  1. Start by simplifying the given equations using trigonometric identities and properties.
  2. Use algebraic manipulation to express the equations in a more manageable form.
  3. Substitute and simplify to find the values of \(m\) and \(n\).
  4. Verify that \(m + n = 44\).
