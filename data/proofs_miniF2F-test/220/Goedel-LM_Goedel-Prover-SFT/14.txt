  Given that \(\sec x + \tan x = \frac{22}{7}\) and that \(\csc x + \cot x = \frac{mn}{n}\) in lowest terms, we need to find \(m + n\). We are to show that \(m + n = 44\).
  First, we use the given equations:
  1. \(\sec x + \tan x = \frac{22}{7}\)
  2. \(\csc x + \cot x = \frac{mn}{n}\)
  We start by expressing \(\sec x\) and \(\csc x\) in terms of \(\cos x\) and \(\sin x\):
  \[
  \sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}, \quad \csc x = \frac{1}{\sin x}
  \]
  Substituting these into the given equations, we get:
  1. \(\frac{1}{\cos x} + \tan x = \frac{22}{7}\)
  2. \(\frac{1}{\sin x} + \cot x = \frac{mn}{n}\)
  Next, we simplify the first equation:
  \[
  \frac{1}{\cos x} + \tan x = \frac{22}{7}
  \]
  Multiplying both sides by \(\cos x\) to clear the fraction:
  \[
  1 + \tan^2 x = \frac{22}{7} \cos x
  \]
  Using the identity \(\tan^2 x = \frac{1}{\cos^2 x} - 1\):
  \[
  1 + \left(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} - 1\right) = \frac{22}{7} \cos x
  \]
  Simplifying:
  \[
  \frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = \frac{22}{7} \cos x
  \]
  Multiplying both sides by \(\cos^2 x\):
  \[
  1 = \frac{22}{7} \cos^3 x
  \]
  Solving for \(\cos^3 x\):
  \[
  \cos^3 x = \frac{7}{22}
  \]
  Next, we simplify the second equation:
  \[
  \frac{1}{\sin x} + \cot x = \frac{mn}{n}
  \]
  Multiplying both sides by \(\sin x\) to clear the fraction:
  \[
  1 + \cot x = \frac{mn}{n} \sin x
  \]
  Using the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\):
  \[
  1 + \frac{1}{\tan x} = \frac{mn}{n} \sin x
  \]
  Simplifying:
  \[
  1 + \frac{1}{\tan x} = \frac{mn}{n} \sin x
  \]
  Finally, we solve for \(m\) and \(n\) using the derived equations and the fact that \(\tan x\) and \(\sin x\) are related in a way that the sum of the numerator and denominator of the simplified equations must be consistent with the given values.
