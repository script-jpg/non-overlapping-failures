  Given that \(\sec x + \tan x = \frac{22}{7}\) and \(\csc x + \cot x = \frac{mn}{n}\) where \(\frac{mn}{n}\) is in its lowest terms, we need to find \(m + n\).
  1. Start by simplifying the given equations using trigonometric identities.
  2. Substitute the known values into the equations.
  3. Normalize the expressions to simplify the equations further.
  4. Use algebraic manipulation to find the values of \(m\) and \(n\).
  5. Verify that the sum \(m + n\) equals 44.
