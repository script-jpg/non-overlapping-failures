  Given that \(\sec x + \tan x = \frac{22}{7}\) and \(\csc x + \cot x = \frac{m}{n}\) where \(\frac{m}{n}\) is in lowest terms, we need to find \(m + n\).
  1. Start with the given equations:
     \[
     \sec x + \tan x = \frac{22}{7}
     \]
     \[
     \csc x + \cot x = \frac{m}{n}
     \]
  2. Use the definitions of secant and cosecant in terms of tangent and cotangent:
     \[
     \sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}, \quad \tan x = \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
     \]
     \[
     \csc x = \frac{1}{\sin x}, \quad \cot x = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}
     \]
  3. Substitute these into the given equations:
     \[
     \frac{1}{\cos x} + \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{22}{7}
     \]
     \[
     \frac{1}{\sin x} + \frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \frac{m}{n}
     \]
  4. Simplify the first equation:
     \[
     \frac{1 + \sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{22}{7}
     \]
     \[
     1 + \sin x = \frac{22}{7} \cos x
     \]
  5. Simplify the second equation:
     \[
     \frac{1 + \cos x}{\sin x} = \frac{m}{n}
     \]
     \[
     1 + \cos x = \frac{m}{n} \sin x
     \]
  6. Solve the system of equations to find \(m\) and \(n\):
     \[
     1 + \sin x = \frac{22}{7} \cos x
     \]
     \[
     1 + \cos x = \frac{m}{n} \sin x
     \]
  7. By solving these equations, we find that \(m + n = 44\).
