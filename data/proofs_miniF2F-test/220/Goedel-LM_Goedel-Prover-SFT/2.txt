  Given that \(\sec x + \tan x = \frac{22}{7}\) and that \(\csc x + \cot x = \frac{mn}{1}\) where \(\frac{mn}{1}\) is in lowest terms, we need to find \(m + n\).
  1. Start by simplifying the given equations using trigonometric identities.
  2. Use the identity \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\) and \(\tan x = \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) to rewrite the first equation.
  3. Use the identity \(\csc x = \frac{1}{\sin x}\) and \(\cot x = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\) to rewrite the second equation.
  4. Simplify the equations to isolate terms involving \(\sin x\) and \(\cos x\).
  5. Solve the system of equations to find the values of \(\sin x\) and \(\cos x\).
  6. Use the Pythagorean identity \(\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1\) to find the relationship between \(\sin x\) and \(\cos x\).
  7. Substitute the values of \(\sin x\) and \(\cos x\) back into the expression for \(m + n\).
  8. Verify that \(m + n = 44\).
