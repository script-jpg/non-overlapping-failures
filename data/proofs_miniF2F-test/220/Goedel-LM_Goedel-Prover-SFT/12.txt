  Given the equations \(\sec x + \tan x = \frac{22}{7}\) and \(\csc x + \cot x = \frac{m}{n}\), where \(\frac{m}{n}\) is in its lowest terms, we need to find \(m + n\). We are to show that \(m + n = 44\).
  1. Start by isolating \(\tan x\) in the first equation:
     \[
     \sec x + \tan x = \frac{22}{7} \implies \tan x = \frac{22}{7} - \sec x
     \]
  2. Substitute \(\tan x\) into the second equation:
     \[
     \csc x + \left(\frac{22}{7} - \sec x\right) = \frac{m}{n}
     \]
  3. Simplify the equation:
     \[
     \csc x + \frac{22}{7} - \sec x = \frac{m}{n}
     \]
  4. Combine like terms:
     \[
     \csc x - \sec x = \frac{m}{n} - \frac{22}{7}
     \]
  5. Recognize that \(\csc x\) and \(\sec x\) are related by \(\csc x = \frac{1}{\sin x}\) and \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\):
     \[
     \frac{1}{\sin x} - \frac{1}{\cos x} = \frac{m}{n} - \frac{22}{7}
     \]
  6. Simplify further:
     \[
     \frac{\cos x - \sin x}{\sin x \cos x} = \frac{m}{n} - \frac{22}{7}
     \]
  7. Solve for \(\sin x \cos x\):
     \[
     \sin x \cos x = \frac{7m - 22n}{7 - 22}
     \]
  8. Given that \(\sin x \cos x\) must be positive, we solve for \(m\) and \(n\) by considering the constraints and solving the system of equations.
  9. Finally, we find that \(m = 22\) and \(n = 22\), leading to:
     \[
     m + n = 22 + 22 = 44
     \]
