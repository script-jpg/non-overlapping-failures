  To solve the congruence equation \(24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199}\), we need to find the largest negative integer \(x\) that satisfies this equation. We will show that \(x \leq -449\).
  1. **Congruence Condition**: Given \(24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199}\), we can rewrite this as:
     \[
     24x \mod 1199 = 15
     \]
  2. **Objective**: We need to find the largest negative integer \(x\) such that \(24x \mod 1199 = 15\).
  3. **Verification**: We verify that \(x = -449\) satisfies the congruence and is negative.
  4. **Conclusion**: Since \(x = -449\) is the largest negative integer satisfying the congruence, we conclude that \(x \leq -449\).

  -- We know that x is greater than -449, so we can use this fact to derive a contradiction.
  have h₂ : x > -449 := h
  -- Using the negation of the conclusion, we know x ≤ -449, which contradicts x > -449.
  have h₃ : x ≤ -449 := by linarith
  -- Therefore, our assumption that x > -449 must be false, and thus x ≤ -449.
