  To solve the congruence equation \(24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199}\), we need to find the largest negative integer \(x\) that satisfies this condition. We start by noting that the congruence can be rewritten as \(24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199}\). We then use the properties of modular arithmetic to solve for \(x\). Specifically, we use the fact that \(24\) and \(1199\) are coprime, allowing us to find the modular inverse of \(24\) modulo \(1199\). The modular inverse of \(24\) modulo \(1199\) is \(397\), because \(24 \times 397 \equiv 1 \pmod{1199}\). Multiplying both sides of the congruence \(24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199}\) by \(397\), we get \(x \equiv 15 \times 397 \pmod{1199}\). Simplifying \(15 \times 397\) modulo \(1199\), we find that \(15 \times 397 \equiv 5955 \pmod{1199}\), which simplifies to \(5955 \equiv 595 \pmod{1199}\). Thus, \(x \equiv 595 \pmod{1199}\). Since \(x\) must be negative, the largest negative solution is \(-449\). Therefore, the largest negative integer \(x\) satisfying the congruence is \(-449\).
