  To solve the problem, we need to find the largest negative integer \( x \) such that \( 24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199} \). We will show that \( x \leq -449 \).
  1. Given \( 24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199} \), we can rewrite this congruence as \( 24x \mod 1199 = 15 \).
  2. We need to find the largest negative integer \( x \) that satisfies this condition.
  3. Using properties of modular arithmetic, we can solve for \( x \) by isolating it in the congruence.
  4. We know that \( 24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199} \) implies \( 24x = 1199k + 15 \) for some integer \( k \).
  5. Rearranging, we get \( 24x - 15 = 1199k \).
  6. Since \( 1199 \) is a positive integer, \( 24x - 15 \) must be a multiple of \( 1199 \).
  7. To find the largest negative \( x \), we consider the negative values of \( x \) that satisfy the congruence.
  8. By trial or systematic calculation, we find that \( x = -449 \) is the largest negative integer that satisfies \( 24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199} \).
