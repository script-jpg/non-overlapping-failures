  To solve the congruence \(24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199}\), we need to find the largest negative integer \(x\) that satisfies this condition. We start by simplifying the congruence using properties of modular arithmetic.
  1. Given \(24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199}\), we can express this as:
     \[
     24x = 1199k + 15 \quad \text{for some integer } k
     \]
  2. Rearrange to solve for \(x\):
     \[
     x = \frac{1199k + 15}{24}
     \]
  3. Since \(x\) must be an integer, \(1199k + 15\) must be divisible by 24. We can test values of \(k\) to find the largest negative integer \(x\).
  4. Testing values:
     - For \(k = 0\), \(x = \frac{15}{24} = \frac{5}{8}\)
     - For \(k = 1\), \(x = \frac{1199 + 15}{24} = \frac{1214}{24} = 42.25\)
     - For \(k = -1\), \(x = \frac{1199 - 15}{24} = \frac{1184}{24} = 49.33\)
     - For \(k = -2\), \(x = \frac{1199 - 30}{24} = \frac{1169}{24} = 48.7083\)
  5. The largest negative integer \(x\) that satisfies the congruence is \(-449\).
