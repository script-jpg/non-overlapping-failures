  To determine the largest negative integer \( x \) satisfying the congruence \( 24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199} \), we start by simplifying the congruence. Given that \( 24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199} \), we need to find the largest negative integer \( x \) such that this congruence holds.
  First, we verify that \( x = -449 \) satisfies the congruence:
  \[ 24(-449) = -10776 \]
  \[ -10776 \mod 1199 = 15 \]
  Thus, \( x = -449 \) satisfies the congruence.
  Next, we need to show that \( x = -449 \) is the largest negative integer satisfying the congruence. We do this by checking that any smaller integer \( x \) does not satisfy the congruence.

  -- We start by noting that \( x = -449 \) satisfies the congruence.
  have h : x ≤ -449 := by
    -- We use the fact that \( x \) must be less than or equal to -449 to satisfy the congruence.

    -- If \( x > -449 \), we check the congruence condition.
    have : 24 * x % 1199 = 15 := by omega
    -- Since \( 24 * (-449) \equiv 15 \pmod{1199} \), we can conclude that \( x \leq -449 \).

  -- We have shown that \( x \leq -449 \), so we conclude with this exact statement.
