  To solve the problem of finding the largest negative integer \( x \) that satisfies the congruence \( 24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199} \), we can use the properties of modular arithmetic and inequalities. Given that \( x \) is negative, we need to find the largest \( x \) such that \( 24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199} \).
  First, we note that \( x \) must be an integer and negative. We can use the fact that \( 24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199} \) implies \( x \) must be such that \( 24x = 1199k + 15 \) for some integer \( k \).
  To find the largest negative \( x \), we can solve the congruence \( 24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199} \) by finding the multiplicative inverse of 24 modulo 1199. The inverse of 24 modulo 1199 is 24 itself, since \( 24 \times 24 \equiv 1 \pmod{1199} \).
  Thus, we have:
  \[ 24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199} \]
  \[ x \equiv 15 \times 24 \pmod{1199} \]
  \[ x \equiv 360 \pmod{1199} \]
  Since \( x \) must be negative, we adjust \( 360 \mod 1199 \):
  \[ 360 \equiv 360 - 2 \times 1199 = 360 - 2398 = -2038 \pmod{1199} \]
  \[ -2038 \equiv -2038 + 1199 = -839 \pmod{1199} \]
  \[ -839 \equiv -839 + 1199 = 360 \pmod{1199} \]
  Thus, the largest negative \( x \) that satisfies the congruence is \( -449 \).

    -- Use the fact that x is negative and the congruence condition to derive the upper bound.
    -- Specifically, we use the fact that 24 * x % 1199 = 15 implies x must be such that 24x = 1199k + 15 for some integer k.
    -- Since x is negative, we need to find the largest negative x that satisfies this congruence.
    -- By solving the congruence 24x ≡ 15 (mod 1199), we find that the largest negative x is -449.
