  To solve the congruence equation \(24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199}\) and find the largest negative integer \(x\) that satisfies this condition, we proceed as follows:
  1. **Simplify the congruence**: We start by rewriting \(24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199}\) in a more manageable form.
  2. **Use the properties of modular arithmetic**: We use the fact that \(24 \cdot 5 \equiv 15 \pmod{1199}\) to find a specific solution.
  3. **Apply the general solution**: We then use the general solution to find the largest negative integer \(x\) that satisfies the congruence.
