  To find the largest negative integer \( x \) satisfying \( 24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199} \), we need to solve the congruence equation \( 24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199} \). We start by expressing \( x \) in terms of its remainder when divided by 1199. Specifically, we write \( x \) as \( x = 1199k + r \) where \( r \) is the remainder when \( x \) is divided by 1199.
  Substituting \( x = 1199k + r \) into the congruence \( 24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199} \), we get:
  \[ 24(1199k + r) \equiv 15 \pmod{1199} \]
  Expanding and simplifying this congruence:
  \[ 24 \cdot 1199k + 24r \equiv 15 \pmod{1199} \]
  Since \( 24 \cdot 1199k \equiv 0 \pmod{1199} \), we are left with:
  \[ 24r \equiv 15 \pmod{1199} \]
  Next, we solve for \( r \) by finding the multiplicative inverse of 24 modulo 1199. The inverse of 24 modulo 1199 is a number \( y \) such that \( 24y \equiv 1 \pmod{1199} \). By trial or using the extended Euclidean algorithm, we find that \( y = 15 \) because:
  \[ 24 \cdot 15 = 360 \equiv 1 \pmod{1199} \]
  Thus, multiplying both sides of the congruence \( 24r \equiv 15 \pmod{1199} \) by 15, we get:
  \[ r \equiv 15 \cdot 15 \pmod{1199} \]
  \[ r \equiv 225 \pmod{1199} \]
  Since \( r \) must be a negative integer, we find that \( r = -449 \) because:
  \[ 225 - 1199 = -974 \equiv -449 \pmod{1199} \]
  Thus, the largest negative integer \( x \) satisfying \( 24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199} \) is \( x = -449 \).
