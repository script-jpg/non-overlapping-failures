  To solve the problem of finding the largest negative integer \( x \) satisfying \( 24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199} \), we need to show that \( x \leq -449 \).
  1. Given \( 24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199} \), we can rewrite this congruence as \( 24x \mod 1199 = 15 \).
  2. We know that \( 24x \mod 1199 = 15 \).
  3. To find the largest negative integer \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) in the congruence \( 24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199} \).
  4. By solving the congruence, we find that \( x \equiv -449 \pmod{1199} \).
  5. Since \( x \) must be negative, the largest negative integer \( x \) that satisfies this congruence is \( -449 \).

  -- Given the congruence condition, we need to show that x ≤ -449.
  have h₂ : 24 * x % 1199 = 15 := h₁
  rw [← mul_one 24] at h₁
  -- We need to show that x ≤ -449.
  have h₃ : x ≤ -449 := by
    -- Use the omega tactic to solve the linear congruence and inequality.
