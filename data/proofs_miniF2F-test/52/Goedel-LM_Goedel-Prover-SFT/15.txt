  To solve the problem of finding the largest negative integer \( x \) such that \( 24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199} \), we need to find the largest negative integer \( x \) that satisfies this congruence. We will show that \( x = -449 \) is the largest such integer.
  1. **Congruence Condition**: Given \( 24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199} \), we need to find the largest negative integer \( x \) that satisfies this condition.
  2. **Simplification**: We can rewrite the congruence as \( 24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199} \). This implies that \( 24x = 1199k + 15 \) for some integer \( k \).
  3. **Solving for \( x \)**: To find the largest negative integer \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) in the congruence \( 24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199} \). We can use the fact that \( 24 \) and \( 1199 \) are coprime, so there exists a unique solution modulo \( 1199 \).
  4. **Verification**: We verify that \( x = -449 \) satisfies the congruence:
     \[
     24(-449) \equiv 15 \pmod{1199}
     \]
     Calculating \( 24(-449) \):
     \[
     24(-449) = -10776
     \]
     Taking modulo \( 1199 \):
     \[
     -10776 \equiv 15 \pmod{1199}
     \]
     This confirms that \( x = -449 \) is indeed a solution.
  5. **Conclusion**: Since \( x = -449 \) is the largest negative integer that satisfies the congruence, we conclude that \( x \leq -449 \).
