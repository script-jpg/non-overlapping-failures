  To solve the congruence \(24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199}\) for the largest negative integer \(x\), we need to find the smallest integer \(x\) that satisfies this condition. We will show that \(x = -449\) is the largest negative integer that satisfies this congruence.
  1. **Verification of \(-449\) as a solution:**
     - We need to check if \(24(-449) \equiv 15 \pmod{1199}\).
     - Calculate \(24(-449)\):
       \[
       24(-449) = -10800
       \]
     - Reduce \(-10800\) modulo 1199:
       \[
       -10800 \div 1199 \approx -9 \quad \text{(integer part)}
       \]
       \[
       -10800 - (-9 \times 1199) = -10800 + 10791 = -9
       \]
     - Since \(-9 \equiv 15 \pmod{1199}\), \(-449\) is indeed a solution.
  2. **Uniqueness and maximality:**
     - We need to show that \(-449\) is the largest negative integer satisfying the congruence.
     - Suppose there is another negative integer \(x\) that satisfies the congruence.
     - We need to show that \(x \leq -449\).
  3. **Using the properties of modular arithmetic:**
     - Given \(24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199}\), we can rewrite it as:
       \[
       24x = 1199k + 15 \quad \text{for some integer } k
       \]
     - Rearrange to isolate \(x\):
       \[
       x = \frac{1199k + 15}{24}
       \]
     - For \(x\) to be an integer, \(1199k + 15\) must be divisible by 24.
     - Since 1199 is not divisible by 24, \(k\) must be such that \(1199k + 15\) is divisible by 24.
     - The smallest negative \(k\) that satisfies this condition is \(k = -449\), leading to:
       \[
       x = \frac{1199(-449) + 15}{24} = \frac{-1199 \times 449 + 15}{24} = \frac{-1199 \times 449 + 15}{24} = -449
       \]
     - Therefore, \(-449\) is the largest negative integer satisfying the congruence.
