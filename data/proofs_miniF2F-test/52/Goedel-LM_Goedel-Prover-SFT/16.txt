  To solve the congruence equation \(24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199}\), we need to find the largest negative integer \(x\) that satisfies this condition. We start by noting that \(x\) must be less than 0. We then use the given congruence to derive the upper bound for \(x\).
  1. Given \(24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199}\), we can rewrite this as \(24x = 1199k + 15\) for some integer \(k\).
  2. Since \(x\) is negative, we can solve for \(x\) modulo 1199.
  3. We need to find the largest negative integer \(x\) such that \(24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199}\).
  4. By solving the congruence, we find that \(x \equiv -449 \pmod{1199}\).
  5. Therefore, the largest negative integer \(x\) that satisfies the congruence is \(-449\).

  -- We start by assuming the negation of the conclusion and aim to derive a contradiction.
  have h : 24 * x % 1199 = 15 := by assumption
  -- We use the `omega` tactic to solve the linear congruence and derive the upper bound for `x`.
  have h₂ : x ≤ -449 := by
    omega
  -- We conclude that `x ≤ -449` based on the derived congruence and the given conditions.
