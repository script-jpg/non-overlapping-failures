  To determine the largest negative integer \( x \) that satisfies \( 24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199} \), we need to find the smallest \( x \) such that the congruence holds. We start by simplifying the congruence and solving for \( x \).
  Given:
  \[ 24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199} \]
  We can rewrite this as:
  \[ 24x = 1199k + 15 \]
  for some integer \( k \). To solve for \( x \), we need to divide both sides by 24. However, since 1199 is a prime number and 24 is not a multiple of 1199, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 24 modulo 1199.
  The multiplicative inverse of 24 modulo 1199 is a number \( y \) such that:
  \[ 24y \equiv 1 \pmod{1199} \]
  By trial or using the extended Euclidean algorithm, we find that \( y = 35 \) because:
  \[ 24 \times 35 = 840 \equiv 1 \pmod{1199} \]
  Thus, multiplying both sides of the original congruence by 35, we get:
  \[ x = \frac{15 \times 35}{24} \]
  Calculating the right-hand side:
  \[ \frac{15 \times 35}{24} = \frac{525}{24} = 21.875 \]
  Since \( x \) must be an integer, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 21. However, we need to verify that this value of \( x \) satisfies the original congruence and is negative.
