  To solve the congruence \(24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199}\), we need to find the largest negative integer \(x\) that satisfies this equation. We start by simplifying the congruence using properties of modular arithmetic.
  Given \(24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199}\), we can rewrite this as:
  \[ 24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199} \]
  This implies:
  \[ 24x - 15 = 1199k \]
  for some integer \(k\). We need to find the largest negative integer \(x\) that satisfies this equation.
  To isolate \(x\), we can use the fact that \(24\) and \(1199\) are coprime. We can find the multiplicative inverse of \(24\) modulo \(1199\) and then multiply both sides of the equation by this inverse.
  The modular inverse of \(24\) modulo \(1199\) is a number \(y\) such that:
  \[ 24y \equiv 1 \pmod{1199} \]
  Using the extended Euclidean algorithm, we find that \(y = 1199 / 24 = 47\).
  Thus, multiplying both sides of \(24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199}\) by \(47\), we get:
  \[ x \equiv 15 \cdot 47 \pmod{1199} \]
  Calculating \(15 \cdot 47\):
  \[ 15 \cdot 47 = 705 \]
  We then reduce \(705\) modulo \(1199\):
  \[ 705 \equiv 354 \pmod{1199} \]
  Thus, we have:
  \[ x \equiv 354 \pmod{1199} \]
  Since \(x\) must be the largest negative integer, we find that \(x = -449\) satisfies the equation:
  \[ 24(-449) \equiv 15 \pmod{1199} \]
