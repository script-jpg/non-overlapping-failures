  To solve the problem of finding the largest negative integer \( x \) such that \( 24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199} \), we start by analyzing the congruence condition. We need to find the largest \( x \) that satisfies this congruence and is negative.
  Given:
  \[ 24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199} \]
  This can be rewritten as:
  \[ 24x \mod 1199 = 15 \]
  We need to find the largest negative integer \( x \) that satisfies this condition. We can use the fact that \( 24 \times 15 \mod 1199 = 15 \) to find a candidate for \( x \).
  First, we compute \( 24 \times 15 \mod 1199 \):
  \[ 24 \times 15 = 360 \]
  \[ 360 \mod 1199 = 360 - 3 \times 1199 = 360 - 3597 = 360 - 3597 = 15 \]
  Thus, \( 24 \times 15 \equiv 15 \pmod{1199} \).
  To find the largest negative integer \( x \) that satisfies this condition, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 24 modulo 1199. The inverse of 24 modulo 1199 is 449 because:
  \[ 24 \times 449 \equiv 1 \pmod{1199} \]
  Therefore, the largest negative integer \( x \) that satisfies \( 24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199} \) is \( x = -449 \).
