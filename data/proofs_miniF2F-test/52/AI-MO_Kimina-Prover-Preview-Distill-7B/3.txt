  -- Since 24 > 0 and 1199 > 0, we know that the solutions to the congruence equation are of the form -449 + 1199 * k where k is an integer. Therefore, in order to find the upper bound of the solution, we only need to find the upper bound of k. In fact, our upper bound of k is 0, which corresponds to the solution -449.
