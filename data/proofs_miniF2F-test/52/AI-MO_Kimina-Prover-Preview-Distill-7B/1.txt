-- The Chinese Remainder Theorem states that if we have congruences modulo two coprime numbers,
  -- then there is a simultaneous congruence modulo their product.
  -- We will use this to solve the given congruence by breaking it into simpler ones.
  have h2 : x % 1199 = 1199 - 449 := by
    -- Solve the congruence $24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199}$ by using the method of successive substitutions.
    -- This means finding an integer $x$ such that $24x - 15$ is divisible by $1199$.
    -- We start by simplifying the congruence. Notice that $24 \equiv 24 \pmod{1199}$ and $15 \equiv 15 \pmod{1199}$.
    -- Let's use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the multiplicative inverse of 24 modulo 1199.
    -- 1199 = 24 × 49 + 23
    -- 24 = 23 × 1 + 1
    -- 23 = 1 × 23 + 0
    -- So, 1 = 24 - 23 × 1 = 24 - (1199 - 24 × 49) × 1 = 24 × 50 - 1199 × 1
    -- This means that 24 × 50 ≡ 1 (mod 1199), so the inverse of 24 modulo 1199 is 50.
    -- Therefore, x ≡ 15 × 50 (mod 1199) ≡ 750 (mod 1199)
    -- But we want the largest negative integer, so we need to subtract 1199: x ≡ 750 - 1199 (mod 1199) ≡ -449 (mod 1199)
    omega

  -- Now that we have x ≡ -449 (mod 1199), we want to show that x ≤ -449.
  -- Since x < 0 (from h₀) and x ≡ -449 (mod 1199) (from h2), it follows that x = -449 + 1199k for some integer k ≤ 0.
  have h3 : x = 1199 - 449 := by
    omega

  -- Therefore, x = -449 + 1199k for some integer k ≤ 0, and so x ≤ -449.
