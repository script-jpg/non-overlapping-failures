  To find the smallest positive integer \( k \) such that for every positive integer \( n \), \( 6n + k \) is relatively prime to each of \( 6n + 3 \), \( 6n + 2 \), and \( 6n + 1 \), we need to show that \( k = 5 \) is the smallest such integer.
  1. **Relational Prime Condition**: For \( 6n + k \) to be relatively prime to \( 6n + 3 \), \( 6n + 2 \), and \( 6n + 1 \), their greatest common divisors (gcd) with \( 6n + k \) must be 1.
  2. **Condition Analysis**:
     - For \( 6n + 3 \), the gcd with \( 6n + k \) is 1.
     - For \( 6n + 2 \), the gcd with \( 6n + k \) is 1.
     - For \( 6n + 1 \), the gcd with \( 6n + k \) is 1.
  3. **Implication**: Since the gcd of \( 6n + k \) with each of \( 6n + 3 \), \( 6n + 2 \), and \( 6n + 1 \) is 1, \( k \) must be at least 5 to ensure \( 6n + k \) is relatively prime to all these numbers.
  4. **Conclusion**: By checking the smallest possible values and ensuring the gcd condition holds, we find that \( k = 5 \) is the smallest value that satisfies the condition for all \( n \).
