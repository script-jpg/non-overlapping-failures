  To find the smallest positive integer \( k \) such that for every positive integer \( n \), \( 6n + k \) is relatively prime to each of \( 6n + 3 \), \( 6n + 2 \), and \( 6n + 1 \), we need to show that \( k = 5 \). We start by assuming \( k < 5 \) and examining the conditions for \( k = 1, 2, 3, 4 \) and showing that none of these values satisfy the given conditions.
