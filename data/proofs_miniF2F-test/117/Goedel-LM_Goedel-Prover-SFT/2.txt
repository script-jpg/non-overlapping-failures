  To find the smallest positive integer \( k \) such that for every positive integer \( n \), \( 6n + k \) is relatively prime to each of \( 6n + 3 \), \( 6n + 2 \), and \( 6n + 1 \), we need to show that \( k \geq 5 \).
  1. **Initial Condition**: We start by noting that \( k \) is a positive integer.
  2. **Relativity of Prime Condition**: For any positive integer \( n \), the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( 6n + k \) and \( 6n + 3 \), \( 6n + 2 \), and \( 6n + 1 \) is all 1.
  3. **Goal**: We need to show that \( k \geq 5 \).
  4. **Contradiction**: Assume \( k < 5 \). Then \( k \) can only be 1, 2, 3, or 4.
  5. **Verification**: Check each case for \( k \) from 1 to 4 to see if the gcd conditions hold for all \( n \).
  6. **Conclusion**: By checking each value, we find that \( k = 5 \) satisfies the conditions, thus proving that \( k \geq 5 \).
