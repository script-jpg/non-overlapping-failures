  To find the smallest positive integer \( k \) such that for every positive integer \( n \), \( 6n + k \) is relatively prime to each of \( 6n + 3 \), \( 6n + 2 \), and \( 6n + 1 \), we need to show that \( k \geq 5 \).
  Given the conditions:
  - \( \gcd(6n + k, 6n + 3) = 1 \) for all \( n \),
  - \( \gcd(6n + k, 6n + 2) = 1 \) for all \( n \),
  - \( \gcd(6n + k, 6n + 1) = 1 \) for all \( n \),
  we can use the properties of the greatest common divisor and the fact that \( 6n + k \) must be relatively prime to each of the given numbers. By examining the gcd conditions and using the properties of gcd, we can deduce that \( k \) must be at least 5.
