  To find the smallest positive integer \( k \) such that for every positive integer \( n \), \( 6n + k \) is relatively prime to each of \( 6n + 3 \), \( 6n + 2 \), and \( 6n + 1 \), we need to show that \( k \geq 5 \). We will use the properties of coprimeness and the given hypotheses to derive this result.

  -- We need to show that 5 is the smallest positive integer k that satisfies the given conditions.
  apply Nat.le_of_not_lt
  intro h
  -- Assume for contradiction that k < 5.
  have h₄ := h₁ 0
  have h₅ := h₂ 0
  have h₆ := h₃ 0
  -- Consider the gcd conditions for n = 0.
  simp_all [Nat.gcd_comm]
  -- Simplify the gcd conditions and derive a contradiction.
