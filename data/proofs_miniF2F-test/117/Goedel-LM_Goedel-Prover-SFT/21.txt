  To find the smallest positive integer \( k \) such that for every positive integer \( n \), \( 6n + k \) is relatively prime to each of \( 6n + 3 \), \( 6n + 2 \), and \( 6n + 1 \), we need to show that \( k \) must be at least 5. We will use the properties of the greatest common divisor (gcd) and the fact that \( 6n + k \) must be coprime with all these expressions.

  -- Assume k < 5, we will show that this leads to a contradiction.
  have h₄ := h₁ 0
  have h₅ := h₂ 0
  have h₆ := h₃ 0
  -- Consider the gcd of (6 * 0 + k) with (6 * 0 + 3), (6 * 0 + 2), and (6 * 0 + 1).
  simp [Nat.gcd_zero_left] at h₄ h₅ h₆
  -- Simplify the expressions using the fact that gcd(a, 0) = a.
  -- This will show that the gcd conditions cannot hold for any k < 5.
