  To find the smallest positive integer \( k \) such that, for every positive integer \( n \), \( 6n + k \) is relatively prime to each of \( 6n + 3 \), \( 6n + 2 \), and \( 6n + 1 \), we need to show that \( k = 5 \) is the smallest such integer.
  Given the conditions:
  1. \( 6n + k \) is relatively prime to \( 6n + 3 \) for all \( n \).
  2. \( 6n + k \) is relatively prime to \( 6n + 2 \) for all \( n \).
  3. \( 6n + k \) is relatively prime to \( 6n + 1 \) for all \( n \).
  We will use the fact that if \( 6n + k \) is relatively prime to \( 6n + 3 \), \( 6n + 2 \), and \( 6n + 1 \), then \( k \) must be at least 5. This is because the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( 6n + 3 \), \( 6n + 2 \), and \( 6n + 1 \) is 1, and the smallest \( k \) that satisfies this condition is 5.
