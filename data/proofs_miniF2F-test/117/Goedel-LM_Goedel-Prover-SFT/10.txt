  To find the smallest positive integer \( k \) such that for every positive integer \( n \), \( 6n + k \) is relatively prime to each of \( 6n + 3 \), \( 6n + 2 \), and \( 6n + 1 \), we need to show that \( k \geq 5 \). We will use the properties of gcd and the given conditions to derive this result.
  1. Start by considering the conditions \( h_1 \), \( h_2 \), and \( h_3 \).
  2. Apply the gcd properties to specific values of \( n \) to derive constraints on \( k \).
  3. Use the fact that \( 6n + k \) is relatively prime to each of the given expressions to establish lower bounds for \( k \).
