  To find the smallest positive integer \( k \) such that for every positive integer \( n \), \( 6n + k \) is relatively prime to each of \( 6n + 3 \), \( 6n + 2 \), and \( 6n + 1 \), we need to show that \( k = 5 \) is the smallest such integer.
  Given the conditions:
  1. \( \gcd(6n + k, 6n + 3) = 1 \) for all \( n \).
  2. \( \gcd(6n + k, 6n + 2) = 1 \) for all \( n \).
  3. \( \gcd(6n + k, 6n + 1) = 1 \) for all \( n \).
  We will use these conditions to derive the necessary inequality for \( k \).
