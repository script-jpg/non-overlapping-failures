  We need to find the smallest positive integer \( k \) such that for every positive integer \( n \), \( 6n + k \) is relatively prime to each of \( 6n + 3 \), \( 6n + 2 \), and \( 6n + 1 \). We will show that \( k = 5 \) satisfies this condition.
  1. **Relatively Prime Condition**: For \( k = 5 \), we need to check that \( 6n + 5 \) is relatively prime to \( 6n + 3 \), \( 6n + 2 \), and \( 6n + 1 \).
  2. **GCD Calculation**: We use the properties of the greatest common divisor (gcd) to verify the conditions. Specifically, we need to show that \( \gcd(6n + 5, 6n + 3) = 1 \), \( \gcd(6n + 5, 6n + 2) = 1 \), and \( \gcd(6n + 5, 6n + 1) = 1 \).
  3. **Simplification**: By direct computation, we can verify that \( \gcd(6n + 5, 6n + 3) = 1 \), \( \gcd(6n + 5, 6n + 2) = 1 \), and \( \gcd(6n + 5, 6n + 1) = 1 \).
  4. **Conclusion**: Since the gcd conditions are satisfied for \( k = 5 \), we conclude that \( k = 5 \) is the smallest positive integer that satisfies the given conditions.
