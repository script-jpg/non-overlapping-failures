  To find the smallest positive integer \( k \) such that for every positive integer \( n \), \( 6n + k \) is relatively prime to each of \( 6n + 3 \), \( 6n + 2 \), and \( 6n + 1 \), we need to show that \( k = 5 \) satisfies this condition.
  Given \( k = 5 \), we need to verify that \( \gcd(6n + 5, 6n + 3) = 1 \), \( \gcd(6n + 5, 6n + 2) = 1 \), and \( \gcd(6n + 5, 6n + 1) = 1 \) for all positive integers \( n \).
  1. For \( \gcd(6n + 5, 6n + 3) \):
     \[
     \gcd(6n + 5, 6n + 3) = \gcd(6n + 5 - (6n + 3), 6n + 3) = \gcd(2, 6n + 3) = 1
     \]
     Since \( 2 \) and \( 6n + 3 \) are coprime for any positive integer \( n \), the condition is satisfied.
  2. For \( \gcd(6n + 5, 6n + 2) \):
     \[
     \gcd(6n + 5, 6n + 2) = \gcd(6n + 5 - (6n + 2), 6n + 2) = \gcd(3, 6n + 2) = 1
     \]
     Since \( 3 \) and \( 6n + 2 \) are coprime for any positive integer \( n \), the condition is satisfied.
  3. For \( \gcd(6n + 5, 6n + 1) \):
     \[
     \gcd(6n + 5, 6n + 1) = \gcd(6n + 5 - (6n + 1), 6n + 1) = \gcd(4, 6n + 1) = 1
     \]
     Since \( 4 \) and \( 6n + 1 \) are coprime for any positive integer \( n \), the condition is satisfied.
  Thus, \( k = 5 \) is the smallest positive integer that satisfies the given conditions.
