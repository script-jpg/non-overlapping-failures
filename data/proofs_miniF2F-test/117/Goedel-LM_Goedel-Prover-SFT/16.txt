  To find the smallest positive integer \( k \) such that for every positive integer \( n \), \( 6n + k \) is relatively prime to each of \( 6n + 3 \), \( 6n + 2 \), and \( 6n + 1 \), we need to show that \( k = 5 \) is the smallest such integer.
  1. Given the conditions \( \gcd(6n + k, 6n + 3) = 1 \), \( \gcd(6n + k, 6n + 2) = 1 \), and \( \gcd(6n + k, 6n + 1) = 1 \) for all \( n \), we need to prove \( 5 \leq k \).
  2. By contradiction, assume \( k < 5 \). We will show that this leads to a contradiction by evaluating the conditions for specific values of \( n \).
  3. Evaluate the conditions for \( n = 0 \), \( n = 1 \), \( n = 2 \), and \( n = 3 \).
  4. Simplify the expressions and use the properties of gcd to derive contradictions for each case.
  5. Conclude that \( k \) must be at least 5.
