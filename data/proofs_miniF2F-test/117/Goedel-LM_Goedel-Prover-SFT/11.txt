  To find the smallest positive integer \( k \) such that for every positive integer \( n \), \( 6n + k \) is relatively prime to each of \( 6n + 3 \), \( 6n + 2 \), and \( 6n + 1 \), we need to show that \( k = 5 \) satisfies this condition.
  1. **Relatively Prime Condition**: For any positive integer \( n \), \( 6n + k \) is relatively prime to \( 6n + 3 \), \( 6n + 2 \), and \( 6n + 1 \).
  2. **Objective**: We need to prove that \( k = 5 \) is the smallest such integer.
  3. **Proof by Contradiction**: Assume \( k < 5 \). We will show that for some \( n \), \( 6n + k \) is not relatively prime to \( 6n + 3 \), \( 6n + 2 \), and \( 6n + 1 \).
  4. **Case Analysis**:
     - If \( k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \), then \( 6n + k \) is not relatively prime to \( 6n + 3 \), \( 6n + 2 \), and \( 6n + 1 \).
  5. **Conclusion**: Since \( k = 5 \) is the smallest positive integer that satisfies the condition, we conclude that \( k \geq 5 \).
