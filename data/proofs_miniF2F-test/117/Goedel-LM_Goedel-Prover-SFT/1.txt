  To find the smallest positive integer \( k \) such that for every positive integer \( n \), \( 6n + k \) is relatively prime to each of \( 6n + 3 \), \( 6n + 2 \), and \( 6n + 1 \), we need to show that \( k \geq 5 \). We will use the properties of the greatest common divisor (gcd) and the fact that \( 6n + k \) must be relatively prime to each of the given expressions.
  1. **Initial Conditions**: We start by noting that \( k \) is a positive integer and that for all \( n \), \( \gcd(6n + k, 6n + 3) = 1 \), \( \gcd(6n + k, 6n + 2) = 1 \), and \( \gcd(6n + k, 6n + 1) = 1 \).
  2. **Relativity of Prime**: We use the fact that if \( \gcd(a, b) = 1 \), then \( a \) and \( b \) are relatively prime.
  3. **Simplification and Application of Gcd Properties**: We use the properties of gcd to simplify the expressions and show that \( k \) must be at least 5.
  4. **Conclusion**: By applying the properties of gcd and using the fact that \( k \) is a positive integer, we conclude that \( k \geq 5 \).
