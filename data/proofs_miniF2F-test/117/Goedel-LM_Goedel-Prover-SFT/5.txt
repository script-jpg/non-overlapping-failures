  To find the smallest positive integer \( k \) such that for every positive integer \( n \), \( 6n + k \) is relatively prime to each of \( 6n + 3 \), \( 6n + 2 \), and \( 6n + 1 \), we need to show that \( k = 5 \) is the smallest such integer.
  1. **Relatively Prime Condition**: We need to ensure that \( 6n + k \) is relatively prime to each of \( 6n + 3 \), \( 6n + 2 \), and \( 6n + 1 \). This means that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( 6n + k \) and each of these expressions is 1.
  2. **GCD Conditions**:
     - \( \gcd(6n + k, 6n + 3) = 1 \)
     - \( \gcd(6n + k, 6n + 2) = 1 \)
     - \( \gcd(6n + k, 6n + 1) = 1 \)
  3. **Specific Value**: We need to show that \( k = 5 \) satisfies these conditions and is the smallest such integer.
