  To find the smallest positive integer \( k \) such that for every positive integer \( n \), \( 6n + k \) is relatively prime to each of \( 6n + 3 \), \( 6n + 2 \), and \( 6n + 1 \), we need to ensure that \( \gcd(6n + k, 6n + 3) = 1 \), \( \gcd(6n + k, 6n + 2) = 1 \), and \( \gcd(6n + k, 6n + 1) = 1 \) for all \( n \). We will show that \( k = 5 \) satisfies these conditions.
