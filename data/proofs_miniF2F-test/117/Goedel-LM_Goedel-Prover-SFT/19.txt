  To find the smallest positive integer \( k \) such that for every positive integer \( n \), \( 6n + k \) is relatively prime to each of \( 6n + 3 \), \( 6n + 2 \), and \( 6n + 1 \), we need to show that \( k \geq 5 \).
  1. Assume for contradiction that \( k < 5 \).
  2. We will check each possible value of \( k \) from 1 to 4 and show that for each case, there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( 6n + k \) is not relatively prime to \( 6n + 3 \), \( 6n + 2 \), and \( 6n + 1 \).
  3. For each \( k \) in the specified range, we will find such an \( n \).
  4. By contradiction, we conclude that \( k \) must be at least 5.
