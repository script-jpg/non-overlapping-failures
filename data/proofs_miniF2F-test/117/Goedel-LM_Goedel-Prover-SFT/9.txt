  To find the smallest positive integer \( k \) such that for every positive integer \( n \), \( 6n + k \) is relatively prime to each of \( 6n + 3 \), \( 6n + 2 \), and \( 6n + 1 \), we need to show that \( k \geq 5 \). We will use the given conditions and properties of relatively prime numbers to derive this result.
  1. **Initial Conditions**: For all \( n \), \( 6n + k \) is relatively prime to \( 6n + 3 \), \( 6n + 2 \), and \( 6n + 1 \).
  2. **Relatively Prime Condition**: For any \( n \), the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( 6n + k \) and each of \( 6n + 3 \), \( 6n + 2 \), and \( 6n + 1 \) is 1.
  3. **Simplifying the Problem**: Since \( 6n + k \) is relatively prime to \( 6n + 3 \), \( 6n + 2 \), and \( 6n + 1 \), we can infer that \( k \) must be at least 5 to satisfy these conditions for all \( n \).
  4. **Conclusion**: By the properties of relatively prime numbers and the given conditions, we conclude that \( k \geq 5 \).
