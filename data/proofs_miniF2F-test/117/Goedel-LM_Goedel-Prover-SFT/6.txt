  To find the smallest positive integer \( k \) such that for every positive integer \( n \), \( 6n + k \) is relatively prime to each of \( 6n + 3 \), \( 6n + 2 \), and \( 6n + 1 \), we need to ensure that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( 6n + k \) with each of these expressions is 1. This implies that \( k \) must be at least 5 to satisfy the given conditions.
