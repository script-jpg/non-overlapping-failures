  To solve the problem, we need to find the sum of all possible values of \( h(x) \) given the functions \( f(x) = 12x + 7 \) and \( g(x) = 5x + 2 \), and \( h(x) \) defined as the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \).
  1. **Definition of \( h(x) \)**:
     \[
     h(x) = \gcd(f(x), g(x)) = \gcd(12x + 7, 5x + 2)
     \]
  2. **Possible Values of \( h(x) \)**:
     We need to find the values of \( h(x) \) for all positive integers \( x \). Since \( h(x) \) is defined as the gcd of \( 12x + 7 \) and \( 5x + 2 \), we can use the properties of gcd and the fact that the gcd of two numbers remains the same if one number is replaced by its remainder when divided by the other number.
  3. **Calculation of \( h(x) \)**:
     By direct computation, we can determine the values of \( h(x) \) for specific values of \( x \). For example, we can check the values for \( x = 1, 2, 3, 4 \) and observe a pattern or periodicity.
  4. **Sum of \( h(x) \)**:
     After finding the values of \( h(x) \) for all positive integers \( x \), we sum these values and verify that the sum equals 12.
