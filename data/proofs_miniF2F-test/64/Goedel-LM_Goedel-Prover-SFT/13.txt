  To solve the problem, we need to find the sum of all possible values of \( h(x) \), where \( h(x) = \gcd(f(x), g(x)) \) and \( f(x) = 12x + 7 \), \( g(x) = 5x + 2 \). We will show that the sum of all possible values of \( h(x) \) is 12.
  1. **Determine the values of \( h(x) \)**:
     - For each \( x \), calculate \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \).
     - Compute the greatest common divisor \( h(x) \) of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \).
  2. **Identify the range of \( h(x) \)**:
     - Since \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) are linear functions, their values are unbounded. However, the greatest common divisor \( h(x) \) is a finite number.
  3. **Calculate the sum of the possible values of \( h(x) \)**:
     - Given the constraints of the problem, we need to find the sum of all possible values of \( h(x) \).
