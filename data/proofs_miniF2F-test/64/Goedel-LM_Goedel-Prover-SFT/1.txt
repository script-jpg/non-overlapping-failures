  To solve the problem, we need to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( f(x) = 12x + 7 \) and \( g(x) = 5x + 2 \) for all positive integers \( x \). We then need to determine the sum of all possible values of the gcd of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \).
  1. **Express the gcd in terms of \( x \)**:
     \[
     \text{gcd}(12x + 7, 5x + 2)
     \]
     Using the properties of gcd, we can simplify this expression.
  2. **Use the Euclidean algorithm**:
     \[
     \text{gcd}(12x + 7, 5x + 2) = \text{gcd}(5x + 2, 12x + 7 - 5x - 2) = \text{gcd}(5x + 2, 7x + 5)
     \]
     This process can be repeated until we reach a simple form.
  3. **Find the gcd of simplified forms**:
     By simplifying, we find that the gcd is a constant value for all positive integers \( x \).
  4. **Sum the gcd values**:
     Since the gcd is constant, the sum of all possible values of the gcd is simply the gcd itself.
