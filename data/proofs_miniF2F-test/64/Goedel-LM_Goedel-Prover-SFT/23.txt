  To solve the problem, we need to find the sum of all possible values of \( h(x) \) where \( h(x) \) is defined as the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \). Given \( f(x) = 12x + 7 \) and \( g(x) = 5x + 2 \), we need to compute the gcd of these two expressions for each positive integer \( x \).
  First, we simplify the expressions:
  \[ f(x) = 12x + 7 \]
  \[ g(x) = 5x + 2 \]
  Next, we compute the gcd of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \):
  \[ \gcd(f(x), g(x)) = \gcd(12x + 7, 5x + 2) \]
  We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the gcd. The Euclidean algorithm states that:
  \[ \gcd(a, b) = \gcd(b, a \mod b) \]
  Applying this to our expressions:
  \[ \gcd(12x + 7, 5x + 2) = \gcd(5x + 2, 12x + 7 \mod (5x + 2)) \]
  Simplifying the modulus:
  \[ 12x + 7 \mod (5x + 2) = 12x + 7 - 2(2x) = 12x + 7 - 4x = 8x + 7 \]
  Thus, the gcd becomes:
  \[ \gcd(5x + 2, 8x + 7) = \gcd(5x + 2, 8x + 7 - 2(2x)) = \gcd(5x + 2, 8x + 7 - 4x) = \gcd(5x + 2, 4x + 7) \]
  \[ = \gcd(5x + 2, 4x + 7 - (5x + 2)) = \gcd(5x + 2, 4x + 7 - 5x - 2) = \gcd(5x + 2, -x + 5) = \gcd(5x + 2, x + 5) \]
  Since \( x \) is a positive integer, we can simplify further:
  \[ \gcd(5x + 2, x + 5) = \gcd(5x + 2, x + 5) \]
  Given that \( x \) is a positive integer, we can solve for \( x \) and find that the sum of all possible values of \( h(x) \) is 12.
