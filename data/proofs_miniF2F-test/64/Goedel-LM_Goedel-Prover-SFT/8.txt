  To solve the problem, we need to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( f(x) = 12x + 7 \) and \( g(x) = 5x + 2 \) for each positive integer \( x \). We then need to sum these gcd values over all possible values of \( x \) and show that the sum is 12.
  1. **Define the functions**:
     - \( f(x) = 12x + 7 \)
     - \( g(x) = 5x + 2 \)
  2. **Calculate the gcd**:
     - For each \( x \), the gcd of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) is given by \( \gcd(12x + 7, 5x + 2) \).
  3. **Simplify the gcd expression**:
     - Using the properties of gcd and the fact that \( \gcd(a, b) = \gcd(b, a \mod b) \), we can simplify the expression.
  4. **Sum the gcd values**:
     - We need to sum all possible values of \( \gcd(12x + 7, 5x + 2) \) over all \( x \).
  5. **Verify the sum**:
     - Given the constraints and the properties of gcd, we can deduce that the sum of all such gcd values is 12.
