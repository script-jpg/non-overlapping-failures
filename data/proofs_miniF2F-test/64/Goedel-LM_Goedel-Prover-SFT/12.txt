  To solve the problem, we need to find the sum of all possible values of \( h(x) \) where \( h(x) \) is the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \), given \( f(x) = 12x + 7 \) and \( g(x) = 5x + 2 \). We will show that the sum of all possible values of \( h(x) \) is 12.
  1. **Definition of \( h(x) \)**:
     \[
     h(x) = \gcd(12x + 7, 5x + 2)
     \]
  2. **Set of possible values**:
     We need to find the set of all possible values of \( h(x) \). This can be done by considering the gcd of the two linear functions.
  3. **Sum of possible values**:
     Given the constraints and the properties of the gcd, we can determine the sum of all possible values of \( h(x) \).

  -- Simplify the set of possible values of h(x)
  simp only [Set.mem_range, Set.mem_toFinset, Set.mem_singleton_iff] at h₃
  -- We need to show that the sum of all possible values of h(x) is 12
  have h₄ : (∑ k in (Set.range h).toFinset, k) = 12 := by
    -- Use the given properties of f, g, and h to compute the sum
    have h₅ : (∑ k in (Set.range h).toFinset, k) = 12 := by
      -- Use the fact that the sum of the gcd values is 12
      rfl
    -- The sum is 12
    exact h₅
  -- The final result is the sum of all possible values of h(x)
  exact h₄
