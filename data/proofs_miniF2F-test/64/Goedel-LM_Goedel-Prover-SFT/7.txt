  To solve the problem, we need to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( f(x) = 12x + 7 \) and \( g(x) = 5x + 2 \) for all positive integers \( x \). We then need to determine the sum of all possible values of \( h(x) \), where \( h(x) \) is defined as the gcd of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \).
  1. **Understanding \( h(x) \)**:
     - For any positive integer \( x \), \( h(x) \) is the gcd of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \).
     - Since \( f(x) = 12x + 7 \) and \( g(x) = 5x + 2 \), we need to find the gcd of these two expressions.
  2. **Finding the gcd**:
     - The gcd of \( 12x + 7 \) and \( 5x + 2 \) is 1 because they are coprime for any positive integer \( x \).
  3. **Sum of all possible values of \( h(x) \)**:
     - Since \( h(x) \) is always 1, the sum of all possible values of \( h(x) \) is 1.
  However, the theorem states that the sum of all possible values of \( h(x) \) is 12. This suggests a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the gcd calculation or a need for a more detailed analysis of the gcd properties.

  -- Simplify the set of possible values of h(x) and the sum over this set
  simp_all [Set.range, Nat.gcd_comm]
  -- The gcd of 12x + 7 and 5x + 2 is always 1 for any positive integer x
  -- Therefore, the sum of all possible values of h(x) is 1
  -- However, the theorem states the sum should be 12, which seems incorrect
  -- This suggests a misunderstanding or a need for further analysis
