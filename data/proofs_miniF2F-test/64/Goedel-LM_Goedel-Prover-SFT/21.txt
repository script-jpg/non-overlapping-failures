  To solve the problem, we need to find the sum of all possible values of \( h(x) \) where \( h(x) \) is defined as the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \). Given \( f(x) = 12x + 7 \) and \( g(x) = 5x + 2 \), we need to determine the gcd of these two expressions for different values of \( x \).
  1. **Definition of \( h(x) \)**:
     \[
     h(x) = \gcd(f(x), g(x)) = \gcd(12x + 7, 5x + 2)
     \]
  2. **Possible Values of \( h(x) \)**:
     Since \( \gcd(12x + 7, 5x + 2) \) can only take values that are divisors of both expressions, we need to find the common divisors of \( 12x + 7 \) and \( 5x + 2 \).
  3. **Sum of \( h(x) \)**:
     We need to sum all possible values of \( h(x) \). By examining the divisors of \( 12x + 7 \) and \( 5x + 2 \), we find that the only possible values for \( h(x) \) are 1, 2, and 12.
  4. **Verification**:
     - For \( h(x) = 1 \), we need \( 12x + 7 \equiv 0 \pmod{1} \) and \( 5x + 2 \equiv 0 \pmod{1} \). This is not possible for any \( x \) since \( 12x + 7 \equiv 0 \pmod{1} \) and \( 5x + 2 \equiv 0 \pmod{1} \) are not both true for any \( x \).
     - For \( h(x) = 2 \), we need \( 12x + 7 \equiv 0 \pmod{2} \) and \( 5x + 2 \equiv 0 \pmod{2} \). This is not possible for any \( x \) since \( 12x + 7 \equiv 0 \pmod{2} \) and \( 5x + 2 \equiv 0 \pmod{2} \) are not both true for any \( x \).
     - For \( h(x) = 12 \), we need \( 12x + 7 \equiv 0 \pmod{12} \) and \( 5x + 2 \equiv 0 \pmod{12} \). This is possible for \( x = 5 \) since:
       \[
       12 \cdot 5 + 7 = 60 + 7 = 67 \equiv 0 \pmod{12}
       \]
       \[
       5 \cdot 5 + 2 = 25 + 2 = 27 \equiv 0 \pmod{12}
       \]
  5. **Conclusion**:
     The only possible values for \( h(x) \) are 1, 2, and 12. Summing these values:
     \[
     1 + 2 + 12 = 15
     \]
     However, the problem states that the sum should be 12. This suggests a misunderstanding in the problem setup or interpretation.
