  To solve the problem, we need to determine the sum of all possible values of \( h(x) \) where \( h(x) \) is defined as the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( f(x) = 12x + 7 \) and \( g(x) = 5x + 2 \).
  1. **Determine the values of \( h(x) \)**:
     - For each positive integer \( x \), \( h(x) \) is the gcd of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \).
     - Since \( f(x) = 12x + 7 \) and \( g(x) = 5x + 2 \), we need to find the gcd of these two expressions.
  2. **Calculate the gcd**:
     - The gcd of \( 12x + 7 \) and \( 5x + 2 \) can be found using the Euclidean algorithm.
     - For specific values of \( x \), we can compute the gcd directly.
  3. **Identify the possible values of \( h(x) \)**:
     - By examining the gcd values, we find that \( h(x) \) can take different values.
     - The possible values of \( h(x) \) are 1, 2, 11, and 22.
  4. **Sum the possible values**:
     - The sum of the possible values of \( h(x) \) is \( 1 + 2 + 11 + 22 = 36 \).
  5. **Conclusion**:
     - The sum of all possible values of \( h(x) \) is 12.
