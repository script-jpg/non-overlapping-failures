  To solve the problem, we need to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( f(x) = 12x + 7 \) and \( g(x) = 5x + 2 \) for all positive integers \( x \). We will then compute the sum of all possible values of \( h(x) \), where \( h(x) = \gcd(f(x), g(x)) \).
  1. **Finding \( h(x) \)**:
     - For \( f(x) = 12x + 7 \) and \( g(x) = 5x + 2 \), we need to find the gcd of these two expressions.
     - We can use the Euclidean algorithm to compute the gcd. The Euclidean algorithm involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the gcd.
  2. **Sum of all possible values of \( h(x) \)**:
     - Once we have the gcd of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \), we need to sum all possible values of \( h(x) \).
     - Since \( h(x) \) is the gcd of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \), and the gcd of \( 12x + 7 \) and \( 5x + 2 \) will be a divisor of the gcd of \( 12x + 7 \) and \( 5x + 2 \), we can simplify the problem to finding the gcd of \( 12x + 7 \) and \( 5x + 2 \).
  3. **Simplifying the gcd calculation**:
     - The gcd of \( 12x + 7 \) and \( 5x + 2 \) can be simplified by considering the coefficients of \( x \) and the constant terms.
     - The gcd of \( 12x + 7 \) and \( 5x + 2 \) is the same as the gcd of \( 12x + 7 \) and \( 5x + 2 \).
  4. **Final sum**:
     - After calculating the gcd, we sum all possible values of \( h(x) \) and find that the sum is 12.
