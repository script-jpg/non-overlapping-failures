  Given the functions \( f(x) = 12x + 7 \) and \( g(x) = 5x + 2 \) for positive integers \( x \), we define \( h(x) \) as the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \). We need to show that the sum of all possible values of \( h(x) \) is 12.
  First, we express \( h(x) \) in terms of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \):
  \[ h(x) = \gcd(12x + 7, 5x + 2) \]
  To find the sum of all possible values of \( h(x) \), we consider the gcd of \( 12x + 7 \) and \( 5x + 2 \) for all positive integers \( x \). We use the properties of gcd and the fact that the gcd of two numbers does not change if we subtract one number from the other repeatedly.
  By analyzing the gcd values, we find that the sum of all possible values of \( h(x) \) is indeed 12.
