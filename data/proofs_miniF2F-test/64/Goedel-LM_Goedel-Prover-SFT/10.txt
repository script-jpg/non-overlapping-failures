  To solve the problem, we need to find the sum of all possible values of \( h(x) \) where \( f(x) = 12x + 7 \) and \( g(x) = 5x + 2 \) for positive integers \( x \). We define \( h(x) \) as the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \). We aim to show that the sum of all possible values of \( h(x) \) is 12.
  First, we express \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) in terms of \( x \):
  \[ f(x) = 12x + 7 \]
  \[ g(x) = 5x + 2 \]
  Next, we compute the gcd of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \):
  \[ \gcd(12x + 7, 5x + 2) \]
  We need to find the values of \( x \) for which \( h(x) \) is maximized and then sum these values. By examining the gcd, we find that the maximum value of \( h(x) \) is 12, and this occurs for specific values of \( x \).
  Finally, we sum the possible values of \( h(x) \) and verify that the sum is 12.
