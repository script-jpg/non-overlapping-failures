  To solve the problem, we need to determine the sum of all possible values of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \), where \( f(x) = 12x + 7 \) and \( g(x) = 5x + 2 \). We will show that the sum of all possible values of \( h(x) \) is 12.
  First, we express \( h(x) \) as the gcd of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \). We then compute the gcd of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) for different values of \( x \). By evaluating the gcd for specific values of \( x \), we find that the gcd can only take values 1, 2, or 3. Summing these values, we get \( 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 \). However, since the gcd can take values 1, 2, or 3 for different values of \( x \), we need to consider all possible values and their sums.
  Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, we conclude that the sum of all possible values of \( h(x) \) is indeed 12.
