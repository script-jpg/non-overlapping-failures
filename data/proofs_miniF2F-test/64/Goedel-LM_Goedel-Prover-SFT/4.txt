  To solve the problem, we need to find the sum of all possible values of \( h(x) \) where \( h(x) \) is the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \), with \( f(x) = 12x + 7 \) and \( g(x) = 5x + 2 \).
  1. **Determine the values of \( h(x) \)**:
     - For \( h(x) \) to be the gcd of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \), we need to find the common divisors of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \).
     - Given \( f(x) = 12x + 7 \) and \( g(x) = 5x + 2 \), we can factorize them as follows:
       - \( f(x) = 12x + 7 \)
       - \( g(x) = 5x + 2 \)
     - The common divisors of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) are the divisors of their gcd.
  2. **Calculate the gcd of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \)**:
     - The gcd of \( 12x + 7 \) and \( 5x + 2 \) can be found using the Euclidean algorithm.
     - Applying the Euclidean algorithm:
       - \( 12x + 7 \)
       - \( 5x + 2 \)
       - \( 12x + 7 = 5(2x) + 2 \)
       - \( 5(2x) + 2 = 2(2x) + 7 \)
       - \( 2(2x) + 7 = 7(x) + 2 \)
       - \( 7(x) + 2 = 2(x) + 7 \)
     - The gcd of \( 12x + 7 \) and \( 5x + 2 \) is \( 12x + 7 \).
  3. **Find the possible values of \( h(x) \)**:
     - The gcd of \( 12x + 7 \) and \( 5x + 2 \) is always 12.
  4. **Sum the possible values of \( h(x) \)**:
     - The possible values of \( h(x) \) are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.
     - The sum of these values is \( 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 12 = 28 \).
  5. **Conclusion**:
     - The sum of all possible values of \( h(x) \) is 12.
