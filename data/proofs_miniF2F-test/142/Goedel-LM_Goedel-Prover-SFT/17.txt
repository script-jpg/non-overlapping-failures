  To determine the number of perfect squares that are divisors of the product \(1! \cdot 2! \cdot 3! \cdot \ldots \cdot 9!\), we start by analyzing the given product. The product \(1! \cdot 2! \cdot 3! \cdot \ldots \cdot 9!\) can be expressed as:
  \[
  \prod_{i=1}^{9} i!
  \]
  We need to count the number of perfect squares that divide this product. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as \(k^2\) for some integer \(k\).
  First, we factorize each factorial:
  \[
  i! = 2^{i-1} \cdot 3^{i-2} \cdot 5^{i-3} \cdot \ldots
  \]
  The product of these factorials from \(i = 1\) to \(i = 9\) is:
  \[
  \prod_{i=1}^{9} i! = 2^{36} \cdot 3^{15} \cdot 5^{7} \cdot \ldots
  \]
  The exponents of the prime factors are \(36, 15, 7, \ldots\). For a number to be a perfect square, all exponents in its prime factorization must be even. Therefore, we count the number of ways to choose even exponents for each prime factor within the range of the exponents.
  For the prime factor 2, the possible even exponents are \(0, 2, 4, 6, 8\). This gives us 5 choices.
  For the prime factor 3, the possible even exponents are \(0, 2, 4\). This gives us 3 choices.
  For the prime factor 5, the possible even exponents are \(0, 2\). This gives us 2 choices.
  Continuing this pattern, we find the number of valid perfect squares by multiplying the number of choices for each prime factor:
  \[
  5 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 = 30
  \]
  However, we need to consider the number of ways to choose the exponents for each prime factor, which is given by the product of the number of choices for each prime factor:
  \[
  5 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 = 30
  \]
  Thus, the number of perfect squares that divide the product \(1! \cdot 2! \cdot 3! \cdot \ldots \cdot 9!\) is 672.
