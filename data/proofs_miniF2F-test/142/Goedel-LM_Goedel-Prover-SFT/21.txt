  To determine how many perfect squares are divisors of the product \(1! \cdot 2! \cdot 3! \cdot \ldots \cdot 9!\), we need to identify the perfect squares that divide each factorial and then count the number of such squares.
  1. **Prime Factorization of Factorials**:
     - For each \(k\), the prime factors of \(k!\) can be determined by summing the exponents of each prime factor in the factorization of \(k!\).
     - For example, the prime factorization of \(5!\) includes the primes 2 and 3, with exponents 1 and 1 respectively.
  2. **Perfect Squares as Divisors**:
     - A perfect square must have even exponents in its prime factorization.
     - For \(k!\), the perfect squares are those where each prime factor's exponent is even.
  3. **Counting Perfect Squares as Divisors**:
     - We need to count the number of perfect squares that divide each factorial from \(1!\) to \(9!\).
     - For \(k!\), the perfect squares are those where each prime factor's exponent is even.
  4. **Calculation**:
     - The number of perfect squares that divide \(1! \cdot 2! \cdot 3! \cdot \ldots \cdot 9!\) is given by the product of the number of perfect squares that divide each factorial.
     - This can be calculated by considering the exponents of each prime factor in the factorials and summing the exponents of the primes that divide each factorial.
  5. **Conclusion**:
     - After counting the number of perfect squares that divide each factorial, we find that there are 672 such perfect squares.
