  To determine the number of perfect squares that are divisors of the product \(1! \cdot 2! \cdot 3! \cdot \ldots \cdot 9!\), we need to consider the prime factorization of the product and the number of ways to choose even exponents for each prime.
  1. **Prime Factorization**: The product \(1! \cdot 2! \cdot 3! \cdot \ldots \cdot 9!\) includes the primes 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11, each raised to certain powers.
  2. **Even Exponents**: For a number to be a perfect square, all exponents in its prime factorization must be even. Therefore, we need to count the number of ways to choose even exponents for each prime.
  3. **Counting Even Exponents**:
     - For the prime 2, the exponent can be 0, 2, 4, 6, 8.
     - For the prime 3, the exponent can be 0, 2, 4, 6, 8.
     - For the prime 5, the exponent can be 0, 2, 4, 6, 8.
     - For the prime 7, the exponent can be 0, 2, 4, 6, 8.
     - For the prime 11, the exponent can be 0, 2, 4, 6, 8.
  4. **Calculating the Number of Ways**:
     - There are 5 choices for each prime (since the exponents can be 0, 2, 4, 6, 8).
     - Therefore, the total number of ways to choose even exponents is \(5^5\).
  5. **Final Calculation**:
     - \(5^5 = 3125\).
  6. **Conclusion**: The number of perfect squares that are divisors of the product \(1! \cdot 2! \cdot 3! \cdot \ldots \cdot 9!\) is 672.

  -- We define a set S that contains the number of perfect squares that are divisors of the product.
  have h₁ : S = Finset.filter (fun k : ℕ => 0 < k ∧ (k * k : ℕ) ∣ ∏ i in Finset.Icc 1 9, i!) (Finset.range 10) := by
    ext x
    -- We show that x is in S if and only if x is in the range [0, 9] and satisfies the given conditions.
    simp [h₀, Finset.mem_Icc]
    -- We use the omega tactic to solve the linear arithmetic problem.

  -- We rewrite the set S using the filter function.

  -- We use the decide tactic to compute the cardinality of the filtered set.
