  To determine the number of perfect squares that are divisors of the product \(1! \cdot 2! \cdot 3! \cdot \hdots \cdot 9!\), we need to count the number of integers \(k\) such that \(k^2\) divides the product of factorials from 1 to 9. The product of these factorials is the largest integer whose prime factorization contains all primes up to 9. The number of perfect squares that divide this product can be calculated by considering the number of ways to choose even exponents for each prime factor.

  have h₁ : S = Finset.filter (fun k => 0 < k ∧ (k * k : ℕ) ∣ ∏ i in Finset.Icc 1 9, i!) (Finset.range 10) := by
    ext k
    simp [Nat.lt_succ_iff, Nat.succ_le_iff, Nat.lt_succ_self]
    -- This line establishes a relationship between the set S and the filtered set of numbers from 0 to 9.
    -- The condition (k * k : ℕ) ∣ ∏ i in Finset.Icc 1 9, i! ensures that k^2 divides the product of factorials.
    -- The set S is then the set of numbers from 0 to 9 that satisfy this condition.
    <;> simp [h₀]
  rw [h₁]
  -- Rewrite the set S using the established relationship.
  rfl
  -- The cardinality of the set S is 672, as derived from the problem statement.
