  To determine the number of perfect squares that are divisors of the product \(1! \cdot 2! \cdot 3! \cdot \ldots \cdot 9!\), we need to count the number of integers \(k\) such that \(k^2\) divides \(1! \cdot 2! \cdot 3! \cdot \ldots \cdot 9!\). This can be achieved by filtering the range of numbers from 1 to 9, checking each number \(k\) and counting those that satisfy the condition \(k^2 \mid k \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \ldots \cdot 9!\).

    -- We need to show that k ∈ S if and only if k is in the range 1 to 9 and k^2 divides the product of factorials from 1 to 9.
    -- This is done by simplifying the membership condition using the given hypothesis h₀.
