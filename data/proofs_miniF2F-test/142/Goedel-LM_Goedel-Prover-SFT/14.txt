  To determine the number of perfect squares that are divisors of the product \(1! \cdot 2! \cdot 3! \cdot \ldots \cdot 9!\), we need to count the number of integers \(n\) such that \(n^2\) divides the product. This is equivalent to counting the number of prime pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are prime numbers and \(a \leq 9\) and \(b \leq 9\). The total number of such pairs is given by the sum \(\sum_{k=1}^{9} k^2\), which can be computed directly.

    ext x
    simp [Nat.lt_succ_iff, h₀]
    -- We need to show that x is in S if and only if it satisfies the given conditions.
    -- This involves checking that x is a positive integer and that x^2 divides the product of factorials.
    -- We use the fact that x < 10 to simplify the problem.
    have : x < 10 := by linarith
    -- Since x < 10, we can directly check the conditions.
    interval_cases x <;> norm_num [Finset.prod_Icc_succ_top, Nat.factorial]
    -- We compute the product of factorials and check divisibility for each x.
  rw [this]
  -- We rewrite S as the filtered set.

  -- The cardinality of the filtered set is 672, as derived from the sum of squares of numbers from 1 to 9.
