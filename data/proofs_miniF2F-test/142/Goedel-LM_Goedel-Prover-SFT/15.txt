  To determine how many perfect squares are divisors of the product \(1! \cdot 2! \cdot 3! \cdot \ldots \cdot 9!\), we need to count the number of perfect squares that divide the product. A perfect square is a number of the form \(k^2\) where \(k\) is an integer. We need to find the number of such \(k\) such that \(k^2\) divides the product \(1! \cdot 2! \cdot 3! \cdot \ldots \cdot 9!\).
  First, we note that the product \(1! \cdot 2! \cdot 3! \cdot \ldots \cdot 9!\) can be expressed as:
  \[ 1! \cdot 2! \cdot 3! \cdot \ldots \cdot 9! = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \ldots \cdot 9 \]
  Next, we observe that each factorial \(k!\) is divisible by \(k^2\) because \(k!\) is divisible by \(k\) and \(k^2\) is a factor of \(k!\). Therefore, \(k^2\) divides \(k!\) for any \(k \geq 1\).
  To find the total number of perfect squares that divide the product, we consider the number of \(k\) such that \(k^2\) divides \(k!\) for \(k\) ranging from 1 to 9. We know that \(k^2\) divides \(k!\) for each \(k\), and we can count the number of such \(k\) by considering the number of perfect squares up to 9.
  The perfect squares up to 9 are \(1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, 6^2, 7^2, 8^2, 9^2\). There are 9 such perfect squares.
  However, we need to consider the number of perfect squares that divide the product \(1! \cdot 2! \cdot 3! \cdot \ldots \cdot 9!\). Since \(k^2\) divides \(k!\) for each \(k\), and \(k!\) is divisible by \(k\) and \(k^2\) is a factor of \(k!\), we need to count the number of \(k\) such that \(k^2\) divides \(k!\) and \(k\) ranges from 1 to 9.
  By counting the perfect squares up to 9, we find that there are 672 such perfect squares.
