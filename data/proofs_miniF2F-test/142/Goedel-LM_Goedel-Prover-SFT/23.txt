  To determine how many perfect squares are divisors of the product \(1! \cdot 2! \cdot 3! \cdot \ldots \cdot 9!\), we need to count the number of integers \(k\) such that \(k^2\) divides the product. This is equivalent to finding the number of integers \(k\) such that \(k^2\) divides the product of the factorials from 1 to 9.
  Given the product \(1! \cdot 2! \cdot 3! \cdot \ldots \cdot 9!\), we can express it as:
  \[ \prod_{i=1}^{9} i! \]
  We need to find the number of integers \(k\) such that \(k^2\) divides this product. By the properties of factorials and the fact that \(k^2\) must be a divisor of the product, we can determine the number of such integers \(k\).
