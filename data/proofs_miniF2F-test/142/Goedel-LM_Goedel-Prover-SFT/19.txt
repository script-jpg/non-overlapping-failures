  To determine how many perfect squares are divisors of the product \(1! \cdot 2! \cdot 3! \cdot \ldots \cdot 9!\), we need to count the numbers \(k\) such that \(k^2\) divides the product of factorials from 1 to 9. The product of the factorials from 1 to 9 is \(9! = 362880\). We need to find the numbers \(k\) such that \(k^2\) divides 362880.
  First, we list the factorials from 1 to 9:
  \[ 1! = 1 \]
  \[ 2! = 2 \]
  \[ 3! = 6 \]
  \[ 4! = 24 \]
  \[ 5! = 120 \]
  \[ 6! = 720 \]
  \[ 7! = 5040 \]
  \[ 8! = 40320 \]
  \[ 9! = 362880 \]
  Next, we list the perfect squares that divide 362880:
  \[ 1^2 = 1 \]
  \[ 2^2 = 4 \]
  \[ 3^2 = 9 \]
  \[ 4^2 = 16 \]
  \[ 5^2 = 25 \]
  \[ 6^2 = 36 \]
  \[ 7^2 = 49 \]
  \[ 8^2 = 64 \]
  \[ 9^2 = 81 \]
  \[ 10^2 = 100 \]
  We need to count how many of these perfect squares divide 362880. We observe that the perfect squares from 1 to 9 do not divide 362880, and the perfect square 100 does not either. Therefore, the only perfect squares that divide 362880 are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, and 81.
  Thus, the cardinality of the set \(S\) of perfect squares that divide the product \(1! \cdot 2! \cdot 3! \cdot \ldots \cdot 9!\) is 672.
