Now we have established that $n \bmod 13 < 1342 \bmod 13$. The key insight is that we need to find the smallest positive integer $n$ that is a multiple of $1342$ and has a remainder less than $r$ when divided by $13$.

Let's think about how to approach this problem. We need to find the smallest $n$ such that:
1. $n \geq 1342$ (since it's a multiple of $1342$)
2. $n \bmod 13 < 1342 \bmod 1m{13}$

We can start by computing $1342 \bmod 13$:
$1342 \div 13 = 103$ remainder $3$, so $r = 3$.

We need to find the smallest $n$ such that $1342 \mid n$ and $n \bmod 13 < 3$.

Let's test $n = 1342$:
$1342 \bmod 13 = 3$, which does not satisfy our condition.

$n = 2 \cdot 1342 = 2684$:
$2684 \bmod 13 = 6$, which also does not satisfy our condition.

$n = 3 \cdot 1342 = 4026$:
$4026 \bmod 13 = 9$, which does not satisfy our condition.

We can see a pattern here. For $n = k \cdot 1342$, we have $n \bmod 13 = (k \cdot 1342 \bmod 13) = (k \cdot 3 \bmod 13)$. 

To get $n \bmod 13 < 3$, we need $k \cdot 3 \bmod 13 < 3$. This happens when $k \cdot 3 < 13$ or $k \cdot 3 > 13$ by a margin that keeps us below 3 when we take $n \bmod 13$.

Since $1342 \bmod 13 = 3$, we need $n \bmod 13 = 0, 1, 2$.

For $n \bmod 13 = 0$, we need $k \cdot 3 \bmod 13 = 0$, which happens when $k \bmod 13 = 0$.

For $n \bmod 13 = 1$, we need $k \cdot 3 \bmod 13 = 1$, which happens when $k \bmod 13 = 9$ (since $3 \cdot 9 = 27 = 2 \cdot 13 + 1$).

For $n \bmod 13 = 2$, we need $k \cdot 3 \bmod 13 = 2$, which happens when $k \bmod 13 = 8$ (since $3 \cdot 8 = 24 = 1 \cdot 13 + 11$... wait, let me recalculate.

For $k \cdot 3 \bmod 13 = 2$, we actually need $k \bmod 13 = 11$, since:
$3 \cdot 11 = 33 = 2 \cdot 13 + 7$... no, let me try another approach.

To solve $3k \bmod 13 = 2$, we need $3k = 13m + 2$ for some integer $m$.
Rearranging, $3k - 13m = 2$.

This is a linear Diophantine equation. The solutions will be of the form:
$k = k_0 + \frac{13}{\gcd(3,13)} t = k_0 + 13t$
$m = m_0 + \frac{3}{\gcd(3,13)} t = m_0 + 3t$

For $t \in \mathbb{Z}$.

Since $\gcd(3,13) = 1$, we need to find $k_0$ and $m_0$ such that $3k_0 - 13m_0 = 2$.

Testing small values, if $k_0 = 5$, then $3 \cdot 5 = 15$.
$15 - 13m_0 = 2 \implies 13m_0 = 13 \implies m_0 = 1$.

So $k_0 = 5$ and $m_0 = 1$ is a particular solution.
The general solution is $k = 5 + 13t$ and $m = 1 + 3t$.

We need the smallest positive $k$, so $t = 0$ gives $k = 5$ as the smallest positive solution.

But $k = 5$ gives $n = 5 \cdot 1342 = 6710$.

Let's check $6710 \bmod 13$:
$6710 \div 13 = 516$ remainder $2$, so $6710 \bmod 13 = 2$, which is indeed less than $3$.

So $6710$ is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of $1342$ and has a remainder less than $3$ when divided by $13$.

Let's complete the proof:

```tactics
omega
```

The `omega` tactic is powerful for solving integer arithmetic goals. It will automatically deduce that $6710 \leq n$ given the constraints $n \bmod 13 < 1342 \bmod 13$, $1342 \mid n$, and $0 < n$.

To recap why $6710$ is indeed the smallest such number:
1. $6710 = 5 \cdot 1342$, so it's a multiple of $1342$
2. $6710 \bmod 13 = 2 < 3$, which is $1342 \bmod 13$
3. For any smaller $n$ that satisfies these properties, it would contradict either the divisibility or the remainder condition

Thus, we have proved that $6710$ is the smallest positive integer with the given properties.
