  To determine the smallest positive integer that has the properties of being a multiple of 1342 and having a remainder smaller than \( r \) when divided by 13, we need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{1342} \) and \( n \equiv r \pmod{13} \). Given that \( r = 1342 \mod 13 \), we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find the smallest \( n \) that satisfies both congruences. The theorem states that since 1342 and 13 are coprime, there exists a unique solution modulo \( 1342 \times 13 \). We then need to check that 6710 is the smallest number that satisfies these conditions.
