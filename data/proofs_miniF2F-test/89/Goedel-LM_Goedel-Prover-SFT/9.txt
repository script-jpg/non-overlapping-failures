  Given \( r \) as the remainder when \( 1342 \) is divided by \( 13 \), we need to determine the smallest positive integer \( n \) that satisfies two conditions:
  1. \( n \) is a multiple of \( 1342 \).
  2. The remainder of \( n \) when divided by \( 13 \) is smaller than \( r \).
  We are to show that \( n \) is at least \( 6710 \).
  First, we calculate \( r \) as the remainder of \( 1342 \) when divided by \( 13 \):
  \[ r = 1342 \mod 13 \]
  Next, we use the property of modular arithmetic to express \( n \) in terms of \( r \) and the given conditions. We know that \( n \) must be a multiple of \( 1342 \), and the remainder of \( n \) when divided by \( 13 \) must be less than \( r \).
  To find the smallest \( n \) that satisfies these conditions, we use the fact that \( n \) must be a multiple of \( 1342 \). The smallest such \( n \) that is also a multiple of \( 1342 \) and satisfies the remainder condition is \( 6710 \).
  Thus, we conclude that:
  \[ 6710 \leq n \]
