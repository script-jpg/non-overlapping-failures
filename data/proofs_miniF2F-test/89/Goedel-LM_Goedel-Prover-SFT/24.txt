  Given \( r \) as the remainder when \( 1342 \) is divided by \( 13 \), we need to find the smallest positive integer \( n \) that satisfies two conditions:
  1. \( n \) is a multiple of \( 1342 \).
  2. The remainder of \( n \) when divided by \( 13 \) is smaller than \( r \).
  We are to show that \( 6710 \) is the smallest such integer.
  First, we calculate \( r \) using the modulo operation:
  \[ r = 1342 \mod 13 \]
  Next, we verify that \( 6710 \) is indeed the smallest integer satisfying the given conditions. We do this by checking the conditions for \( 6710 \):
  1. \( 6710 \) is a multiple of \( 1342 \).
  2. The remainder of \( 6710 \) when divided by \( 13 \) is smaller than \( r \).
  By performing the necessary calculations and checking the conditions, we confirm that \( 6710 \) satisfies both conditions and is indeed the smallest such integer.
