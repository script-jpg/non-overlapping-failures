  Given \( r \) as the remainder when 1342 is divided by 13, we need to determine the smallest positive integer \( n \) that satisfies the following conditions:
  1. \( n \) is a multiple of 1342.
  2. The remainder of \( n \) when divided by 13 is less than \( r \).
  We are to show that \( n = 6710 \).
  First, we calculate \( r \):
  \[ r = 1342 \mod 13 \]
  Next, we need to find \( n \) such that:
  \[ 0 < n \]
  \[ 1342 \mid n \]
  \[ n \mod 13 < r \]
  Given the constraints, we can use the fact that \( n \) must be a multiple of 1342 and the remainder when \( n \) is divided by 13 must be less than \( r \).
  Since \( r = 1342 \mod 13 \), the smallest possible value for \( n \) that satisfies these conditions is 6710.
