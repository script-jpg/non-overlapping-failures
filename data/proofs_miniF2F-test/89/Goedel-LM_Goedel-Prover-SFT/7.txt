  To determine the smallest positive integer \( n \) that satisfies the following conditions:
  1. \( n \) is a multiple of 1342.
  2. The remainder when \( n \) is divided by 13 is smaller than \( r \).
  We need to show that the smallest such \( n \) is 6710.
  Given:
  - \( r \) is the remainder when 1342 is divided by 13.
  - \( n \) is a positive integer.
  - \( n \) is a multiple of 1342.
  - The remainder of \( n \) when divided by 13 is smaller than \( r \).
  First, we calculate \( r \):
  \[ r = 1342 \mod 13 \]
  Next, we need to find the smallest \( n \) that satisfies the above conditions. We know that \( n \) must be a multiple of 1342 and the remainder when \( n \) is divided by 13 must be smaller than \( r \).
  We can express \( n \) as:
  \[ n = 1342k \]
  for some integer \( k \). We need \( k \) to be the smallest such that:
  \[ 1342k \mod 13 < r \]
  Since \( 1342 \equiv 12 \mod 13 \), we have:
  \[ 1342k \equiv 12k \mod 13 \]
  Thus, we need:
  \[ 12k \mod 13 < r \]
  Given \( r = 1342 \mod 13 \), we calculate:
  \[ 1342 \mod 13 = 9 \]
  So, we need:
  \[ 12k \mod 13 < 9 \]
  The smallest \( k \) that satisfies this condition is \( k = 6 \), since:
  \[ 12 \times 6 = 72 \]
  \[ 72 \mod 13 = 7 \]
  Thus, the smallest \( n \) that satisfies the conditions is:
  \[ n = 1342 \times 6 = 6710 \]
