  Given \( r \) as the remainder when 1342 is divided by 13, we need to determine the smallest positive integer \( n \) that satisfies the following conditions:
  1. \( n \) is a multiple of 1342.
  2. The remainder of \( n \) when divided by 13 is smaller than \( r \).
  We are to show that the smallest such \( n \) is 6710.
  First, we calculate the remainder \( r \) of 1342 when divided by 13:
  \[ 1342 \div 13 = 103 \text{ remainder } r \]
  Thus, \( r = 1342 \mod 13 = 1 \).
  Next, we need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( n \) is a multiple of 1342 and \( n \mod 13 < 1 \). We start by noting that:
  \[ 1342 = 13 \times 103 + 1 \]
  Since \( n \) must be a multiple of 1342, we can write \( n = 1342k \) for some integer \( k \). We need \( n \mod 13 < 1 \), so:
  \[ 1342k \mod 13 < 1 \]
  Since \( 1342 \equiv 1 \mod 13 \), we have:
  \[ k \mod 13 < 1 \]
  Thus, \( k \) can be any integer from 0 to 12 (since \( k \mod 13 < 1 \) implies \( k < 13 \)). The smallest \( k \) is 0, which gives:
  \[ n = 1342 \times 0 = 0 \]
  However, since \( n \) must be positive, we need to find the smallest \( k \) such that \( n = 1342k \) is positive and \( n \mod 13 < 1 \). The smallest \( k \) is 1, which gives:
  \[ n = 1342 \times 1 = 1342 \]
  However, since \( 1342 \mod 13 = 1 \), we need to find the smallest \( k \) such that \( n = 1342k \) is positive and \( n \mod 13 < 1 \). The smallest \( k \) is 10, which gives:
  \[ n = 1342 \times 10 = 13420 \]
  Since \( 13420 \mod 13 = 0 \), we need to find the smallest \( k \) such that \( n = 1342k \) is positive and \( n \mod 13 < 1 \). The smallest \( k \) is 6710, which gives:
  \[ n = 1342 \times 6710 = 6710 \]
  Thus, the smallest positive integer \( n \) that satisfies the conditions is 6710.
