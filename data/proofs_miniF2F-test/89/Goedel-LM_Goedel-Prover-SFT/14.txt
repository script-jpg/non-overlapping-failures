  Given \( r \) as the remainder when \( 1342 \) is divided by \( 13 \), we need to determine the smallest positive integer \( n \) that satisfies the following conditions:
  1. \( n \) is a multiple of \( 1342 \).
  2. The remainder of \( n \) when divided by \( 13 \) is smaller than \( r \).
  We are to show that \( n \) is at least \( 6710 \).
  First, we calculate \( r \) as \( 1342 \mod 13 \). Since \( 1342 \div 13 \) leaves a remainder of \( 6 \), we have \( r = 6 \).
  Next, we need \( n \) to be such that \( n \mod 13 < 6 \). We need to find the smallest \( n \) that satisfies this condition.
  We know that \( 1342 \times 2 = 2684 \). We can use \( 2684 \) as a candidate for \( n \) since it is a multiple of \( 1342 \) and its remainder when divided by \( 13 \) is \( 684 \mod 13 = 10 \), which is less than \( 6 \).
  Since \( 2684 \) is less than \( 6710 \), we conclude that \( n \) must be at least \( 6710 \).
