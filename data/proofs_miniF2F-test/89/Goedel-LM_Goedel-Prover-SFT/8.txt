  To determine the smallest positive integer that has the properties:
  1. It is a multiple of 1342.
  2. Its remainder when divided by 13 is smaller than \( r \).
  We need to show that the smallest such integer is 6710.
  Given:
  - \( r = 1342 \mod 13 \)
  - \( 0 < n \)
  - \( 1342 \mid n \)
  - \( n \mod 13 < r \)
  We will use these conditions to derive that \( n \geq 6710 \).
  -/
  -- Substitute the value of r from the given condition h₀ into the inequality.
  rw [h₀] at h₃
  -- Use the property that 1342 divides n to express n as a multiple of 1342.
  have := Nat.mod_add_div n 1342
  -- Use the omega tactic to solve the inequality involving n.
