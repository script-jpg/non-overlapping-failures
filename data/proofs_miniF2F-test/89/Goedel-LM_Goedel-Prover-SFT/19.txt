  Given \( r \) as the remainder when 1342 is divided by 13, we need to determine the smallest positive integer \( n \) that satisfies two conditions:
  1. \( n \) is a multiple of 1342.
  2. The remainder of \( n \) when divided by 13 is smaller than \( r \).
  We are to show that the smallest such \( n \) is 6710.
  First, we calculate \( r \):
  \[ r = 1342 \mod 13 \]
  Next, we verify that 6710 satisfies the conditions:
  1. \( 6710 \mod 1342 = 0 \) (since 6710 is a multiple of 1342).
  2. \( 6710 \mod 13 < r \) (since 6710 is less than 6720, which is the next multiple of 1342 greater than 6710).
  Finally, we show that any other number \( n \) satisfying the conditions must be at least 6710.
