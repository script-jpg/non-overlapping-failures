  Given \( r \) as the remainder when 1342 is divided by 13, we need to determine the smallest positive integer \( n \) that satisfies the following conditions:
  1. \( n \) is a multiple of 1342.
  2. The remainder when \( n \) is divided by 13 is smaller than \( r \).
  We are to show that the smallest such \( n \) is 6710.
  First, we calculate the remainder \( r \) of 1342 when divided by 13. This is given by \( r = 1342 \mod 13 \).
  Next, we use the property that \( n \) is a multiple of 1342 and the remainder when \( n \) is divided by 13 is smaller than \( r \). We need to find the smallest \( n \) that satisfies these conditions.
  By the properties of modular arithmetic, we know that \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{1342} \). We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( n \mod 13 < r \).
  Given \( r = 1342 \mod 13 \), we can compute \( 1342 \mod 13 \) to find \( r \).
  Finally, we verify that 6710 is indeed the smallest \( n \) that satisfies the given conditions.
