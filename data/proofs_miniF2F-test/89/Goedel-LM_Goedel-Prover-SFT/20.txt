  Given \( r \) as the remainder when \( 1342 \) is divided by \( 13 \), we need to determine the smallest positive integer \( n \) that satisfies the following conditions:
  1. \( n \) is a multiple of \( 1342 \).
  2. The remainder of \( n \) when divided by \( 13 \) is smaller than \( r \).
  We are to show that \( n \) is at least \( 6710 \).
  First, we calculate \( r \):
  \[ r = 1342 \mod 13 \]
  Next, we need to find the smallest \( n \) that satisfies the given conditions. We know that \( n \) must be a multiple of \( 1342 \). The least common multiple (LCM) of \( 1342 \) and \( 13 \) is \( 1342 \). We then verify that \( 1342 \mod 13 \) is indeed less than \( r \).
  Since \( 1342 \mod 13 = 10 \), we check that \( 10 < 1342 \mod 13 \). This condition is satisfied.
  Finally, we conclude that the smallest \( n \) that meets the criteria is \( 6710 \).
