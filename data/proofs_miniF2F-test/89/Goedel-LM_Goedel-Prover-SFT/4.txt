  Given \( r \) as the remainder when 1342 is divided by 13, we need to determine the smallest positive integer \( n \) that satisfies the following conditions:
  1. \( n \) is a multiple of 1342.
  2. The remainder of \( n \) when divided by 13 is smaller than \( r \).
  We need to show that the smallest such \( n \) is 6710.
  First, we calculate \( r \) as \( 1342 \mod 13 \). Then, we use the properties of modular arithmetic and the fact that \( n \) is a multiple of 1342 to find the smallest \( n \) that satisfies the given conditions.

  -- Substitute the value of `r` from the hypothesis `h₀` into `h₃`.
  rw [h₀] at h₃
  -- Use the property that if `1342` divides `n`, then `n % 13 = 0`.
  rw [← Nat.mod_add_div n 13] at h₂
  -- Use the `omega` tactic to solve the linear arithmetic problem.
