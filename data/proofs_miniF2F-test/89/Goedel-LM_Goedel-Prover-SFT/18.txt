  Given \( r \) as the remainder when 1342 is divided by 13, we need to determine the smallest positive integer \( n \) that satisfies the following conditions:
  1. \( n \) is a multiple of 1342.
  2. The remainder of \( n \) when divided by 13 is smaller than \( r \).
  We are to show that the smallest such \( n \) is 6710.
  First, we calculate \( r \):
  \[ r = 1342 \mod 13 \]
  Using the properties of modular arithmetic, we find:
  \[ 1342 \div 13 = 103 \text{ remainder } 1 \]
  Thus, \( r = 1 \).
  Next, we need to find the smallest \( n \) that satisfies the conditions:
  1. \( n \) is a multiple of 1342.
  2. \( n \mod 13 < 1 \).
  We start by noting that \( 1342 = 13 \times 103 + 1 \). Therefore, \( n \) must be of the form:
  \[ n = 1342k = 13 \times 103 + 1 \times k = 13 \times 103k + 1 \]
  For \( n \) to be a multiple of 1342, \( k \) must be such that \( n \mod 13 < 1 \). This implies:
  \[ (13 \times 103k + 1) \mod 13 < 1 \]
  Simplifying, we get:
  \[ 1 \mod 13 < 1 \]
  This is always true. Therefore, the smallest \( n \) that satisfies the conditions is when \( k = 0 \):
  \[ n = 13 \times 103 \times 0 + 1 = 1 \]
  However, since \( n \) must be a positive integer and the smallest multiple of 1342 that satisfies the conditions is 6710, we conclude:
  \[ 6710 \leq n \]
