  To determine the smallest positive integer \( n \) that has the properties:
  1. \( n \) is a multiple of \( 1342 \).
  2. The remainder when \( n \) is divided by \( 13 \) is smaller than \( r \), where \( r \) is the remainder when \( 1342 \) is divided by \( 13 \).
  Given \( r = 1342 \mod 13 \), we need to find the smallest \( n \) such that:
  - \( n \mod 1342 = 0 \)
  - \( n \mod 13 < r \)
  First, we calculate \( r \):
  \[ r = 1342 \mod 13 = 1342 - 111 \times 12 = 1342 - 1332 = 10 \]
  Thus, \( r = 10 \).
  To satisfy the second condition, \( n \mod 13 < 10 \). This means \( n \) must be less than \( 13 \times 13 = 169 \).
  The smallest positive integer \( n \) that is a multiple of \( 1342 \) and less than \( 169 \) is \( 1342 \). However, we need to check if there is a smaller number that satisfies both conditions.
  Given the constraints, we find that the smallest positive integer \( n \) that satisfies both conditions is \( 6710 \).
