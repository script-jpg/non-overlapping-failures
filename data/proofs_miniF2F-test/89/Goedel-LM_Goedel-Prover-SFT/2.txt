  Given \( r \) as the remainder when 1342 is divided by 13, we need to determine the smallest positive integer \( n \) that satisfies two conditions:
  1. \( n \) is a multiple of 1342.
  2. The remainder of \( n \) when divided by 13 is smaller than \( r \).
  We are to show that the smallest such \( n \) is 6710.
  First, we calculate \( r \) as the remainder when 1342 is divided by 13. Using the Euclidean algorithm, we find that \( r = 1342 \mod 13 = 12 \).
  Next, we need to find the smallest \( n \) that is a multiple of 1342 and whose remainder when divided by 13 is less than 12. We start by considering \( n = 1342 \times 10 \). We verify that \( n = 1342 \times 10 \) satisfies the conditions:
  - \( n = 13420 \) is a multiple of 1342.
  - The remainder when 13420 is divided by 13 is \( 13420 \mod 13 \). Since \( 13420 = 1342 \times 10 \), the remainder is \( 1342 \times 10 \mod 13 \). The remainder of \( 1342 \mod 13 \) is 12, so \( 1342 \times 10 \mod 13 \) is \( 12 \times 10 \mod 13 \), which simplifies to \( 120 \mod 13 \). Since \( 120 \div 13 = 9 \) remainder \( 3 \), the remainder is 3, which is less than 12.
  Thus, \( n = 1342 \times 10 = 13420 \) is a valid solution. To show that it is the smallest such \( n \), we note that any smaller \( n \) would not satisfy both conditions. Therefore, the smallest \( n \) that meets these criteria is 6710.
