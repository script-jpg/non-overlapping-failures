  Given \( r \) as the remainder when 1342 is divided by 13, we need to determine the smallest positive integer \( n \) that satisfies two properties:
  1. \( n \) is a multiple of 1342.
  2. The remainder when \( n \) is divided by 13 is smaller than \( r \).
  We are to show that the smallest such \( n \) is 6710.
  First, we compute \( r \) by taking the remainder of 1342 when divided by 13. We find that \( r = 1342 \mod 13 = 12 \).
  Next, we need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( n \mod 13 < 12 \) and \( n \) is a multiple of 1342. We start by noting that 1342 can be factored into \( 1342 = 11 \times 122 \).
  To satisfy the condition \( n \mod 13 < 12 \), we can choose \( n = 6710 \). We verify that 6710 is indeed a multiple of 1342 and that its remainder when divided by 13 is less than 12.
