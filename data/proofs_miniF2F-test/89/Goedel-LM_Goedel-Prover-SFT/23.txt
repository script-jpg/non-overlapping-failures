  Given \( r \) as the remainder when 1342 is divided by 13, we need to determine the smallest positive integer \( n \) that satisfies the following conditions:
  1. \( n \) is a multiple of 1342.
  2. The remainder of \( n \) when divided by 13 is smaller than \( r \).
  We are to show that \( n \) is at least 6710.
  First, we calculate \( r \):
  \[ r = 1342 \mod 13 \]
  Next, we use the properties of modular arithmetic to derive the smallest \( n \). Since \( n \) is a multiple of 1342, we can write \( n \) as:
  \[ n = 1342k \]
  for some integer \( k \). Given that \( n \mod 13 < r \), we have:
  \[ 1342k \mod 13 < r \]
  We need to find the smallest \( k \) such that \( 1342k \mod 13 < r \). By calculating \( 1342 \mod 13 \), we find:
  \[ 1342 \mod 13 = 12 \]
  Thus, we need \( k \) such that:
  \[ 12k \mod 13 < 12 \]
  The smallest \( k \) that satisfies this condition is \( k = 6710 \mod 13 \), since:
  \[ 6710 \mod 13 = 12 \]
  Therefore, the smallest \( n \) that satisfies the given conditions is:
  \[ n = 1342 \times 6710 \mod 13 \]
  Since \( 1342 \times 6710 \mod 13 = 12 \), we have:
  \[ n = 6710 \]
  Thus, the smallest positive integer \( n \) that satisfies the conditions is 6710.
