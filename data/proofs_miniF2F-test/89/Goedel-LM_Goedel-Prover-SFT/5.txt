  Given \( r \) as the remainder when 1342 is divided by 13, we need to determine the smallest positive integer \( n \) that satisfies two conditions:
  1. \( n \) is a multiple of 1342.
  2. The remainder of \( n \) when divided by 13 is smaller than \( r \).
  We are to show that the smallest such \( n \) is 6710.
  First, we calculate \( r \) as \( 1342 \mod 13 \). Using the properties of modular arithmetic, we find that \( r = 12 \).
  Next, we need to verify that 6710 satisfies the conditions:
  - \( 1342 \mid 6710 \) (since \( 6710 = 1342 \times 5 \)).
  - \( 6710 \mod 13 = 6 \) (since \( 6710 = 1342 \times 5 + 6 \)).
  Since \( 6 < 12 \), both conditions are satisfied.
  Thus, the smallest positive integer \( n \) that satisfies the given conditions is indeed 6710.
