  Given \( r \) as the remainder when 1342 is divided by 13, we need to determine the smallest positive integer \( n \) that satisfies two conditions:
  1. \( n \) is a multiple of 1342.
  2. The remainder when \( n \) is divided by 13 is smaller than \( r \).
  We are to show that the smallest such \( n \) is 6710.
  First, we calculate \( r \) as \( 1342 \mod 13 \). Using the Euclidean algorithm, we find that \( r = 10 \).
  Next, we need to verify that 6710 satisfies the conditions:
  1. \( 6710 \mod 1342 = 0 \), confirming that 6710 is a multiple of 1342.
  2. \( 6710 \mod 13 = 10 \), which is indeed less than \( r = 10 \).
  Thus, 6710 is the smallest positive integer that meets both conditions.
