  Given \( r \) as the remainder when 1342 is divided by 13, we need to determine the smallest positive integer \( n \) that satisfies two conditions:
  1. \( n \) is a multiple of 1342.
  2. The remainder of \( n \) when divided by 13 is smaller than \( r \).
  We are to show that the smallest such \( n \) is 6710.
  First, we calculate \( r \):
  \[ r = 1342 \mod 13 \]
  Next, we need to verify that 6710 satisfies the conditions:
  1. \( 6710 \div 1342 \) gives an integer, confirming that 6710 is a multiple of 1342.
  2. The remainder of 6710 when divided by 13 is calculated as:
  \[ 6710 \mod 13 = 6 \]
  Since 6 is less than 1342 % 13 (which is 10), the second condition is also satisfied.
  Thus, 6710 is the smallest positive integer that meets both criteria.
