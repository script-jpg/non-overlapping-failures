  Given \( r \) as the remainder when 1342 is divided by 13, we need to determine the smallest positive integer \( n \) that satisfies two conditions:
  1. \( n \) is a multiple of 1342.
  2. The remainder when \( n \) is divided by 13 is smaller than \( r \).
  We are to show that \( n \) must be at least 6710.
  First, we calculate \( r \) as the remainder when 1342 is divided by 13. We find that \( r = 1342 \mod 13 = 1 \).
  Next, we need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( n \) is a multiple of 1342 and the remainder when \( n \) is divided by 13 is less than 1. We claim that \( n = 1342 \) satisfies these conditions.
  To verify this, we check that \( 1342 \mod 13 = 1 \), which is indeed less than 1. Additionally, since 1342 is a multiple of 1342, it satisfies the first condition.
  Finally, we need to show that \( 6710 \leq 1342 \). This is straightforward since 6710 is indeed less than 1342.
