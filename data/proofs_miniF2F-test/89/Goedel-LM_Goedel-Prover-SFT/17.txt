  Given \( r \) as the remainder when 1342 is divided by 13, we need to determine the smallest positive integer \( n \) that satisfies the following conditions:
  1. \( n \) is a multiple of 1342.
  2. The remainder when \( n \) is divided by 13 is smaller than \( r \).
  We are to show that the smallest such \( n \) is 6710.
  First, we calculate \( r \):
  \[ r = 1342 \mod 13 \]
  Next, we need to verify that 6710 satisfies the given conditions. We check that 6710 is a multiple of 1342 and that its remainder when divided by 13 is less than \( r \).
