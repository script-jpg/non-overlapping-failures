  We need to show that the smallest positive integer \( n \) for which \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) share a common factor greater than 1 is 41, where \( p(n) = n^2 - n + 41 \).
  1. Assume for contradiction that \( n < 41 \).
  2. For \( n < 41 \), we evaluate \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) and check if they share a common factor greater than 1.
  3. By evaluating \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) for \( n < 41 \), we find that none of these pairs share a common factor greater than 1.
  4. This contradicts the assumption that \( n < 41 \) is the smallest such \( n \).
  5. Therefore, \( n \) must be at least 41.
