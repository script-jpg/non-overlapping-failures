  We need to show that the smallest positive integer \( n \) for which \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) share a common factor greater than 1 is 41. Given the polynomial \( p(n) = n^2 - n + 41 \), we will verify that for \( n = 41 \), the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( p(41) \) and \( p(42) \) is greater than 1, and for any \( n < 41 \), the gcd of \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) is not greater than 1.
