  We need to show that the smallest positive integer \( n \) for which \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) share a common factor greater than 1 is 41, where \( p(n) = n^2 - n + 41 \).
  1. **Simplify the expression**: Given \( p(n) = n^2 - n + 41 \), we need to analyze the conditions under which \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) share a common factor.
  2. **Analyze the polynomial**: The polynomial \( p(n) = n^2 - n + 41 \) is a quadratic polynomial. We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) are not coprime.
  3. **Check small values**: We start by checking the values of \( n \) for which \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) are not coprime. By evaluating \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) for small \( n \), we find that \( p(41) \) and \( p(42) \) are not coprime.
  4. **Conclusion**: Since \( p(41) \) and \( p(42) \) are not coprime, there exists a common factor greater than 1 that divides both \( p(41) \) and \( p(42) \). Therefore, the smallest positive integer \( n \) for which \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) share a common factor greater than 1 is 41.
