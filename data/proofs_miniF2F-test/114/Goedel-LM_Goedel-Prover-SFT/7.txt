  To solve the problem, we need to show that for the polynomial \( p(n) = n^2 - n + 41 \), the smallest positive integer \( n \) for which \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) share a common factor greater than 1 is at least 41. We will use the given conditions and properties of the greatest common divisor to derive this result.
  -/
  -- Simplify the given conditions and expressions.
  simp_all [h₀]
  -- Use contradiction to show that n must be at least 41.
  apply le_of_not_lt
  intro h
  -- If n < 41, we will show that the gcd condition cannot hold.
  have h' : n < 41 := by linarith
  -- Use interval_cases to check specific values of n and show that the gcd condition fails for any of these values.
  interval_cases n <;> simp_all [Nat.gcd_eq_right]
