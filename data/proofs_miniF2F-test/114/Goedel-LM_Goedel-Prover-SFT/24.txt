  We need to show that for the polynomial \( p(n) = n^2 - n + 41 \), the smallest positive integer \( n \) for which \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) share a common factor greater than 1 is 41. We will use contradiction to prove this.
  1. Assume \( n < 41 \).
  2. For each \( n \) in the range \( 0 \leq n < 41 \), we will compute \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \).
  3. We will show that for each \( n \) in this range, the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) is 1.
  4. This contradicts the given condition that the gcd of \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) is greater than 1.
  5. Therefore, \( n \) must be at least 41.
