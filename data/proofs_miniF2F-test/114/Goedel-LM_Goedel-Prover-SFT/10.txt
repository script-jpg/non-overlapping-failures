  We need to show that for the polynomial \( p(n) = n^2 - n + 41 \), the smallest positive integer \( n \) for which \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) share a common factor greater than 1 is 41. We will proceed by contradiction.
  Assume for contradiction that there exists a positive integer \( n \) less than 41 such that \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) share a common factor greater than 1. We will check the values of \( n \) from 1 to 40 and show that none of these values satisfy the condition.
