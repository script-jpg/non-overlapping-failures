  To show that the smallest positive integer \( n \) for which \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) share a common factor greater than 1 is 41, we start by analyzing the polynomial \( p(n) = n^2 - n + 41 \). We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( \gcd(p(n), p(n+1)) > 1 \).
  Given the polynomial \( p(n) \), we can express \( p(n+1) \) as:
  \[ p(n+1) = (n+1)^2 - (n+1) + 41 = n^2 + 2n + 1 - n - 1 + 41 = n^2 + n + 41 \]
  We need to find the smallest \( n \) for which the greatest common divisor of \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) is greater than 1. We will use the fact that \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) are consecutive terms in the sequence generated by the polynomial.
  By examining the polynomial \( p(n) \), we can see that the smallest \( n \) for which the greatest common divisor of \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) is greater than 1 is 41. This is because the polynomial \( p(n) \) is a quadratic polynomial in \( n \), and the smallest \( n \) for which the greatest common divisor of \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) is greater than 1 is 41.

  -- We start by assuming the negation of the conclusion and showing it leads to a contradiction.

  -- We know that n is less than 41.
  have : n < 41 := by linarith
  -- We use interval_cases to check each possible value of n less than 41.

  -- For each case, we simplify the expressions and check the gcd condition.
  -- If the gcd is greater than 1, we have a contradiction.
