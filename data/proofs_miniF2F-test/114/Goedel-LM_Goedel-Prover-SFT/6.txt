  We need to show that the smallest positive integer \( n \) for which \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) share a common factor greater than 1 is 41, where \( p(n) = n^2 - n + 41 \).
  1. **Understanding the Polynomial**: The polynomial \( p(n) = n^2 - n + 41 \) is a quadratic polynomial in \( n \).
  2. **Prime Factorization**: We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) share a common factor greater than 1.
  3. **Checking Values**: We will check the values of \( n \) from 41 onwards to find the smallest \( n \) for which \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) share a common factor greater than 1.
  4. **Verification**: By evaluating \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) for \( n \geq 41 \), we will confirm that \( n = 41 \) is the smallest value that satisfies the condition.

  -- The contradiction arises from the fact that the gcd of p(n) and p(n+1) is not greater than 1 for n < 41.
