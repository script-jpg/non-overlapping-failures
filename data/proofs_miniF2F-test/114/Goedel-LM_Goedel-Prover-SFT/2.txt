  We need to show that for the polynomial \( p(n) = n^2 - n + 41 \), there exists a smallest positive integer \( n \) such that \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) share a common factor greater than 1, and that \( n \) is 41.
  1. **Define the polynomial**: Let \( p(n) = n^2 - n + 41 \).
  2. **Condition on common factors**: We are given that \( 1 < \gcd(p(n), p(n+1)) \) for some \( n \).
  3. **Substitute \( n = 41 \)**: Calculate \( p(41) \) and \( p(42) \).
  4. **Verify the conditions**: Check that \( p(41) \) and \( p(42) \) share a common factor greater than 1.
  5. **Minimality**: Prove that no smaller \( n \) satisfies the condition.
