  To show that the smallest positive integer \( n \) for which \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) share a common factor greater than 1 is 41, we start by analyzing the polynomial \( p(n) = n^2 - n + 41 \). We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) are not coprime.
  1. **Factorization of \( p(n) \)**:
     \[
     p(n) = n^2 - n + 41 = (n - 41)(n - 1)
     \]
     Thus, the prime factors of \( p(n) \) are \( n - 41 \) and \( n - 1 \).
  2. **Condition for Common Factor**:
     For \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) to share a common factor greater than 1, \( n - 41 \) and \( n - 1 \) must be coprime. This implies that \( n \) must not be a multiple of 41 or 1.
  3. **Checking for Smallest \( n \)**:
     We need to check if there is a smaller \( n \) that satisfies the condition. By testing values, we find that \( n = 41 \) is the smallest value that makes \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) share a common factor greater than 1.
