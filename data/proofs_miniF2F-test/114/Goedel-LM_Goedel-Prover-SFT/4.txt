  We need to show that for the polynomial \( p(n) = n^2 - n + 41 \), the smallest positive integer \( n \) for which \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) share a common factor greater than 1 is 41.
  1. **Understanding the Polynomial**: The polynomial \( p(n) = n^2 - n + 41 \) is a quadratic polynomial in \( n \).
  2. **Common Factors**: We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) share a common factor greater than 1.
  3. **Verification**: We will verify that for \( n = 41 \), the polynomial \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) share a common factor greater than 1.
