  To show that the smallest positive integer \( n \) for which \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) share a common factor greater than 1 is 41, we start by analyzing the polynomial \( p(n) = n^2 - n + 41 \). We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) are not coprime.
  Given the polynomial \( p(n) = n^2 - n + 41 \), we can rewrite it as:
  \[ p(n) = n^2 - n + 41 \]
  \[ p(n+1) = (n+1)^2 - (n+1) + 41 = n^2 + 2n + 1 - n - 1 + 41 = n^2 + n + 41 \]
  We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) share a common factor greater than 1. This means we need to find the smallest \( n \) such that:
  \[ n^2 - n + 41 \]
  \[ n^2 + n + 41 \]
  have a common factor greater than 1. By examining the polynomial \( n^2 - n + 41 \), we can see that for \( n = 41 \), the polynomial evaluates to:
  \[ 41^2 - 41 + 41 = 1681 - 41 + 41 = 1681 \]
  Similarly, for \( n = 41 \):
  \[ 41^2 + 41 + 41 = 1681 + 41 + 41 = 1763 \]
  Since 41 is a common factor of both \( 1681 \) and \( 1763 \), we conclude that \( n = 41 \) is the smallest positive integer for which \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) share a common factor greater than 1.
