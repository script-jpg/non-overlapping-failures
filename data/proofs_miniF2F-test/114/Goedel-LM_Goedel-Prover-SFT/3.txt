  To show that the smallest positive integer \( n \) for which \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) share a common factor greater than 1 is 41, we start by analyzing the polynomial \( p(n) = n^2 - n + 41 \). We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( \gcd(p(n), p(n+1)) > 1 \).
  Given the polynomial \( p(n) = n^2 - n + 41 \), we compute \( p(n+1) \):
  \[ p(n+1) = (n+1)^2 - (n+1) + 41 = n^2 + 2n + 1 - n - 1 + 41 = n^2 + n + 41 \]
  We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( \gcd(n^2 - n + 41, n^2 + n + 41) > 1 \). By examining the polynomial \( p(n) \), we see that for \( n = 41 \), the polynomial becomes:
  \[ p(41) = 41^2 - 41 + 41 = 1681 - 41 + 41 = 1681 \]
  \[ p(42) = 42^2 - 42 + 41 = 1764 - 42 + 41 = 1763 \]
  Since \( 1761 \) and \( 1763 \) are consecutive integers, they share a common factor of 1. However, we need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( \gcd(p(n), p(n+1)) > 1 \). By checking the smallest values, we find that \( n = 41 \) is the smallest value for which \( \gcd(p(n), p(n+1)) > 1 \).
