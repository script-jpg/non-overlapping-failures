  We need to show that the smallest positive integer \( n \) for which \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) share a common factor greater than 1 is 41. The polynomial \( p(n) = n^2 - n + 41 \) is given. We will prove this by contradiction.
  Assume for contradiction that there exists a positive integer \( n \) less than 41 such that \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) share a common factor greater than 1. We will check each \( n \) from 1 to 40 and show that this leads to a contradiction.
