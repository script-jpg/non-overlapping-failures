  We need to show that the smallest positive integer \( n \) for which \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) share a common factor greater than 1 is 41, where \( p(n) = n^2 - n + 41 \).
  1. **Initial Conditions**:
     - Given \( p(n) = n^2 - n + 41 \), we know \( p(n) \) is a quadratic polynomial.
     - We are given that \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) share a common factor greater than 1.
  2. **Goal**:
     - We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) are not coprime.
  3. **Verification**:
     - We verify that for \( n = 41 \), the polynomial \( p(41) \) and \( p(42) \) share a common factor greater than 1.
     - We show that for any \( n < 41 \), the polynomial \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) are coprime.
