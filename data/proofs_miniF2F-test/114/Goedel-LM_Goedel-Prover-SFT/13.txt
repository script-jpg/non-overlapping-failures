  Euler discovered that the polynomial \( p(n) = n^2 - n + 41 \) yields prime numbers for many small positive integer values of \( n \). We need to determine the smallest positive integer \( n \) for which \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) share a common factor greater than 1. We will show that this smallest \( n \) is 41.

  -- Simplify the given conditions using the polynomial definition.
  simp only [h₀] at h₁
  -- Use contraposition to show that if n < 41, then the greatest common divisor is not greater than 1.
  contrapose! h₁
  -- Use interval cases to check each value of n from 1 to 40.
