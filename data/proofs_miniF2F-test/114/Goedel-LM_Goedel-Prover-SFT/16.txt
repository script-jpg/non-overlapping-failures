  We need to show that the smallest positive integer \( n \) for which \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) share a common factor greater than 1 is 41, where \( p(n) = n^2 - n + 41 \).
  1. Assume for contradiction that \( n < 41 \).
  2. Evaluate \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) for \( n < 41 \).
  3. Use the fact that \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) are consecutive integers, which implies they share a common factor greater than 1.
  4. This leads to a contradiction because the greatest common divisor of two consecutive integers cannot be greater than 1.
  5. Therefore, \( n \) must be at least 41.
