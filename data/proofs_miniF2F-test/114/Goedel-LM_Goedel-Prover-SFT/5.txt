  We need to show that the smallest positive integer \( n \) for which \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) share a common factor greater than 1 is 41, where \( p(n) = n^2 - n + 41 \).
  1. **Understanding the Polynomial**: The polynomial \( p(n) = n^2 - n + 41 \) is a quadratic polynomial in \( n \).
  2. **Common Factor Condition**: We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( \gcd(p(n), p(n+1)) > 1 \).
  3. **Verification**: We verify that for \( n = 41 \), the polynomial \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) share a common factor greater than 1.
  4. **Minimality**: We show that no smaller \( n \) satisfies the condition by checking the values of \( n \) from 0 to 40 and verifying the gcd condition.
