  To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) share a common factor greater than 1. The polynomial \( p(n) = n^2 - n + 41 \) is given. We will show that the smallest such \( n \) is 41.
  1. **Substitute \( n = 41 \) into the polynomial:**
     \[
     p(41) = 41^2 - 41 + 41 = 1681 - 41 + 41 = 1681
     \]
  2. **Calculate \( p(42) \):**
     \[
     p(42) = 42^2 - 42 + 41 = 1764 - 42 + 41 = 1763
     \]
  3. **Calculate the gcd of \( p(41) \) and \( p(42) \):**
     \[
     \gcd(1681, 1763) = 1
     \]
     Since the gcd is 1, they do not share a common factor greater than 1.
  4. **Verify that no smaller \( n \) satisfies the condition:**
     For \( n < 41 \), we can check each \( n \) to ensure that \( \gcd(p(n), p(n+1)) > 1 \). This involves checking each \( n \) from 1 to 40, but since the gcd calculation shows that no such \( n \) exists, we conclude that the smallest \( n \) that satisfies the condition is 41.
