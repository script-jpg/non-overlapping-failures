  Euler discovered that the polynomial \( p(n) = n^2 - n + 41 \) yields prime numbers for many small positive integer values of \( n \). What is the smallest positive integer \( n \) for which \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) share a common factor greater than 1? Show that it is 41.
  To prove this, we start by analyzing the polynomial \( p(n) = n^2 - n + 41 \). We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) share a common factor greater than 1.
  1. **Understanding the Polynomial**: The polynomial \( p(n) = n^2 - n + 41 \) is a quadratic polynomial in \( n \).
  2. **Common Factor Condition**: We need to find \( n \) such that \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) share a common factor greater than 1.
  3. **Verification**: We verify that \( n = 41 \) satisfies the condition by checking the gcd of \( p(41) \) and \( p(42) \).
