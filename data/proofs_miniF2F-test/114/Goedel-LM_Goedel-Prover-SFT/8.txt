 Euler discovered that the polynomial \( p(n) = n^2 - n + 41 \) yields prime numbers for many small positive integer values of \( n \). We need to find the smallest positive integer \( n \) for which \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) share a common factor greater than 1. We will show that this smallest \( n \) is 41.

  -- We use a proof by contradiction. Assume \( n \) is less than 41.

  -- We will check each \( n \) from 1 to 40 and show that \( p(n) \) and \( p(n+1) \) do not share a common factor greater than 1.
