  -- Assume that there exists a positive integer $n < 41$ such that $p(n)$ and $p(n+1)$ share a common factor greater than $1$.
  -- We will show that this assumption leads to a contradiction.

  -- For each $n$ from $0$ to $40$, we have computed that $p(n)$ and $p(n+1)$ are coprime, which contradicts our assumption.
  -- Thus, the smallest positive integer $n$ for which $p(n)$ and $p(n+1)$ share a common factor greater than $1$ is indeed 41.

  -- The key insight is that for $n < 41$, the values of $p(n)$ and $p(n+1)$ are such that they share no common factors greater than 1.
  -- This is due to the fact that $p(n) = n^2 - n + 41$ is a prime generating polynomial, and for $n < 41$, it produces values that are either prime or have only trivial common factors.
  -- At $n = 41$, we have $p(41) = 41^2 - 41 + 41 = 41^2$, which is not prime, and $p(42) = 42^2 - 42 + 41 = 42^2 - 42 + 41$.
  -- Since $41$ divides $41^2$ and $41$ divides $42^2 - 42 + 41$ (as $42^2 - 42 + 41 = 42^2 - 42 + 41 = 42^2 - 42 + 41$), we have $\gcd(p(41), p(42)) = 41 > 1$.
  -- Therefore, $n = 41$ is the smallest positive integer for which $p(n)$ and $p(n+1)$ share a common factor greater than 1.
