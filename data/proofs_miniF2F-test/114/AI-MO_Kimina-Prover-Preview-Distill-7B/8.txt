-- We prove that the smallest positive integer $n$ for which $p(n)$ and $p(n+1)$ share a common factor greater than $1$ is 41.
  by_contra h
  -- Assume that there exists such $n < 41$.
  push_neg at h
  -- Then $n \leq 40$.
  replace h : n ≤ 40 := by omega
  -- We check each positive integer $n \leq 40$ and show that $p(n)$ and $p(n+1)$ are coprime.
  interval_cases n <;> simp [h₀] at h₁ <;> contradiction
  -- Hence, we have proved that the smallest positive integer $n$ for which $p(n)$ and $p(n+1)$ share a common factor greater than $1$ is 41.
