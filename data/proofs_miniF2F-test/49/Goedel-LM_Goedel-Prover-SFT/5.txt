  To show that \( f(1) = 9 \) for the function \( f(x) = 5x + 4 \), we proceed as follows:
  1. Substitute \( x = 1 \) into the function \( f(x) \).
  2. Calculate \( f(1) \) using the definition of \( f \).
  3. Verify that the result is indeed 9.

  -- Substitute \( x = 1 \) into the function \( f(x) \) and simplify using the definition of \( f \).
  simp [h₀, mul_one, mul_zero, add_zero]
  -- The `simp` tactic simplifies the expression using the definition of \( f \) and known properties of multiplication and addition.
  -- Specifically, it simplifies \( f(1) \) to \( 5 \cdot 1 + 4 \), which equals 9.
