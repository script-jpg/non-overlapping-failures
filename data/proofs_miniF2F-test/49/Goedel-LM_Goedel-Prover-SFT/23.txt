  To show that \( f(1) = 9 \) for the function \( f(x) = 5x + 4 \), we substitute \( x = 1 \) into the function and simplify the expression. Specifically, we compute \( f(1) = 5 \cdot 1 + 4 \). This results in \( 5 + 4 = 9 \), confirming that \( f(1) = 9 \).

  -- Substitute x = 1 into the function f(x) = 5x + 4
  have h₁ := h₀ 1
  -- Simplify the expression 5 * 1 + 4 to get the final result
  norm_num at h₁
  -- The simplified expression matches the desired result
