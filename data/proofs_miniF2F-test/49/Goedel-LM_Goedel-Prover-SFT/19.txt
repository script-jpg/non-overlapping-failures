  We need to show that for the function \( f(x) = 5x + 4 \), the value \( f(1) \) is 9. To do this, we substitute \( x = 1 \) into the function and simplify the expression.
  1. Substitute \( x = 1 \) into \( f(x) \):
     \[
     f(1) = 5 \cdot 1 + 4
     \]
  2. Perform the multiplication:
     \[
     5 \cdot 1 = 5
     \]
  3. Add 4 to the result:
     \[
     5 + 4 = 9
     \]
  Thus, \( f(1) = 9 \).
