  Given the function \( f(x) = 5x + 4 \), we need to determine \( f(1) \). By substituting \( x = 1 \) into the function, we get:
  \[ f(1) = 5 \cdot 1 + 4 = 5 + 4 = 9 \]
  Thus, the value of \( f(1) \) is indeed 9.

  -- Substitute x = 1 into the function f(x) = 5x + 4
  have h₁ := h₀ 1
  -- Simplify the expression to get the final result
  simp_all
  -- The simplified expression should now be 9, which is the desired result
