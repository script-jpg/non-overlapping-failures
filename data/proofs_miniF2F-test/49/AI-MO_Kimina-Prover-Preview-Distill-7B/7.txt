In this proof, we're given a function $f(x) = 5x + 4$ and need to find $f(1)$. 

1. The first step is to substitute $x = 1$ into the function definition. By the property $h₀ : ∀ x, f x = 5 * x + 4$, we can specialize to $x = 1$ to get $f(1) = 5 * 1 + 4$.

2. After substitution, we compute $5 * 1 + 4 = 5 + 4 = 9$ using Lean's `norm_num` tactic, which is powerful for solving arithmetic goals.

This is a direct computation proof where we apply the function definition and evaluate the expression. The answer is indeed 9.
