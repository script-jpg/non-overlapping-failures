```

This proof is straightforward because it directly applies the definition of $f$ given in the hypothesis `h₀`. The `calc` block is used to show a chain of equalities. First, it applies the hypothesis `h₀` with `x = 1` to rewrite `f 1` as `5 * 1 + 4`. Then, the `norm_num` tactic is used to compute the arithmetic expression `5 * 1 + 4` and verify it equals `9`.

Therefore, $f(1) = 5 \cdot 1 + 4 = 9$.
