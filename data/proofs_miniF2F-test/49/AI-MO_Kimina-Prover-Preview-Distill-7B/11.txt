In this proof, we are given a function $f(x) = 5x + 4$ and need to find $f(1)$. 

1. First, we apply the definition of the function to $x = 1$. By the definition $f(x) = 5x + 4$, we substitute $x = 1$ to get $f(1) = 5 \cdot 1 + 4$.
2. Then we perform the arithmetic calculation: $5 \cdot 1 + 4 = 5 + 4 = 9$.
3. Therefore, $f(1) = 9$.

The Lean proof formalizes these steps directly:
- The `rw [h₀]` tactic rewrites $f$ using the given hypothesis that $f(x) = 5x + 4$ for all $x$.
- After rewriting, the goal becomes to prove that $5 \cdot 1 + 4 = 9$.
- The `norm_num` tactic is powerful enough to compute this arithmetic goal automatically.

This is a straightforward application of function evaluation and arithmetic computation, demonstrating how Lean can handle basic calculations once the function's definition is provided.
