This completes the proof that $f(1) = 9$ for the function $f(x) = 5x + 4$. The key insight is that to find the value of a function at a specific point, we substitute that point into the function's formula. Here, substituting $x = 1$ into $f(x) = 5x + 4$ gives $f(1) = 5 \cdot 1 + 4 = 9$. The Lean proof mirrors this informal reasoning precisely by specializing the universal hypothesis to the specific value $x = 1$ and then computing the result.
