The key insight in this problem is that we have a linear function $f(x) = 5x + 4$, and we need to find the value of the function at $x = 1$. This is a straightforward computation: substitute $x = 1$ into the formula to get $f(1) = 5 \cdot 1 + 4 = 9$. The Lean proof follows this reasoning precisely by using the hypothesis `h₀` to rewrite $f(1)$ as $5 \cdot 1 + 4$, and then using `norm_num` to compute that this equals 9.

The problem is a basic example of function evaluation, where we apply the definition of a function to compute its value at a specific point. In Lean, we formalize this by:
1. Starting with the goal `f 1 = 9`
2. Using the hypothesis that `f x = 5 * x + 4` for all `x` to rewrite `f 1` as `5 * 1 + 4`
3. Using Lean's arithmetic computation capabilities to show that `5 * 1 + 4 = 9`

This demonstrates how Lean can formalize even simple mathematical computations in a rigorous way, ensuring that all steps are justified by the given hypotheses or by basic arithmetic facts.
