-- Consider the function $f(x)=5x+4$.  What is $f(1)$? Show that it is 9.-/
  -- We substitute $x=1$ into the function $f(x)$
  calc f 1 = 5 * 1 + 4 := h₀ 1
  -- Then we calculate $5 * 1 + 4 = 5 + 4 = 9$
          _ = 5 + 4 := by norm_num
          _ = 9     := by norm_num
```

This proof is straightforward. We have a function $f(x) = 5x + 4$, and we need to find $f(1)$. 

1. Substitute $x = 1$ into the function: $f(1) = 5 \cdot 1 + 4$.
2. Calculate $5 \cdot 1 + 4 = 5 + 4 = 9$.

In Lean, we represent this as follows:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

We're importing the necessary libraries and setting up the environment. The `maxHeartbeats 0` option allows Lean to use as many computational steps as needed.

Now, let's define our theorem:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_171 (f : ℝ → ℝ) (h₀ : ∀ x, f x = 5 * x + 4) : f 1 = 9 := by
```

We have a function $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(x) = 5x + 4$ for all $x$, and we need to prove that $f(1) = 9$.

Let's complete the proof:

```tactics
calc f 1 = 5 * 1 + 4 := h₀ 1
_ = 5 + 4 := by norm_num
_ = 9 := by norm_num
```

The proof is complete! We've shown that $f(1) = 5 \cdot 1 + 4 = 5 + 4 = 9$, which is our final answer.
