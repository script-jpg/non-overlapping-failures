In this Lean 4 proof, we have a function $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ with the property that $f(x) = 5x + 4$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$. We need to show that $f(1) = 9$.

First, we substitute $x = 1$ into the given formula for $f(x)$. This gives us $f(1) = 5 \times 1 + 4$.

Then we compute $5 \times 1 + 4 = 5 + 4 = 9$.

In Lean 4, we would formalize this as:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

Now we'll define the theorem:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_171 (f : ℝ → ℝ) (h₀ : ∀ x, f x = 5 * x + 4) : f 1 = 9 := by
```

We have the function $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ and the hypothesis $h₀ : \forall x, f x = 5 * x + 4$. We need to prove that $f 1 = 9$.

Let's apply the hypothesis to $x = 1$:

```tactics
rw [h₀]
norm_num
```

After rewriting with $h₀$, the goal becomes $5 * 1 + 4 = 9$. Then `norm_num` is able to compute that $5 * 1 + 4 = 9$ is true.

So the complete Lean proof shows that $f(1) = 5 \times 1 + 4 = 9$, as required.
