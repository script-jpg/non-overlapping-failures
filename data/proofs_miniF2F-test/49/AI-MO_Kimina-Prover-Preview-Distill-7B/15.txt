In this Lean 4 proof, we have a function $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ defined as $f(x) = 5x + 4$ for all $x$. We need to find the value of $f(1)$.

1. The proof begins by importing the necessary libraries and setting up the theorem statement:
   ```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

```

2. The theorem statement is defined as follows:
   ```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_171 (f : ℝ → ℝ) (h₀ : ∀ x, f x = 5 * x + 4) : f 1 = 9 := by
```

3. We need to prove that $f(1) = 9$. According to the definition of $f$, we have $f(1) = 5 \cdot 1 + 4 = 5 + 4 = 9$.

4. The proof strategy is straightforward: we simply apply the definition of $f$ and compute the value:
   ```tactics
rw [h₀]
norm_num
```

5. Let's explain these tactics:
   - `rw [h₀]` substitutes the definition of $f$ from the hypothesis `h₀ : ∀ x, f x = 5 * x + 4`. Specifically, it replaces $f(1)$ with $5 \cdot 1 + 4$.
   - `norm_num` is a powerful tactic that performs arithmetic calculations automatically. After the substitution, it computes $5 \cdot 1 + 4 = 9$ and verifies that the equality $f(1) = 9$ holds.

6. The proof is now complete. We have shown that $f(1) = 9$ by:
   1. Applying the definition of $f$ to rewrite $f(1)$ as $5 \cdot 1 + 4$
   2. Using Lean's arithmetic capabilities to compute $5 \cdot 1 + 4 = 9$

The proof is elegant in its simplicity, perfectly capturing the direct computation nature of evaluating a linear function at a specific point.
