In this Lean proof, we're proving that for a function $f(x) = 5x + 4$, we have $f(1) = 9$. 
1. We begin by importing the necessary libraries and setting up the theorem statement:
   ```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

```

2. Now we define the theorem with the given function and property:
   ```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_171 (f : ℝ → ℝ) (h₀ : ∀ x, f x = 5 * x + 4) : f 1 = 9 := by
```

3. To prove $f(1) = 9$, we start by using the definition of $f$ given by $h₀$:
   - Substitute $x = 1$ into $f(x) = 5x + 4$ to get $f(1) = 5 \cdot 1 + 4$.
   - Then simplify $5 \cdot 1 + 4 = 5 + 4 = 9$.

   In Lean, we can do this directly using the `simp` tactic with the hypothesis $h₀$:
   ```tactics
simp [h₀]
ring
```

The `simp [h₀]` tactic substitutes the definition of $f$ from $h₀$ into the goal $f 1 = 9$, transforming it to $5 * 1 + 4 = 9$. Then the `ring` tactic proves this arithmetic equality by computing that $5 * 1 + 4 = 5 + 4 = 9$.

Therefore, the complete proof demonstrates that $f(1) = 9$ as required.
