The theorem states that for a function $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(x) = 5x + 4$, we have $f(1) = 9$. 

To prove this, we simply need to substitute $x = 1$ into the function definition and compute the result. 

1. Start with the function definition: $f(x) = 5x + 4$.
2. Substitute $x = 1$: $f(1) = 5 \cdot 1 + 4$.
3. Compute the result: $5 \cdot 1 + 4 = 5 + 4 = 9$.

In Lean 4, we represent this as follows:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

We import the necessary libraries and open namespaces to work with real numbers and basic arithmetic.

Next, we define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_171 (f : ℝ → ℝ) (h₀ : ∀ x, f x = 5 * x + 4) : f 1 = 9 := by
```

Now we have a function $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ and the hypothesis that $f(x) = 5x + 4$ for all $x$. We need to prove that $f(1) = 9$.

To prove this, we'll:
1. Use the hypothesis $h₀$ to rewrite $f(1)$ as $5 \cdot 1 + 4$
2. Compute $5 \cdot 1 + 4 = 9$ using Lean's computational tactics

Let's complete the proof:

```tactics
rw [h₀]
norm_num
```

The `rw` tactic rewrites $f(1)$ as $5 \cdot 1 + 4$ using our hypothesis $h₀$. Then `norm_num` computes $5 \cdot 1 + 4 = 9$.

Therefore, we have proved that $f(1) = 9$.

This completes our proof. We have shown that for the function $f(x) = 5x + 4$, the value of $f(1)$ is indeed 9.
