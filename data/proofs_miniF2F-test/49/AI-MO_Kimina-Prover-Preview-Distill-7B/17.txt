  -- The proof is now complete. We have shown that $f(1) = 9$ for the function $f(x) = 5x + 4$.
```

This proof is straightforward because we have a direct definition of the function $f$. We simply substitute $x = 1$ into the definition $f(x) = 5x + 4$ to get $f(1) = 5 \cdot 1 + 4 = 9$. The Lean proof does exactly this: it rewrites $f(1)$ using the hypothesis $h₀$ that tells us $f(x) = 5x + 4$ for all $x$, and then it computes $5 \cdot 1 + 4 = 9$ using Lean's `norm_num` tactic.

The key insight is that once we have a function definition, we can compute the value of the function at any specific point by substitution. In this case, substituting $x = 1$ into $5x + 4$ gives us $5 \cdot 1 + 4 = 9$. The Lean proof mirrors this informal calculation precisely.

Therefore, we have formally proven that $f(1) = 9$.
