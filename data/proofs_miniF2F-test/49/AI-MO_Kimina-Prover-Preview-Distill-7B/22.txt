This theorem states that for a function $f$ from reals to reals, if $f$ satisfies $f(x) = 5x + 4$ for all $x$, then $f(1) = 9$. 

The proof is straightforward:
1. We substitute $x = 1$ into the given functional equation: $f(1) = 5 \cdot 1 + 4$
2. We compute $5 \cdot 1 + 4 = 5 + 4 = 9$
3. Therefore, $f(1) = 9$

The Lean 4 proof reflects this reasoning exactly. It first rewrites $f(1)$ using the hypothesis $h₀$ that $f(x) = 5x + 4$ for all $x$. This transforms $f(1)$ into $5 \cdot 1 + 4$. Then it uses the `norm_num` tactic to compute that $5 \cdot 1 + 4 = 9$.

So the complete formal proof is:
```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

theorem mathd_algebra_171 (f : ℝ → ℝ) (h₀ : ∀ x, f x = 5 * x + 4) : f 1 = 9 := by
  rw [h₀]
  norm_num
```

This proof is elegant and concise because it directly applies the given hypothesis to the specific case where $x = 1$, and then performs numerical computation to show that $5 \cdot 1 + 4 = 9$. 

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{9}$.

# Formalizing the Function in Lean 4

We need to formalize the function $f(x) = 5x + 4$ in Lean 4 and prove that $f(1) = 9$.

First, let's think about how to represent this function in Lean. We have a function $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(x) = 5x + 4$. In Lean, we'll need to express this definition and then evaluate it at $x = 1$.

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

We've imported the necessary libraries and opened namespaces to access mathematical definitions and theorems. The `maxHeartbeats 0` setting allows Lean to perform more computations which might be needed for evaluating the function.

Now let's define our theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_171 (f : ℝ → ℝ) (h₀ : ∀ x, f x = 5 * x + 4) : f 1 = 9 := by
```

Our theorem states that for a function $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$, if $f(x) = 5x + 4$ for all $x$, then $f(1) = 9$. 

To prove this, we need to:
1. Use the hypothesis to get $f(1) = 5 \cdot 1 + 4$
2. Compute $5 \cdot 1 + 4 = 9$

Let's complete the proof:

```tactics
rw [h₀]
norm_num
```

The first tactic `rw [h₀]` rewrites $f(1)$ using our hypothesis $h₀$, replacing it with $5 \cdot 1 + 4$. Then `norm_num` computes this arithmetic expression to get 9.

Therefore, $f(1) = 9$ is proven.

The complete formal proof demonstrates how to work with function definitions in Lean and evaluate them at specific points by substitution and computation.

# Formalizing the Function in Lean 4

To formalize the function $f(x) = 5x + 4$ in Lean 4 and prove that $f(1) = 9$, we'll need to define the function and then verify the specific value. 

First, let's think about how to structure the proof:

1. We need to define the function $f$ such that for any input $x$, $f(x) = 5x + 4$.
2. Then we need to prove that when we evaluate $f(1)$, we get 9.

In Lean 4, we'll start by importing the necessary library and setting up the theorem statement:

```tactics
import Mathlib
```

Now we'll define the theorem. We need to state that for a function $f$ where $f(x) = 5x + 4$ for all $x$, it follows that $f(1) = 9$:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_171 (f : ℝ → ℝ) (h₀ : ∀ x, f x = 5 * x + 4) : f 1 = 9 := by 
```

We have a function $f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ and the hypothesis that for all $x$, $f(x) = 5x + 4$. We need to prove that $f(1) = 9$.

To prove this, we simply apply the hypothesis to $x = 1$:

```tactics
rw [h₀ 1]
norm_num
```

In this proof:
1. `rw [h₀ 1]` rewrites $f(1)$ as $5 \cdot 1 + 4$ using our hypothesis.
2. `norm_num` then computes $5 \cdot 1 + 4 = 9$.

Therefore, the complete proof shows that $f(1) = 5 \cdot 1 + 4 = 9$, which is exactly what we needed to prove.
