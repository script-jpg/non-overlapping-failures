The proof is straightforward. We have a function $f(x) = 5x + 4$, and we need to find $f(1)$. By substituting $x = 1$ into the function, we get $f(1) = 5 \cdot 1 + 4 = 5 + 4 = 9$. The Lean proof captures this reasoning precisely:

1. We start with the hypothesis that $f(x) = 5x + 4$ for all $x$.
2. We specialize this to $x = 1$, giving us $f(1) = 5 \cdot 1 + 4$.
3. We then compute $5 \cdot 1 + 4 = 9$ using Lean's computation capabilities.

Therefore, $f(1) = 9$.
