In this proof, we're given a function $f(x) = 5x + 4$ and need to find $f(1)$. 

1. We specialize the hypothesis `h₀` to the input `1`, which gives us `f 1 = 5 * 1 + 4`.
2. We rewrite `f 1` using this equation.
3. The `norm_num` tactic computes `5 * 1 + 4 = 9`, completing the proof.

This is a straightforward application of function evaluation in Lean, demonstrating how Lean can verify simple arithmetic facts by computation.
