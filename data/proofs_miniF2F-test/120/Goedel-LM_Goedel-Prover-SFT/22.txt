  To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the function \( f \) composed multiple times with the given properties. The function \( f \) is defined as follows:
  \[ f(n) = \begin{cases} 
  n^2 & \text{if } n \text{ is odd} \\
  n^2 - 4n - 1 & \text{if } n \text{ is even}
  \end{cases} \]
  We start by evaluating \( f(4) \). Since 4 is even, we use the second case of the function definition:
  \[ f(4) = 4^2 - 4 \cdot 4 - 1 \]
  Calculating the right-hand side:
  \[ 4^2 = 16 \]
  \[ 4 \cdot 4 = 16 \]
  \[ 16 - 16 - 1 = -1 \]
  Thus, \( f(4) = -1 \).

  -- Evaluate f(4) using the definition of f for even numbers.
  have h₄ := h₁ 4 (by decide)
  -- Simplify the expression to get f(4) = -1.
  simp at h₄
  -- Use the simplified expression to conclude the proof.
  simp [h₄]
