  To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the function \( f \) composed multiple times, starting from the initial value 4. The function \( f \) is defined piecewise based on whether \( n \) is odd or even. We will apply the function step-by-step and simplify the expressions to reach the final result.
  1. Start with \( n = 4 \).
  2. Since 4 is even, apply the second piece of the function: \( f(4) = 4^2 - 4 \cdot 4 - 1 \).
  3. Calculate \( 4^2 = 16 \).
  4. Calculate \( 4 \cdot 4 = 16 \).
  5. Substitute these values into the expression: \( 16 - 16 - 1 = -1 \).
  Thus, \( f(4) = -1 \).
