  To solve for \( f(f(f(f(f(4)))) \) where \( f \) is defined as:
  \[ f(n) = \begin{cases} 
  n^2 & \text{if } n \text{ is odd}, \\
  n^2 - 4n - 1 & \text{if } n \text{ is even},
  \end{cases} \]
  we need to evaluate \( f \) step by step.
  1. **Evaluate \( f(4) \)**:
     - Since 4 is even, we use \( f(n) = n^2 - 4n - 1 \).
     - Substituting \( n = 4 \):
       \[ f(4) = 4^2 - 4 \cdot 4 - 1 = 16 - 16 - 1 = -1 \]
  2. **Evaluate \( f(f(4)) \)**:
     - We already found \( f(4) = -1 \).
     - Since \(-1\) is odd, we use \( f(n) = n^2 \).
     - Substituting \( n = -1 \):
       \[ f(-1) = (-1)^2 = 1 \]
  3. **Evaluate \( f(f(f(4))) \)**:
     - We already found \( f(f(4)) = 1 \).
     - Since \(1\) is odd, we use \( f(n) = n^2 \).
     - Substituting \( n = 1 \):
       \[ f(1) = 1^2 = 1 \]
  4. **Evaluate \( f(f(f(f(4)))) \)**:
     - We already found \( f(f(f(4))) = 1 \).
     - Since \(1\) is odd, we use \( f(n) = n^2 \).
     - Substituting \( n = 1 \):
       \[ f(1) = 1^2 = 1 \]
  5. **Evaluate \( f(f(f(f(f(4))))) \)**:
     - We already found \( f(f(f(f(4)))) = 1 \).
     - Since \(1\) is odd, we use \( f(n) = n^2 \).
     - Substituting \( n = 1 \):
       \[ f(1) = 1^2 = 1 \]
  Thus, \( f(f(f(f(f(4)))))) = 1 \).
