  To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the function \( f \) composed multiple times with the given rules. The function \( f \) is defined as follows:
  \[ f(n) = \begin{cases} 
  n^2 & \text{if } n \text{ is odd}, \\
  n^2 - 4n - 1 & \text{if } n \text{ is even}.
  \end{cases} \]
  We start by evaluating \( f(4) \). Since 4 is even, we use the second case of the function definition:
  \[ f(4) = 4^2 - 4 \cdot 4 - 1 = 16 - 16 - 1 = -1. \]
  Thus, \( f(4) = -1 \).

  -- Evaluate f(4) using the definition of f for even numbers.
  have h₂ := h₁ 4 (by decide)
  -- Simplify the expression for f(4).
  simp at h₂
  -- Since f(4) = -1, we have the desired result.
  simp [h₂]
