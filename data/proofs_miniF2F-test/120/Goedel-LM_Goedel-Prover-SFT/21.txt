  To find \( f(f(f(f(f(4))))) \) where \( f(n) \) is defined as:
  \[ f(n) = \begin{cases} 
  n^2 & \text{if } n \text{ is odd}, \\
  n^2 - 4n - 1 & \text{if } n \text{ is even},
  \end{cases} \]
  we need to evaluate \( f \) step by step for \( n = 4 \).
  1. \( f(4) \):
     - Since 4 is even, we use the second case:
       \[ f(4) = 4^2 - 4 \cdot 4 - 1 = 16 - 16 - 1 = -1. \]
  Thus, \( f(f(f(f(f(4))))) = -1 \).
