  To find \( f(f(f(f(f(4))))) \) where \( f \) is defined as:
  \[ f(n) = \begin{cases} 
  n^2 & \text{if } n \text{ is odd} \\
  n^2 - 4n - 1 & \text{if } n \text{ is even} 
  \end{cases} \]
  we need to evaluate \( f \) step by step.
  1. \( f(4) \):
     - Since 4 is even, \( f(4) = 4^2 - 4 \cdot 4 - 1 \).
     - Calculate: \( 4^2 - 4 \cdot 4 - 1 = 16 - 16 - 1 = -1 \).
  2. \( f(f(4)) = f(-1) \):
     - Since -1 is odd, \( f(-1) = (-1)^2 = 1 \).
  3. \( f(f(f(4))) = f(1) \):
     - Since 1 is odd, \( f(1) = 1^2 = 1 \).
  4. \( f(f(f(f(4)))) = f(1) \):
     - Since 1 is odd, \( f(1) = 1^2 = 1 \).
  5. \( f(f(f(f(f(4))))) = f(1) \):
     - Since 1 is odd, \( f(1) = 1^2 = 1 \).
  Thus, \( f(f(f(f(f(4))))) = 1 \).
