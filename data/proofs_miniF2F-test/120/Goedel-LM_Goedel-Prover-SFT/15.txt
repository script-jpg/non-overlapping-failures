  To find \( f(f(f(f(f(4))))) \) where \( f(n) \) is defined as:
  \[ f(n) = \begin{cases} 
  n^2 & \text{if } n \text{ is odd}, \\
  n^2 - 4n - 1 & \text{if } n \text{ is even}.
  \end{cases} \]
  we need to evaluate \( f(4) \).
  1. Since \( 4 \) is even, \( f(4) = 4^2 - 4 \cdot 4 - 1 \).
  2. Calculate \( 4^2 - 4 \cdot 4 - 1 \):
     \[ 4^2 = 16 \]
     \[ 4 \cdot 4 = 16 \]
     \[ 16 - 16 - 1 = -1 \]
  Thus, \( f(4) = -1 \).

  -- Since 4 is even, we use the second definition of f.
  have : Even 4 := by decide
  -- Evaluate f(4) using the definition for even numbers.
  have h₂ := h₁ 4 this
  -- Simplify the expression for f(4).
