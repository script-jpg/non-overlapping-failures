  To solve the problem, we need to evaluate \( f(f(f(f(f(4))))) \) given the function \( f \) defined as follows:
  \[ f(n) = \begin{cases} 
  n^2 & \text{if } n \text{ is odd}, \\
  n^2 - 4n - 1 & \text{if } n \text{ is even}.
  \end{cases} \]
  We start by evaluating \( f(4) \):
  1. Since 4 is even, by the definition of \( f \), we have:
  \[ f(4) = 4^2 - 4 \cdot 4 - 1. \]
  2. Calculate the expression:
  \[ 4^2 = 16, \]
  \[ 4 \cdot 4 = 16, \]
  \[ 16 - 16 - 1 = -1. \]
  Thus, \( f(4) = -1 \).

  -- Since 4 is even, we use the second case of the function definition.
  have h₁_4 : Even 4 := by decide
  -- Evaluate f(4) using the definition for even numbers.
  simp [h₁, h₁_4]
  -- Simplify the expression to get the final result.
