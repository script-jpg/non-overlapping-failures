  To solve the problem, we need to evaluate \( f(f(f(f(f(4))))) \) given the function \( f \) defined as:
  \[ f(n) = \begin{cases} 
  n^2 & \text{if } n \text{ is odd}, \\
  n^2 - 4n - 1 & \text{if } n \text{ is even}.
  \end{cases} \]
  We start by evaluating \( f(4) \):
  - Since 4 is even, we use the second case of the function:
    \[ f(4) = 4^2 - 4 \cdot 4 - 1 = 16 - 16 - 1 = -1. \]
  Thus, \( f(4) = -1 \).

  -- Evaluate f(4) using the definition of f for even numbers
  have h : f 4 = 4 ^ 2 - 4 * 4 - 1 := by simp [h₁, Int.even_iff]
  -- Simplify the expression to get the final result
