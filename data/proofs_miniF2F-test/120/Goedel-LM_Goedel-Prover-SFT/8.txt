  To solve the problem, we need to evaluate \( f(f(f(f(f(4))))) \) given the function \( f \) defined as follows:
  \[ f(n) = \begin{cases} 
  n^2 & \text{if } n \text{ is odd}, \\
  n^2 - 4n - 1 & \text{if } n \text{ is even}.
  \end{cases} \]
  First, we need to determine the value of \( f(4) \). Since 4 is even, we use the second case of the function definition:
  \[ f(4) = 4^2 - 4 \cdot 4 - 1 \]
  Calculating this expression:
  \[ 4^2 = 16 \]
  \[ 4 \cdot 4 = 16 \]
  \[ 16 - 16 - 1 = -1 \]
  Thus, \( f(4) = -1 \).
