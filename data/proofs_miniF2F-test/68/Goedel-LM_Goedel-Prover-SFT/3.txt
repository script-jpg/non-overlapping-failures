  To solve the equation \((x + 3)^2 = 121\), we start by expanding and simplifying the equation. This gives us:
  \[ x^2 + 6x + 9 = 121 \]
  Next, we isolate the quadratic term by subtracting 9 from both sides:
  \[ x^2 + 6x = 112 \]
  We then complete the square on the left-hand side:
  \[ (x + 3)^2 = 112 + 9 \]
  \[ (x + 3)^2 = 121 \]
  This confirms that the solutions to the equation are \(x + 3 = \pm 11\). Therefore, the solutions are:
  \[ x = 11 - 3 = 8 \]
  \[ x = -11 - 3 = -14 \]
  The sum of these solutions is:
  \[ 8 + (-14) = -6 \]
  Thus, the sum of the two values of \(x\) that satisfy \((x + 3)^2 = 121\) is \(-6\).

  -- We need to find the values of x that satisfy the equation (x + 3)^2 = 121.
  -- Expanding and simplifying the equation gives x^2 + 6x + 9 = 121.
  -- Subtracting 9 from both sides gives x^2 + 6x = 112.
  -- Completing the square on the left-hand side gives (x + 3)^2 = 121.
  -- This confirms that x + 3 = ±11.
  -- Therefore, the solutions are x = 8 and x = -14.
  -- The sum of these solutions is 8 + (-14) = -6.
