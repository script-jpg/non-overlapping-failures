  To solve the equation \((x+3)^2 = 121\), we first expand and simplify the equation:
  \[
  (x+3)^2 = x^2 + 6x + 9 = 121
  \]
  Subtracting 121 from both sides, we get:
  \[
  x^2 + 6x + 9 - 121 = 0 \implies x^2 + 6x - 112 = 0
  \]
  This is a quadratic equation, which can be factored as:
  \[
  (x - 8)(x + 14) = 0
  \]
  Thus, the solutions are \(x = 8\) and \(x = -14\). The sum of these solutions is:
  \[
  8 + (-14) = -6
  \]
