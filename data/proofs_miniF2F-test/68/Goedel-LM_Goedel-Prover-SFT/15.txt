  To solve the problem, we need to find the sum of the two values of \( x \) for which \((x + 3)^2 = 121\). We start by identifying the values of \( x \) that satisfy this equation. 
  1. Expanding \((x + 3)^2 = 121\), we get \( x^2 + 6x + 9 = 121 \).
  2. Subtracting 121 from both sides, we obtain \( x^2 + 6x + 9 - 121 = 0 \), which simplifies to \( x^2 + 6x - 112 = 0 \).
  3. We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 6 \), and \( c = -112 \).
  4. Calculating the discriminant, we find \( \Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 6^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-112) = 36 + 448 = 484 \).
  5. Since the discriminant is positive, we have two real solutions: \( x = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{484}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-6 \pm 22}{2} \).
  6. This gives us the solutions \( x = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) and \( x = \frac{-28}{2} = -14 \).
  7. The sum of these solutions is \( 8 + (-14) = -6 \).
  Thus, the sum of the two values of \( x \) for which \((x + 3)^2 = 121\) is \(-6\).
