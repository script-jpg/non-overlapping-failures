  To solve the problem, we need to find the sum of the two values of \( x \) for which \((x + 3)^2 = 121\). We start by setting up the equation \((x + 3)^2 = 121\), which simplifies to \( x^2 + 6x + 9 = 121 \). Solving for \( x \), we get \( x^2 + 6x - 112 = 0 \). This is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 6 \), and \( c = -112 \). Substituting these values in, we find the roots:
  \[ x = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{6^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-112)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{36 + 448}}{2} = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{484}}{2} = \frac{-6 \pm 22}{2} \]
  This gives us the roots \( x = 8 \) and \( x = -14 \). The sum of these roots is \( 8 + (-14) = -6 \).
