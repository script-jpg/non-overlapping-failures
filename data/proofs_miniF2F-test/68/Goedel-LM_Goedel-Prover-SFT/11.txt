  To solve the problem, we need to find the sum of the two values of \( x \) for which \((x + 3)^2 = 121\). We start by expanding and simplifying the equation:
  \[
  (x + 3)^2 = 121
  \]
  Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
  \[
  x^2 + 6x + 9 = 121
  \]
  Next, we isolate the quadratic term by subtracting 9 from both sides:
  \[
  x^2 + 6x = 112
  \]
  We then solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 6 \), and \( c = -112 \):
  \[
  x = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{6^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-112)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{36 + 448}}{2} = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{484}}{2} = \frac{-6 \pm 22}{2}
  \]
  This gives us two solutions:
  \[
  x = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{-28}{2} = -14
  \]
  The sum of these two values is:
  \[
  8 + (-14) = -6
  \]
  Thus, the sum of the two values of \( x \) for which \((x + 3)^2 = 121\) is indeed \(-6\).
