  To solve the equation \((x+3)^2 = 121\), we first rewrite it as \(x^2 + 6x + 9 = 121\). Subtracting 121 from both sides, we get \(x^2 + 6x - 112 = 0\). This is a quadratic equation, which we can factor as \((x - 8)(x + 14) = 0\). By the zero product property, the solutions are \(x = 8\) and \(x = -14\). The sum of these solutions is \(8 + (-14) = -6\).

  -- We need to find the sum of all x such that (x + 3)^2 = 121.
  -- First, expand and simplify the equation: x^2 + 6x + 9 = 121.
  -- Subtract 121 from both sides: x^2 + 6x - 112 = 0.
  -- Factor the quadratic equation: (x - 8)(x + 14) = 0.
  -- By the zero product property, the solutions are x = 8 and x = -14.
