  To solve the problem, we need to find the sum of the two values of \( x \) for which \( (x + 3)^2 = 121 \). We start by considering the equation \( (x + 3)^2 = 121 \). This implies that \( x + 3 \) must be either \( 11 \) or \( -11 \) because the square of a number is 121 if and only if the number is 11 or -11. Therefore, we have:
  \[
  x + 3 = 11 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 3 = -11
  \]
  Solving these equations separately, we get:
  \[
  x = 11 - 3 = 8 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -11 - 3 = -14
  \]
  Thus, the two values of \( x \) are \( 8 \) and \( -14 \). To find the sum of these values, we add them together:
  \[
  8 + (-14) = -6
  \]
  Therefore, the sum of the two values of \( x \) is \( -6 \).
