  To solve the problem, we need to find the sum of the two values of \( x \) for which \( (x + 3)^2 = 121 \). We start by analyzing the equation \( (x + 3)^2 = 121 \). This equation implies that \( x + 3 \) must be either \( \sqrt{121} \) or \( -\sqrt{121} \) because the square of a number is 121 if and only if the number is \( \pm \sqrt{121} \).
  First, we calculate \( \sqrt{121} \):
  \[
  \sqrt{121} = 11
  \]
  Thus, the equation \( (x + 3)^2 = 121 \) can be rewritten as:
  \[
  x + 3 = \pm 11
  \]
  This gives us two solutions:
  \[
  x + 3 = 11 \quad \text{and} \quad x + 3 = -11
  \]
  Solving these equations, we get:
  \[
  x = 11 - 3 = 8 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -11 - 3 = -14
  \]
  The sum of these two values is:
  \[
  8 + (-14) = -6
  \]
  Thus, the sum of the two values of \( x \) for which \( (x + 3)^2 = 121 \) is \( -6 \).
