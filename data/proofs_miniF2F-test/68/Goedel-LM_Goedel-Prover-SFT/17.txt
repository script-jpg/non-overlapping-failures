  To solve the equation \((x + 3)^2 = 121\), we start by expanding and simplifying the equation. This gives us:
  \[
  (x + 3)^2 = x^2 + 6x + 9 = 121
  \]
  Subtracting 121 from both sides, we obtain:
  \[
  x^2 + 6x + 9 - 121 = 0 \implies x^2 + 6x - 112 = 0
  \]
  Next, we solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 6\), and \(c = -112\). Substituting these values in, we get:
  \[
  x = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{6^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-112)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{36 + 448}}{2} = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{484}}{2} = \frac{-6 \pm 22}{2}
  \]
  This gives us two solutions:
  \[
  x = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{-28}{2} = -14
  \]
  Thus, the sum of the two values of \(x\) is:
  \[
  8 + (-14) = -6
  \]
