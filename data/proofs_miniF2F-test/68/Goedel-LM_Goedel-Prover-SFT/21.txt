  To find the sum of the two values of \( x \) for which \( (x + 3)^2 = 121 \), we start by solving the equation \( (x + 3)^2 = 121 \). Taking the square root of both sides, we get \( x + 3 = 11 \) or \( x + 3 = -11 \). Solving these equations separately, we find \( x = 8 \) or \( x = -14 \). The sum of these two values, \( 8 \) and \( -14 \), is \( 8 + (-14) = -6 \).
