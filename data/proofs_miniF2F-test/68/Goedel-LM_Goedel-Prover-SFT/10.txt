  To solve the problem, we need to find the sum of the two values of \( x \) for which \( (x + 3)^2 = 121 \). We start by solving the equation \( (x + 3)^2 = 121 \). Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
  \[ x + 3 = \pm 11 \]
  This gives us two solutions:
  \[ x = 11 - 3 = 8 \]
  \[ x = -11 - 3 = -14 \]
  Thus, the sum of these solutions is:
  \[ 8 + (-14) = -6 \]
