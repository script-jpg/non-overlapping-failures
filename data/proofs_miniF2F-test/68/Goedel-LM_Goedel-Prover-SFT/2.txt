  To solve the problem, we start by identifying the values of \( x \) for which \((x + 3)^2 = 121\). We then sum these values and show that the sum is \(-6\).
  1. **Identify the values of \( x \)**:
     - We solve the equation \((x + 3)^2 = 121\).
     - Taking the square root of both sides, we get \( x + 3 = \pm 11 \).
     - This gives us two solutions: \( x = 11 - 3 = 8 \) and \( x = -11 - 3 = -14 \).
  2. **Sum the values**:
     - The sum of the values \( 8 \) and \( -14 \) is \( 8 + (-14) = -6 \).
  Thus, the sum of the two values of \( x \) that satisfy the equation \((x + 3)^2 = 121\) is indeed \(-6\).
