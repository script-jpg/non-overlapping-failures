  To solve the problem of finding the sum of the two values of \( x \) for which \((x + 3)^2 = 121\), we start by analyzing the equation \((x + 3)^2 = 121\). This implies that \( x + 3 \) must be either \( 11 \) or \( -11 \) because the square of a number is \( 121 \) if and only if the number is \( 11 \) or \( -11 \). Therefore, we have:
  \[ x + 3 = 11 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 3 = -11 \]
  Solving these equations separately:
  1. \( x + 3 = 11 \)
     \[ x = 11 - 3 \]
     \[ x = 8 \]
  2. \( x + 3 = -11 \)
     \[ x = -11 - 3 \]
     \[ x = -14 \]
  Thus, the two values of \( x \) that satisfy the equation are \( 8 \) and \( -14 \). The sum of these values is:
  \[ 8 + (-14) = -6 \]
