  To solve the problem of finding the sum of the two values of \( x \) for which \( (x + 3)^2 = 121 \), we start by analyzing the given equation. We know that \( (x + 3)^2 = 121 \). Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
  \[ x + 3 = \pm 11 \]
  This gives us two equations:
  \[ x + 3 = 11 \]
  \[ x + 3 = -11 \]
  Solving these equations separately:
  1. For \( x + 3 = 11 \):
  \[ x = 11 - 3 \]
  \[ x = 8 \]
  2. For \( x + 3 = -11 \):
  \[ x = -11 - 3 \]
  \[ x = -14 \]
  Thus, the two values of \( x \) that satisfy the equation \( (x + 3)^2 = 121 \) are \( x = 8 \) and \( x = -14 \). The sum of these values is:
  \[ 8 + (-14) = -6 \]
