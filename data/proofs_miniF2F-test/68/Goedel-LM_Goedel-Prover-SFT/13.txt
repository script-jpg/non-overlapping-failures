  To solve the equation \((x + 3)^2 = 121\), we start by expanding the left-hand side and then simplifying to find the values of \(x\). The expanded form of \((x + 3)^2\) is \(x^2 + 6x + 9\). Setting this equal to 121, we get the quadratic equation \(x^2 + 6x + 9 = 121\). Rearranging this equation, we obtain \(x^2 + 6x - 112 = 0\). This can be factored as \((x + 3 + 7)(x + 3 - 7) = 0\), which simplifies to \((x + 10)(x - 4) = 0\). The solutions to this equation are \(x = -10\) and \(x = 4\). The sum of these two solutions is \(-10 + 4 = -6\).
