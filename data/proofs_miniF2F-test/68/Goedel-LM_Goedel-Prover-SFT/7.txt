  To solve the equation \((x + 3)^2 = 121\), we first expand and simplify the equation to find the roots. The equation can be rewritten as \(x^2 + 6x + 9 = 121\). Subtracting 121 from both sides, we get \(x^2 + 6x + 9 - 121 = 0\), which simplifies to \(x^2 + 6x - 112 = 0\). This is a quadratic equation, which can be factored as \((x + 16)(x - 7) = 0\). Therefore, the solutions are \(x = -16\) and \(x = 7\). The sum of these solutions is \(-16 + 7 = -9\).
