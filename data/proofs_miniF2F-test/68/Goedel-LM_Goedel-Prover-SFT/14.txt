  To solve the problem of finding the sum of the two values of \( x \) for which \( (x + 3)^2 = 121 \), we start by analyzing the given equation. We know that \( (x + 3)^2 = 121 \) can be expanded and rearranged to form a quadratic equation. Solving this quadratic equation, we find that the roots are \( x = -3 + 11 \) and \( x = -3 - 11 \). Adding these roots together, we get:
  \[
  (-3 + 11) + (-3 - 11) = -3 + 11 - 3 - 11 = -6
  \]
  Thus, the sum of the two values of \( x \) is \( -6 \).
