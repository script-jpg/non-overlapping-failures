  To solve the equation \((x + 3)^2 = 121\), we first take the square root of both sides, which gives us two solutions: \(x + 3 = 11\) and \(x + 3 = -11\). Solving these equations separately, we find that \(x = 8\) and \(x = -14\). Therefore, the sum of the two values of \(x\) that satisfy the equation is \(8 + (-14) = -6\).
