  To solve the problem, we start by finding the values of \( x \) for which \((x + 3)^2 = 121\). We know that \( 121 = 11^2 \), so we have:
  \[
  (x + 3)^2 = 11^2
  \]
  Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
  \[
  x + 3 = \pm 11
  \]
  This gives us two equations:
  \[
  x + 3 = 11 \quad \text{and} \quad x + 3 = -11
  \]
  Solving these equations separately:
  1. \( x + 3 = 11 \)
  \[
  x = 11 - 3
  \]
  \[
  x = 8
  \]
  2. \( x + 3 = -11 \)
  \[
  x = -11 - 3
  \]
  \[
  x = -14
  \]
  Thus, the values of \( x \) are \( 8 \) and \( -14 \). The sum of these values is:
  \[
  8 + (-14) = -6
  \]
