  To solve for \( x \) in the equation \((x + 3)^2 = 121\), we first take the square root of both sides to find the possible values of \(x + 3\). This gives us:
  
  \[ x + 3 = \pm 11 \]
  
  Next, we subtract 3 from both sides to isolate \( x \):
  
  \[ x = -3 \pm 11 \]
  
  This yields two possible solutions:
  
  \[ x = -3 + 11 = 8 \]
  \[ x = -3 - 11 = -14 \]
  
  To find the sum of these two solutions, we add them together:
  
  \[ 8 + (-14) = 8 - 14 = -6 \]
  
  Thus, the sum of the two values of \( x \) that satisfy the equation \((x + 3)^2 = 121\) is \(-6\).
