  To solve the equation \((x + 3)^2 = 121\), we first take the square root of both sides to find the possible values of \(x + 3\). This gives us:

  \[ x + 3 = 11 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 3 = -11 \]

  Next, we solve each equation separately:

  1. For \(x + 3 = 11\):
     \[ x = 11 - 3 \]
     \[ x = 8 \]

  2. For \(x + 3 = -11\):
     \[ x = -11 - 3 \]
     \[ x = -14 \]

  Thus, the two solutions are \(x = 8\) and \(x = -14\). The sum of these two solutions is:
  \[ 8 + (-14) = 8 - 14 = -6 \]

  Therefore, the sum of the two values of \(x\) that satisfy the equation \((x + 3)^2 = 121\) is \(-6\).
