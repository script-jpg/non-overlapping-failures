  To solve the equation \((x + 3)^2 = 121\), we first take the square root of both sides to find the possible values of \(x + 3\). This gives us:
  
  \[ x + 3 = \pm 11 \]
  
  Next, we solve for \(x\) by subtracting 3 from both sides of each equation:
  
  \[ x + 3 = 11 \implies x = 8 \]
  
  \[ x + 3 = -11 \implies x = -14 \]
  
  We now find the sum of these two solutions:
  
  \[ 8 + (-14) = -6 \]
  
  Thus, the sum of the two values of \(x\) that satisfy the equation \((x + 3)^2 = 121\) is \(-6\).
