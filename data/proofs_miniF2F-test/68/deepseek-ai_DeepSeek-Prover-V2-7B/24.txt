  To solve the equation \((x + 3)^2 = 121\) and find the sum of the two values of \(x\) that satisfy it, we can follow these steps:
  
  1. Take the square root of both sides to find the possible values of \(x + 3\).
  2. Solve for \(x\) in each case.
  3. Calculate the sum of the solutions.
  
  **Step 1: Take the square root of both sides**
  
  \[
  (x + 3)^2 = 121
  \]
  
  Taking the square root of both sides:
  
  \[
  x + 3 = \pm \sqrt{121}
  \]
  
  Since \(\sqrt{121} = 11\), we have:
  
  \[
  x + 3 = 11 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 3 = -11
  \]
  
  **Step 2: Solve for \(x\) in each case**
  
  **Case 1:**
  
  \[
  x + 3 = 11
  \]
  
  Subtract 3 from both sides:
  
  \[
  x = 11 - 3 = 8
  \]
  
  **Case 2:**
  
  \[
  x + 3 = -11
  \]
  
  Subtract 3 from both sides:
  
  \[
  x = -11 - 3 = -14
  \]
  
  **Step 3: Calculate the sum of the solutions**
  
  The two solutions are \(x = 8\) and \(x = -14\). The sum of these solutions is:
  
  \[
  8 + (-14) = 8 - 14 = -6
  \]
  
  Thus, the sum of the two values of \(x\) that satisfy the equation \((x + 3)^2 = 121\) is \(-6\).
