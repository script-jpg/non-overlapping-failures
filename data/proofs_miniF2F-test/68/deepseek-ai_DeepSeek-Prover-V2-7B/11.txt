  To solve the equation \((x + 3)^2 = 121\) for \(x\), we first take the square root of both sides. This gives us two cases:
  
  1. \(x + 3 = 11\)
  2. \(x + 3 = -11\)
  
  Next, we solve each case separately.
  
  **Case 1: \(x + 3 = 11\)**
  
  Subtract 3 from both sides:
  \[ x = 11 - 3 = 8 \]
  
  **Case 2: \(x + 3 = -11\)**
  
  Subtract 3 from both sides:
  \[ x = -11 - 3 = -14 \]
  
  Thus, the solutions to the equation \((x + 3)^2 = 121\) are \(x = 8\) and \(x = -14\).
  
  To find the sum of these two solutions, we add them together:
  \[ 8 + (-14) = 8 - 14 = -6 \]
  
  Therefore, the sum of the two values of \(x\) that satisfy the equation \((x + 3)^2 = 121\) is \(-6\).
