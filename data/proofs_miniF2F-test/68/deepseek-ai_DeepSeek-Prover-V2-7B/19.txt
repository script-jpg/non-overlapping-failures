  To solve the equation \((x + 3)^2 = 121\) for \(x\), we first take the square root of both sides to find the possible values of \(x + 3\). This gives us:
  
  \[ x + 3 = \sqrt{121} \quad \text{or} \quad x + 3 = -\sqrt{121} \]
  
  Since \(\sqrt{121} = 11\), we have:
  
  \[ x + 3 = 11 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 3 = -11 \]
  
  Solving these equations for \(x\), we get:
  
  \[ x = 11 - 3 = 8 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -11 - 3 = -14 \]
  
  Next, we find the sum of these two solutions:
  
  \[ 8 + (-14) = 8 - 14 = -6 \]
  
  Thus, the sum of the two values of \(x\) that satisfy the equation \((x + 3)^2 = 121\) is \(-6\).
