  To solve the equation (x + 3)^2 = 121, we first take the square root of both sides to find the possible values of x + 3. This gives us:
  
  x + 3 = 11 or x + 3 = -11
  
  Next, we solve each equation separately:
  
  1. x + 3 = 11
     x = 11 - 3
     x = 8
  
  2. x + 3 = -11
     x = -11 - 3
     x = -14
  
  Thus, the solutions to the equation are x = 8 and x = -14. The sum of these solutions is:
  
  8 + (-14) = -6
  
  Therefore, the sum of the two values of x that satisfy the equation (x+3)^2 = 121 is -6.
