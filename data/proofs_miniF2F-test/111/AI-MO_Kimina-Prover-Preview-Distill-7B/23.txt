-- First, we substitute $x=0$ to get the constant term.
  have h1 := h₀ 0
  ring_nf at h1

  -- Next, we substitute $x=1$ to get the sum of coefficients.
  have h2 := h₀ 1
  ring_nf at h2

  -- Then, we substitute $x=-1$ to get the alternating sum of coefficients.
  have h3 := h₀ (-1)
  ring_nf at h3

  -- Using these equations, we can determine $a$ and $b$.
  have ha : a = 2 := by linarith
  have hb : b = 3 := by linarith

  -- Finally, we compute $ab + b$.
