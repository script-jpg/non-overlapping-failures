-- First, we substitute $x=0$ to get the constant term $-24=-8 \cdot 3$, which confirms the constant terms of each factor.

  have h₁ := h₀ 0
  simp at h₁

  -- Next, we substitute $x=1$ to get $10-1-24=(a-8)(b+3)$, which gives $-13=(a-8)(b+3)$.

  have h₂ := h₀ 1
  simp at h₂

  -- Then, we substitute $x=-1$ to get $10-(-1)-24=(a(-1)-8)(b(-1)+3)$, which gives $-12=(a-8)(b+3)$.

  have h₃ := h₀ (-1)
  simp at h₃

  -- From the last two equations, we have $-13=(a-8)(b+3)$ and $-12=(a-8)(b+3)$. These are clearly contradictory.
