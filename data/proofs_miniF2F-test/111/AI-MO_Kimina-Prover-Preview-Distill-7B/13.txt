-- First, we substitute $x = 0$ to simplify the equation.
  have h₀' := h₀
  specialize h₀' 0
  simp at h₀'

  -- Now, we have $-24 = (-8)(3)$, which is independent of $a$ and $b$. This confirms the constant term.
  -- Next, we substitute $x = 1$ to get another equation.
  have h₁ := h₀
  specialize h₁ 1
  simp at h₁

  -- With $x = 1$, we have $10(1)^2 - 1 - 24 = (a(1) - 8)(b(1) + 3)$, which simplifies to $-15 = (a - 8)(b + 3)$.
  -- We already know $a * b + b = 12$, as shown in the reference answer, but we need to prove this systematically.

  -- Let's substitute $x = -1$ to get more equations.
  have h₂ := h₀
  specialize h₂ (-1)
  simp at h₂

  -- With $x = -1$, we get $10(-1)^2 - (-1) - 24 = (a(-1) - 8)(b(-1) + 3)$, which simplifies to $-13 = (-a - 8)(-b + 3)$.

  -- Now we have three equations:
  -- 1. $-24 = (-8)(3)$ (constant term)
  -- 2. $-15 = (a - 8)(b + 3)$ (from $x = 1$)
  -- 3. $-13 = (-a - 8)(-b + 3)$ (from $x = -1$)

  -- We can solve these equations to find $a$ and $b$.
  -- From the second equation: $-15 = (a - 8)(b + 3)$
  -- From the third equation: $-13 = (-a - 8)(-b + 3)$

  -- Let's solve these algebraically:
  -- $-15 = (a - 8)(b + 3)$
  -- $-13 = (-a - 8)(-b + 3)$

  -- Expanding both equations:
  -- $-15 = ab + 3a - 8b - 24$
  -- $-13 = ab - 3a + 8b - 24$

  -- Adding both equations:
  -- $-15 + (-13) = (ab + 3a - 8b - 24) + (ab - 3a + 8b - 24)$
  -- $-28 = 2ab - 48$
  -- $2ab = 20$
  -- $ab = 10$

  -- Now, substituting $ab = 10$ into the second equation:
  -- $-15 = ab + 3a - 8b - 24$
  -- $-15 = 10 + 3a - 8b - 24$
  -- $-15 = 3a - 8b - 14$
  -- $3a - 8b = -15 + 14 = -1$

  -- So we have:
  -- $ab = 10$
  -- $3a - 8b = -1$

  -- We can solve this system of equations to find $a$ and $b$.
  -- From $ab = 10$, we get $a = \frac{10}{b}$.
  -- Substituting into $3a - 8b = -1$:
  -- $3(\frac{10}{b}) - 8b = -1$
  -- $\frac{30}{b} - 8b = -1$
  -- Multiplying through by $b$ (assuming $b \neq 0$):
  -- $30 - 8b^2 = -b$
  -- $8b^2 - b - 30 = 0$

  -- This is a quadratic equation in $b$. We can solve it using the quadratic formula:
  -- $b = \frac{-(-1) \pm \sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(8)(-30)}}{2(8)}$
  -- $b = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 960}}{16}$
  -- $b = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{961}}{16}$
  -- $b = \frac{1 \pm 31}{16}$

  -- This gives us two possible solutions for $b$:
  -- $b = \frac{1 + 31}{16} = \frac{32}{16} = 2$
  -- $b = \frac{1 - 31}{16} = \frac{-30}{16} = -\frac{15}{8}$

  -- Since $b$ must be an integer, we discard $b = -\frac{15}{8}$ and accept $b = 2$.
  -- Substituting $b = 2$ into $ab = 10$:
  -- $a \cdot 2 = 10$
  -- $a = \frac{10}{2} = 5$

  -- Therefore, $a = 5$ and $b = 2$.
  -- $AB + B = 5 \cdot 2 + 2 = 10 + 2 = 12$

  -- Let's complete the Lean proof with these calculations:

  have : a * b + b = 12 := by
    -- From the equations obtained by substituting x = 1 and x = -1, we derived that ab = 10 and 3a - 8b = -1
    -- Solving these, we found that a = 5 and b = 2, so ab + b = 12
