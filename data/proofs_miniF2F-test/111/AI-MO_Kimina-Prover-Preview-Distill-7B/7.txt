-- Both sides are polynomials in $x$. Equating coefficients gives $10 = ab$, $-1 = -8a + 3b$ and $-24 = -24a - 8b$.
  have h₁ := h₀ 0
  have h₂ := h₀ 1
  have h₃ := h₀ 2

  simp at h₁ h₂ h₃

  -- $b = 3 - 8a$

  have h₄ : b = 3 - 8 * a := by linarith

  -- $-24 = -24a - 8b$
  -- Substituting $b$ gives $-24 = -24a - 8(3 - 8a) = -24a - 24 + 64a = -24 + 40a$.
  -- Rearranging gives $40a = 0$ so $a = 0$.
  -- But this contradicts $10 = ab$.
  have h₅ : a * b + b = 12 := by linarith
