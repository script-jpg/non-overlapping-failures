-- First, we substitute $x=0$ to get the constant term.
  have h1 := h₀ 0
  simp at h1

  -- Next, we substitute $x=1$ to get the sum of coefficients.
  have h2 := h₀ 1
  simp at h2

  -- Then, we substitute $x=-1$ to get the alternating sum of coefficients.
  have h3 := h₀ (-1)
  simp at h3

  -- Solve for $a$ and $b$.
  have ha : a = 3 := by linarith
  have hb : b = 2 := by linarith

  -- Substitute the values of $a$ and $b$ into the expression $ab+b$.
  rw [ha, hb]

  -- Verify that the result is 12.
