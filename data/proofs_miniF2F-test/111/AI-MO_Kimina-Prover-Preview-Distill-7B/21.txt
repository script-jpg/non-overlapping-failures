-- First, we substitute $x=0$ to get the constant term.
  have h1 := h₀ 0
  ring_nf at h1

  -- Next, we substitute $x=1$ to get a sum of coefficients.
  have h2 := h₀ 1
  ring_nf at h2

  -- Then, we substitute $x=-1$ to get an alternating sum of coefficients.
  have h3 := h₀ (-1)
  ring_nf at h3

  -- Using these equations, we can determine the values of $A$ and $B$.
  -- $h1$ gives us: $-24 = (-8)(3)$ which is true, so no new information.
  -- $h2$ gives us: $10 - 1 - 24 = (A-8)(B+3)$ which simplifies to $-15 = (A-8)(B+3)$.
  -- $h3$ gives us: $10 - (-1) - 24 = (A(-1)-8)(B(-1)+3)$ which simplifies to $-13 = (-A-8)(-B+3)$.

  -- From $h2$: $-15 = (A-8)(B+3)$
  -- From $h3$: $-13 = (-A-8)(-B+3)$

  -- Solving these equations, we get $A = 5$ and $B = -4$.
  have ha : a = 5 := by
    nlinarith
  have hb : b = -4 := by
    nlinarith

  -- Therefore, $AB + B = 5(-4) + (-4) = -20 - 4 = -24$.
