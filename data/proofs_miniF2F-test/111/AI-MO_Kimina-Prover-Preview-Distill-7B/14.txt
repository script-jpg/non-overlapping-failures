-- First, we substitute $x = 0$ to simplify the equation.
  have h₁ := h₀ 0
  simp at h₁

  -- Then, we substitute $x = 1$ to further simplify.
  have h₂ := h₀ 1
  simp at h₂

  -- After simplification, we get a system of equations:
  -- 1. $10 \cdot 0^2 - 0 - 24 = (a \cdot 0 - 8)(b \cdot 0 + 3) \implies -24 = (-8)(3)$ which is true.
  -- 2. $10 \cdot 1^2 - 1 - 24 = (a \cdot 1 - 8)(b \cdot 1 + 3) \implies 10 - 1 - 24 = (a - 8)(b + 3)$
  --    which simplifies to $-15 = (a - 8)(b + 3)$.
  have h₃ : (a - 8) * (b + 3) = -15 := by linarith

  -- We also have the equation from substituting $x = -1$:
  have h₄ := h₀ (-1)
  simp at h₄

  -- 3. $10 \cdot (-1)^2 - (-1) - 24 = (a \cdot (-1) - 8)(b \cdot (-1) + 3)$
  --    which simplifies to $10 + 1 - 24 = (-a - 8)(-b + 3)$
  --    or $-13 = (-a - 8)(-b + 3)$.
  have h₅ : (a + 8) * (b - 3) = -13 := by linarith

  -- We now have two equations:
  -- 1. $(a - 8)(b + 3) = -15$
  -- 2. $(a + 8)(b - 3) = -13$
  -- We can solve these equations to find $a$ and $b$.

  -- Adding the two equations:
  -- $(a - 8)(b + 3) + (a + 8)(b - 3) = -15 + (-13)$
  -- $ab + 3a - 8b - 24 + ab - 3a + 8b - 24 = -28$
  -- $2ab - 48 = -28$
  -- $2ab = 20$
  -- $ab = 10$

    have h₆ := h₀ 2
    simp at h₆
    have h₇ := h₀ (-2)

  -- Now, we find $AB + B$:
  -- $AB + B = B(A + 1) = B \cdot a \cdot (a + 1) = a(a + 1)b$
  -- From $(a - 8)(b + 3) = -15$, we have $ab + 3a - 8b - 24 = -15$
  -- Rearranging: $ab + 3a - 8b = 9$
  -- From $(a + 8)(b - 3) = -13$, we have $ab - 3a + 8b - 24 = -13$
  -- Rearranging: $ab - 3a + 8b = 11$
  -- Adding these two equations:
  -- $(ab + 3a - 8b) + (ab - 3a + 8b) = 9 + 11$
  -- $2ab = 20$
  -- $ab = 10$ (which we already knew)
  -- But we can also solve for $a(a + 1)b$ directly:
  -- From $ab = 10$ and $(a - 8)(b + 3) = -15$:
  -- $ab + 3a - 8b = 9$
  -- $10 + 3a - 8b = 9$
  -- $3a - 8b = -1$
  -- We can solve for $a$ and $b$ from these equations.
