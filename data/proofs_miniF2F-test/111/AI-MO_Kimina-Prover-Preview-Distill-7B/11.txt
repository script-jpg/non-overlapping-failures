  -- After substituting three different values for x and simplifying, we get a system of equations:
  -- 1. -8 * 3 = -24 (trivial)
  -- 2. (a - 8) * (b + 3) = 10 - 1 - 24 = -15
  -- 3. (2a - 8) * (2b + 3) = 40 - 2 - 24 = 14

  -- From the second equation, after factoring -15, we get pairs: (1, -15), (3, -5), (5, -3), (15, -1)
  -- From the third equation, after factoring 14, we get pairs: (1, 14), (2, 7), (7, 2), (14, 1)
  -- The only common pair is (5, -3), which corresponds to (a, b) = (5, -3).

  -- Thus, A = 5, B = -3, and AB + B = 5 * (-3) + (-3) = -15 + (-3) = -18.

  -- The answer is $\boxed{-18}$.
