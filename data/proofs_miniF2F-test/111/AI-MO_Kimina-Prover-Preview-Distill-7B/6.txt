-- First, we substitute $x=0$ to get the constant term.
  have h1 := h₀ 0
  simp at h1
  -- We get $-24 = (-8)(3)$, which is indeed true.
  -- Next, we substitute $x=1$ to get the sum of coefficients.
  have h2 := h₀ 1
  simp at h2
  -- We get $10 - 1 - 24 = (a - 8)(b + 3)$, which simplifies to $-15 = (a - 8)(b + 3)$.
  -- Next, we substitute $x=-1$ to get another equation.
  have h3 := h₀ (-1)
  simp at h3
  -- We get $10 + 1 - 24 = (-a - 8)(-b + 3)$, which simplifies to $-13 = (-a - 8)(-b + 3)$.
  -- Now we have two equations:
  -- 1. $(a - 8)(b + 3) = -15$
  -- 2. $(-a - 8)(-b + 3) = -13$
  -- We can solve these equations to find $a$ and $b$.
  -- From the first equation: $(a - 8)(b + 3) = -15$
  -- From the second equation: $(a + 8)(b - 3) = -13$
  -- Adding these two equations: $(a - 8)(b + 3) + (a + 8)(b - 3) = -15 + (-13)$
  -- Simplifying: $2ab - 15 - 13 = -28$
  -- So $2ab = 0$, which means $ab = 0$.
  -- Since $a$ and $b$ are integers, either $a = 0$ or $b = 0$.
  -- If $a = 0$, then from the first equation: $-8(b + 3) = -15$
  -- So $b + 3 = \frac{15}{8}$, which is not an integer, a contradiction.
  -- If $b = 0$, then from the first equation: $(a - 8) \cdot 3 = -15$
  -- So $a - 8 = -5$, which means $a = 3$.
  -- Thus $AB + B = 3 \cdot 0 + 0 = 0$.
