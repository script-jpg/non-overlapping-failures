  To solve the problem, we start by substituting specific values of \( x \) into the given polynomial equation to form a system of equations. We choose \( x = 1 \), \( x = 0 \), and \( x = -3 \) to generate three equations that can be solved simultaneously to determine the values of \( a \) and \( b \). Once we have these values, we substitute them into the expression \( ab + b \) to verify that it equals 12.
