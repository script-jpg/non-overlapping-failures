  To solve the problem, we start by using the given polynomial equation \(10x^2 - x - 24 = (Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\) and expanding the right-hand side to match the left-hand side. By comparing coefficients, we determine the values of \(A\) and \(B\). We then substitute these values into the expression \(AB + B\) and simplify to verify that it equals 12.
