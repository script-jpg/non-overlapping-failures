  To solve the problem, we need to verify that the expression \(10x^2 - x - 24\) can be factored as \((Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\) where \(A\) and \(B\) are integers, and then determine the value of \(AB + B\).
  1. Substitute \(x = 0\) into the given equation to obtain an equation involving \(a\) and \(b\).
  2. Substitute \(x = 1\) into the given equation to obtain another equation involving \(a\) and \(b\).
  3. Substitute \(x = -1\) into the given equation to obtain a third equation involving \(a\) and \(b\).
  4. Substitute \(x = 2\) into the given equation to obtain a fourth equation involving \(a\) and \(b\).
  5. Use these equations to solve for \(a\) and \(b\) and verify that \(ab + b = 12\).
