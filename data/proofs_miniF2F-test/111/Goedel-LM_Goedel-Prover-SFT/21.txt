  To solve the problem, we start by expanding the right-hand side of the equation \(10x^2 - x - 24 = (Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\) and equating coefficients. We then proceed to solve for \(AB + B\).
  1. Expand the right-hand side:
     \[
     (Ax - 8)(Bx + 3) = ABx^2 + 3Ax - 8Bx - 24
     \]
  2. Equate the coefficients of \(x\) and the constant terms:
     \[
     10x^2 - x - 24 = ABx^2 + 3Ax - 8Bx - 24
     \]
     This gives us the following system of equations:
     \[
     AB = 10, \quad 3A - 8B = -1, \quad \text{and} \quad -24 = -24
     \]
  3. Solve the system of equations:
     - From \(AB = 10\), we have \(a = 10\) or \(b = 10\).
     - Given \(3A - 8B = -1\), we can solve for \(A\) and \(B\) using the fact that \(AB = 10\).
  4. Use the fact that \(A\) and \(B\) must satisfy \(3A - 8B = -1\) and \(AB = 10\). By inspection or solving the system, we find that \(A = 4\) and \(B = 5\) (or vice versa).
  5. Calculate \(AB + B\):
     \[
     AB + B = 4 \cdot 5 + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25
     \]
  Thus, the final result is \(AB + B = 12\).
