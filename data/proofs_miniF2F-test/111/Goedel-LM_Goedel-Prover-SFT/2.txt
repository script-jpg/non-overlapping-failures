  We need to show that the expression \(10x^2 - x - 24\) can be written as \((Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\), where \(A\) and \(B\) are integers, and that \(AB + B = 12\).
  1. Substitute \(x = 0\) into the expression \(10x^2 - x - 24\):
     \[
     10(0)^2 - 0 - 24 = -24
     \]
     This gives us the equation:
     \[
     (A \cdot 0 - 8)(B \cdot 0 + 3) = -24 \implies -8 \cdot 3 = -24
     \]
     which is true.
  2. Substitute \(x = 1\) into the expression \(10x^2 - x - 24\):
     \[
     10(1)^2 - 1 - 24 = 10 - 1 - 24 = -15
     \]
     This gives us the equation:
     \[
     (A \cdot 1 - 8)(B \cdot 1 + 3) = -15 \implies (A - 8)(B + 3) = -15
     \]
  3. Substitute \(x = -1\) into the expression \(10x^2 - x - 24\):
     \[
     10(-1)^2 - (-1) - 24 = 10 + 1 - 24 = -13
     \]
     This gives us the equation:
     \[
     (A \cdot (-1) - 8)(B \cdot (-1) + 3) = -13 \implies (A - 8)(-B + 3) = -13
     \]
  4. Substitute \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) into the expression \(10x^2 - x - 24\):
     \[
     10\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 - \frac{1}{2} - 24 = 10 \cdot \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{2} - 24 = \frac{5}{2} - \frac{1}{2} - 24 = -24
     \]
     This gives us the equation:
     \[
     (A \cdot \frac{1}{2} - 8)(B \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 3) = -24 \implies (A \cdot \frac{1}{2} - 8)(B \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 3) = -24
     \]
  5. Solving the system of equations derived from the above substitutions, we find that \(A = 4\) and \(B = -3\).
  6. Therefore, \(AB + B = 4 \cdot (-3) + (-3) = -12 - 3 = -15\).
