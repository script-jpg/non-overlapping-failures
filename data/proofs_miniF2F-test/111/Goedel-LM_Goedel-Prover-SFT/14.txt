  Given the polynomial \(10x^2 - x - 24\), we need to show that it can be factored as \((Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\) for some integers \(A\) and \(B\). We then need to determine the value of \(AB + B\).
  1. Substitute \(x = 0\) into the polynomial and the factored form to get \(-24 = (-8)(3)\).
  2. Substitute \(x = 1\) into the polynomial and the factored form to get \(10 - 1 - 24 = (A - 8)(B + 3)\).
  3. Substitute \(x = -1\) into the polynomial and the factored form to get \(10 + 1 - 24 = (A + 8)(B - 3)\).
  4. Simplify the equations obtained from the substitutions to find the values of \(A\) and \(B\).
  5. Use the values of \(A\) and \(B\) to compute \(AB + B\).
