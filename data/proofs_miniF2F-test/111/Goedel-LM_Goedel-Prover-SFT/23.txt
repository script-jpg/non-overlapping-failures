  Given the expression \(10x^2 - x - 24\) can be written as \((Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\), where \(A\) and \(B\) are integers, we need to find \(AB + B\) and show that it equals 12.
  1. Substitute \(x = 0\) into the expression \(10x^2 - x - 24 = (Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\). This gives \(-24 = -8B\), which simplifies to \(B = 3\).
  2. Substitute \(x = 1\) into the expression \(10x^2 - x - 24 = (Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\). This gives \(10 - 1 - 24 = (A - 8)(3 + 3)\), which simplifies to \(-15 = 6(A - 8)\), leading to \(A = 7\).
  3. Substitute \(x = -3\) into the expression \(10x^2 - x - 24 = (Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\). This gives \(90 + 3 - 24 = (-A - 8)(-B + 3)\), which simplifies to \(75 = (-A - 8)(-B + 3)\).
  4. Substitute \(x = 4\) into the expression \(10x^2 - x - 24 = (Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\). This gives \(240 - 4 - 24 = (4A - 8)(4B + 3)\), which simplifies to \(212 = (4A - 8)(4B + 3)\).
  From these equations, we can solve for \(A\) and \(B\) and verify that \(AB + B = 12\).
