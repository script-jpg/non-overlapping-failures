  To solve the problem, we start by equating the given expression \(10x^2 - x - 24\) to the factored form \((Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\). We then evaluate this factorization at specific values of \(x\) to determine the values of \(A\) and \(B\). By substituting \(x = 0\), \(x = 1\), and \(x = -1\), we obtain a system of equations that can be solved to find \(A\) and \(B\). Finally, we compute \(AB + B\) to verify that it equals 12.
