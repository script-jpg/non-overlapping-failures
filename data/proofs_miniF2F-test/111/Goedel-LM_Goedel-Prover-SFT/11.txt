  Given the polynomial \(10x^2 - x - 24\) that can be factored as \((Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\), we need to determine the integers \(A\) and \(B\) such that \(AB + B = 12\). We start by evaluating the polynomial at specific values of \(x\) to form a system of equations. By substituting \(x = 1\), \(x = 0\), and \(x = -1\), we obtain three equations that can be solved to find \(A\) and \(B\). Finally, we verify that \(AB + B = 12\).
