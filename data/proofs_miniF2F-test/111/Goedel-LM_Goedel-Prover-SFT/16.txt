  Given the polynomial \(10x^2 - x - 24\), we need to show that it can be factored as \((Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\) where \(A\) and \(B\) are integers, and that \(AB + B = 12\).
  1. Substitute \(x = 1\) into the polynomial and the factored form to get an equation involving \(a\) and \(b\).
  2. Substitute \(x = 0\) into the polynomial and the factored form to get another equation involving \(a\) and \(b\).
  3. Substitute \(x = -1\) into the polynomial and the factored form to get a third equation involving \(a\) and \(b\).
  4. Use these equations to solve for \(a\) and \(b\) and verify that \(AB + B = 12\).
