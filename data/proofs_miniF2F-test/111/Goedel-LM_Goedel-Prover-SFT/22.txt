  To solve the problem, we start by substituting specific values of \( x \) into the given equation \( 10x^2 - x - 24 = (Ax - 8)(Bx + 3) \) to form a system of equations. We choose \( x = 0 \), \( x = 1 \), and \( x = -1 \) to generate three equations that can be solved to find the values of \( A \) and \( B \). By simplifying these equations and solving for \( A \) and \( B \), we determine that \( A = 5 \) and \( B = -3 \). Finally, we compute \( AB + B \) to verify that it equals 12.
