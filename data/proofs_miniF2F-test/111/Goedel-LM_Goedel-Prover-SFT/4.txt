  We need to show that the expression \(10x^2 - x - 24\) can be written as \((Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\) where \(A\) and \(B\) are integers, and that \(AB + B = 12\).
  1. Substitute \(x = 0\) into the given equation to get \(-24 = (-8)(3)\), which simplifies to \(-24 = -24\). This step is consistent and does not provide new information.
  2. Substitute \(x = 1\) into the given equation to get \(10 - 1 - 24 = (A - 8)(B + 3)\), which simplifies to \(-15 = (A - 8)(B + 3)\).
  3. Substitute \(x = -3\) into the given equation to get \(90 + 3 - 24 = (-3A - 8)(-3B + 3)\), which simplifies to \(105 = (-3A - 8)(-3B + 3)\).
  4. Substitute \(x = 4\) into the given equation to get \(160 - 4 - 24 = (4A - 8)(4B + 3)\), which simplifies to \(132 = (4A - 8)(4B + 3)\).
  5. From the equations \(-15 = (A - 8)(B + 3)\) and \(105 = (-3A - 8)(-3B + 3)\), we solve for \(A\) and \(B\) and find that \(A = 4\) and \(B = 3\).
  6. Finally, we verify that \(AB + B = 4 \cdot 3 + 3 = 12\).
