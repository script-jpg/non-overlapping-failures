  To solve the problem, we start by equating the given polynomial expression \(10x^2 - x - 24\) to the factored form \((Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\). We then evaluate this equality at specific values of \(x\) to derive the values of \(A\) and \(B\). By substituting \(x = 0\), \(x = 1\), and \(x = -1\), we obtain a system of equations that can be solved to find \(A\) and \(B\). Finally, we compute the sum \(AB + B\) and verify that it equals 12.
