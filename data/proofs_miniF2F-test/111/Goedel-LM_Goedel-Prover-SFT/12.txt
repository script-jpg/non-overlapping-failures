  To solve the problem, we start by equating the given polynomial expression to the product of two linear factors. We then evaluate the polynomial at specific points to form a system of equations that can be solved to find the values of \(a\) and \(b\). By substituting \(x = 1\), \(x = 0\), and \(x = -1\) into the polynomial and the factored form, we obtain three equations that can be solved to determine \(a\) and \(b\). Finally, we verify that \(a \cdot b + b = 12\).
