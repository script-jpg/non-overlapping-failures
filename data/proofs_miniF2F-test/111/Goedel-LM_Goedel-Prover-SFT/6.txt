  To solve the problem, we start by using the given equation \(10x^2 - x - 24 = (Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\) for specific values of \(x\) to determine the integers \(A\) and \(B\). We then use these values to compute \(AB + B\) and verify that it equals 12.
  1. Substitute \(x = 1\) into the equation to get \(10 \cdot 1^2 - 1 - 24 = (A \cdot 1 - 8)(B \cdot 1 + 3)\), which simplifies to \(-25 = (A - 8)(B + 3)\).
  2. Substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation to get \(10 \cdot 0^2 - 0 - 24 = (A \cdot 0 - 8)(B \cdot 0 + 3)\), which simplifies to \(-24 = -8 \cdot 3\).
  3. Substitute \(x = -1\) into the equation to get \(10 \cdot (-1)^2 - (-1) - 24 = (A \cdot (-1) - 8)(B \cdot (-1) + 3)\), which simplifies to \(10 + 1 - 24 = (-A - 8)(-B + 3)\).
  From these equations, we can deduce the values of \(A\) and \(B\) and verify that \(AB + B = 12\).
