  Given the expression \(10x^2 - x - 24\) can be factored as \((Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\), where \(A\) and \(B\) are integers, we need to show that \(AB + B = 12\). We will use specific values of \(x\) to derive the necessary equations and solve for \(A\) and \(B\).
  1. Substitute \(x = 0\) into the equation:
     \[
     10(0)^2 - 0 - 24 = (A(0) - 8)(B(0) + 3) \implies -24 = (-8)(3)
     \]
     This confirms the factorization.
  2. Substitute \(x = 1\) into the equation:
     \[
     10(1)^2 - 1 - 24 = (A(1) - 8)(B(1) + 3) \implies 10 - 1 - 24 = (A - 8)(B + 3) \implies -15 = (A - 8)(B + 3)
     \]
  3. Substitute \(x = -1\) into the equation:
     \[
     10(-1)^2 - (-1) - 24 = (A(-1) - 8)(B(-1) + 3) \implies 10 + 1 - 24 = (-A - 8)(-B + 3) \implies -15 = (-A - 8)(-B + 3)
     \]
  4. Substitute \(x = 2\) into the equation:
     \[
     10(2)^2 - 2 - 24 = (A(2) - 8)(B(2) + 3) \implies 40 - 2 - 24 = (2A - 8)(2B + 3) \implies 14 = (2A - 8)(2B + 3)
     \]
  From these equations, we can solve for \(A\) and \(B\). Using the derived equations, we find that \(A = 2\) and \(B = 3\). Therefore, \(AB + B = 2 \cdot 3 + 3 = 9\).
