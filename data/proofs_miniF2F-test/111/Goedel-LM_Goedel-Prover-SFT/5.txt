  To solve the problem, we start by substituting specific values of \( x \) into the given equation \( 10x^2 - x - 24 = (Ax - 8)(Bx + 3) \) to form a system of equations. We choose \( x = 1 \), \( x = 0 \), and \( x = -3 \) to maximize the simplicity of the resulting equations. By substituting these values and simplifying, we obtain three equations that can be solved to find the values of \( A \) and \( B \). Finally, we sum \( AB \) and \( B \) to verify that their sum equals 12.
