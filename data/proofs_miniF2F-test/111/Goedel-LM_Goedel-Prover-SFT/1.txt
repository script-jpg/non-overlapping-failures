  To solve the problem, we start by expanding the right-hand side of the equation \( (Ax - 8)(Bx + 3) \) and equating it to the left-hand side \( 10x^2 - x - 24 \). By comparing coefficients, we obtain a system of equations that can be solved to find the values of \( A \) and \( B \). Finally, we compute \( AB + B \) to verify that it equals 12.
