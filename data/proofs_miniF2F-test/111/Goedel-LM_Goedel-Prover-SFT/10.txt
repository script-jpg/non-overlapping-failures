  To solve the problem, we start by expanding the given expression \(10x^2 - x - 24\) and equating it to \((Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\). We then evaluate this expression at specific values of \(x\) to find the values of \(A\) and \(B\). By substituting \(x = 0\), \(x = 1\), and \(x = -1\), we obtain three equations that can be solved to determine \(A\) and \(B\). Finally, we verify that \(AB + B = 12\).
