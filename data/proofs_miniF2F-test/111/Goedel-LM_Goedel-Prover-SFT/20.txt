  To solve the problem, we start by equating the given polynomial expression to the factored form \((Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\). We then evaluate this polynomial at specific points \(x = 0\), \(x = 1\), \(x = -1\), and \(x = 2\) to obtain a system of equations. By simplifying these equations, we derive the values of \(A\) and \(B\). Finally, we compute the sum \(AB + B\) and verify that it equals 12.
