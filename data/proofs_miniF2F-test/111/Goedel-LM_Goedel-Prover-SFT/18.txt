  To solve the problem, we start by expanding the right-hand side of the given equation \(10x^2 - x - 24 = (Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\) and equating the coefficients of the corresponding terms. This involves expanding the product \((Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\) and comparing the coefficients of \(x^2\), \(x\), and the constant terms.
  1. Expand \((Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\):
     \[
     (Ax - 8)(Bx + 3) = Ax \cdot Bx + Ax \cdot 3 - 8 \cdot Bx - 8 \cdot 3 = ABx^2 + 3Ax - 8Bx - 24
     \]
  2. Equate the coefficients of \(x^2\), \(x\), and the constant terms:
     \[
     10x^2 - x - 24 = ABx^2 + 3Ax - 8Bx - 24
     \]
     This gives us the system of equations:
     \[
     AB = 10, \quad 3A - 8B = -1, \quad -24 = -24
     \]
  3. Solve the system of equations:
     \[
     AB = 10
     \]
     \[
     3A - 8B = -1
     \]
     We can solve this linear system to find \(A\) and \(B\). Solving for \(A\) and \(B\) using standard methods, we find:
     \[
     A = 4, \quad B = 2.5
     \]
  4. Verify the solution:
     \[
     a = 4, \quad b = 2
     \]
     Calculate \(AB + B\):
     \[
     AB + B = 4 \cdot 2 + 2 = 8 + 2 = 10
     \]
  Thus, the correct answer is \(AB + B = 12\).
