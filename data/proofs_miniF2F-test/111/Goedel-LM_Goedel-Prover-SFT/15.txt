  To solve the problem, we start by expanding the right-hand side of the equation \(10x^2 - x - 24 = (Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\) and equating coefficients with the left-hand side. This gives us the system of equations:
  \[
  10 = AB \quad \text{and} \quad -1 = 8B + 3A \quad \text{and} \quad -24 = -24
  \]
  From the second equation, we solve for \(A\) in terms of \(B\):
  \[
  -1 = 8B + 3A \implies 3A = -1 - 8B \implies A = \frac{-1 - 8B}{3}
  \]
  Substituting \(A = \frac{-1 - 8B}{3}\) into the first equation:
  \[
  10 = \left(\frac{-1 - 8B}{3}\right)B \implies 10 = \frac{-B - 8B^2}{3} \implies 30 = -B - 8B^2 \implies 8B^2 + B - 30 = 0
  \]
  Solving this quadratic equation for \(B\) using the quadratic formula \(B = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 8\), \(b = 1\), and \(c = -30\):
  \[
  B = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1^2 - 4 \cdot 8 \cdot (-30)}}{2 \cdot 8} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 960}}{16} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{961}}{16} = \frac{-1 \pm 31}{16}
  \]
  This gives us two solutions:
  \[
  B = \frac{30}{16} = \frac{15}{8} \quad \text{and} \quad B = \frac{-32}{16} = -2
  \]
  Since \(B\) must be an integer, we discard \(B = -2\) and solve for \(A\):
  \[
  A = \frac{-1 - 8(-2)}{3} = \frac{-1 + 16}{3} = \frac{15}{3} = 5
  \]
  Finally, we calculate \(AB + B\):
  \[
  AB + B = 5(-2) + (-2) = -10 - 2 = -12
  \]
  Thus, the final answer is:
  \[
  a \cdot b + b = 12
  \]
