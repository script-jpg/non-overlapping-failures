  To solve the problem, we start by expanding the right-hand side of the equation \(10x^2 - x - 24 = (Ax - 8)(Bx + 3)\) and equating it to the left-hand side. By comparing coefficients, we determine the values of \(A\) and \(B\). Finally, we compute \(AB + B\) and verify that it equals 12.

  -- Substitute specific values of x into the equation to generate a system of equations.
  have h₁ := h₀ 1
  have h₂ := h₀ (-3 / 4)
  have h₃ := h₀ (8 / 5)
  -- Simplify the resulting equations to find the values of a and b.
  norm_num at h₁ h₂ h₃
  -- Use the simplified equations to solve for a and b and verify the final result.
