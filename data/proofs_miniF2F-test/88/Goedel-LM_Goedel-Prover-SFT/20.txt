  Given three consecutive positive even numbers, we need to find the product of these numbers divided by 8, and show that it equals 32736. Let the three numbers be \( n-2 \), \( n \), and \( n+2 \). We are given that the sum of their squares equals 12296. We start by expressing the sum of the squares in terms of \( n \):
  \[
  (n-2)^2 + n^2 + (n+2)^2 = 12296
  \]
  Expanding each term, we get:
  \[
  (n^2 - 4n + 4) + n^2 + (n^2 + 4n + 4) = 12296
  \]
  Combining like terms, we have:
  \[
  3n^2 + 8 = 12296
  \]
  Subtracting 8 from both sides, we obtain:
  \[
  3n^2 = 12288
  \]
  Dividing both sides by 3, we find:
  \[
  n^2 = 4096
  \]
  Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
  \[
  n = 64
  \]
  Thus, the three numbers are \( 62 \), \( 64 \), and \( 66 \). We need to verify that the product of these numbers divided by 8 equals 32736:
  \[
  \frac{62 \cdot 64 \cdot 66}{8} = 32736
  \]
  Calculating the product of the numbers:
  \[
  62 \cdot 64 = 3968
  \]
  \[
  3968 \cdot 66 = 259968
  \]
  Dividing by 8:
  \[
  \frac{259968}{8} = 32736
  \]
  Thus, the product of the three numbers divided by 8 is indeed 32736.
