  Given that the sum of the squares of three consecutive positive even numbers is 12296, we need to find the product of these three numbers divided by 8. We are to show that this product is 32736.
  Let the three consecutive even numbers be \( n-2 \), \( n \), and \( n+2 \). The sum of their squares is given by:
  \[
  (n-2)^2 + n^2 + (n+2)^2 = 12296
  \]
  First, we simplify the left-hand side:
  \[
  (n-2)^2 + n^2 + (n+2)^2 = (n^2 - 4n + 4) + n^2 + (n^2 + 4n + 4) = 3n^2 + 8
  \]
  Thus, we have:
  \[
  3n^2 + 8 = 12296
  \]
  Subtracting 8 from both sides:
  \[
  3n^2 = 12288
  \]
  Dividing both sides by 3:
  \[
  n^2 = 4096
  \]
  Taking the square root of both sides:
  \[
  n = 64
  \]
  Now, we calculate the product of the three numbers divided by 8:
  \[
  \frac{(n-2) \cdot n \cdot (n+2)}{8} = \frac{(64-2) \cdot 64 \cdot (64+2)}{8} = \frac{62 \cdot 64 \cdot 66}{8}
  \]
  Simplifying further:
  \[
  \frac{62 \cdot 64 \cdot 66}{8} = \frac{62 \cdot 64 \cdot 66}{2 \cdot 4} = \frac{62 \cdot 64 \cdot 66}{2} = 62 \cdot 32 \cdot 33 = 32736
  \]
  Thus, the product of the three numbers divided by 8 is 32736.
