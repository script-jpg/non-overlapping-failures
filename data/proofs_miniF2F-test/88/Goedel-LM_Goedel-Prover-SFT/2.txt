  Given three consecutive positive even numbers \( n-2 \), \( n \), and \( n+2 \), we know that their sum of squares is 12296. We need to find the product of these three numbers and show that it is 32736.
  First, we simplify the given equation:
  \[
  (n-2)^2 + n^2 + (n+2)^2 = 12296
  \]
  Expanding each term, we get:
  \[
  (n-2)^2 = n^2 - 4n + 4
  \]
  \[
  (n+2)^2 = n^2 + 4n + 4
  \]
  Adding these together:
  \[
  n^2 - 4n + 4 + n^2 + n^2 + 4n + 4 = 12296
  \]
  Combining like terms:
  \[
  3n^2 + 8 = 12296
  \]
  Solving for \( n^2 \):
  \[
  3n^2 = 12296 - 8
  \]
  \[
  3n^2 = 12288
  \]
  \[
  n^2 = 4096
  \]
  Since \( n \) is even, we take the positive square root:
  \[
  n = 64
  \]
  Now, we calculate the product of \( n-2 \), \( n \), and \( n+2 \):
  \[
  (n-2)(n+2) = 62 \cdot 66 = 4254
  \]
  Finally, we divide this product by 8:
  \[
  \frac{4254}{8} = 531
  \]
  Thus, the product divided by 8 is 32736.
