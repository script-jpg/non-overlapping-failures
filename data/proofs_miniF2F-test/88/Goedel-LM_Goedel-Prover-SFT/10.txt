  Given three consecutive positive even numbers \( n-2 \), \( n \), and \( n+2 \), we know that the sum of their squares is 12296. We need to find the product of these three numbers and show that it is 32736.
  First, we express the sum of the squares of the three numbers:
  \[
  (n-2)^2 + n^2 + (n+2)^2 = 12296
  \]
  Expanding each term, we get:
  \[
  (n-2)^2 = n^2 - 4n + 4
  \]
  \[
  (n+2)^2 = n^2 + 4n + 4
  \]
  Adding these together:
  \[
  n^2 - 4n + 4 + n^2 + n^2 + 4n + 4 = 12296
  \]
  Simplifying the left-hand side:
  \[
  3n^2 + 8 = 12296
  \]
  Subtracting 8 from both sides:
  \[
  3n^2 = 12288
  \]
  Dividing by 3:
  \[
  n^2 = 4096
  \]
  Taking the square root of both sides:
  \[
  n = 64 \quad \text{(since \( n \) is even)}
  \]
  Thus, the three numbers are \( 64-2 \), \( 64 \), and \( 64+2 \). We calculate their product:
  \[
  (64-2) \times 64 \times (64+2) = 62 \times 64 \times 66
  \]
  We then divide by 8:
  \[
  \frac{62 \times 64 \times 66}{8} = 32736
  \]
