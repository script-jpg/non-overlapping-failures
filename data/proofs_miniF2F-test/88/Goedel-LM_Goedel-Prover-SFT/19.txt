  Given three consecutive positive even numbers \( n - 2 \), \( n \), and \( n + 2 \), we know that the sum of their squares is 12296. We need to find the product of these three numbers divided by 8 and show that it equals 32736.
  First, we express the sum of the squares:
  \[
  (n - 2)^2 + n^2 + (n + 2)^2 = 12296
  \]
  Expanding each term, we get:
  \[
  (n^2 - 4n + 4) + n^2 + (n^2 + 4n + 4) = 12296
  \]
  Combining like terms, we have:
  \[
  3n^2 + 8 = 12296
  \]
  Solving for \( n^2 \):
  \[
  3n^2 = 12288 \implies n^2 = 4096
  \]
  Since \( n \) is even, we find \( n \) by taking the square root of both sides:
  \[
  n = 64
  \]
  Next, we calculate the product of the three numbers:
  \[
  (n - 2) \cdot n \cdot (n + 2) = 62 \cdot 64 \cdot 66
  \]
  We find the product step-by-step:
  \[
  62 \cdot 64 = 3968
  \]
  \[
  3968 \cdot 66 = 261872
  \]
  Finally, we divide the product by 8:
  \[
  \frac{261872}{8} = 32736
  \]
  Thus, the product of the three numbers divided by 8 is indeed 32736.
