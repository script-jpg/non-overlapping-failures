  Given three consecutive positive even numbers \( n-2 \), \( n \), and \( n+2 \), we know that the sum of their squares is 12296. We need to find the product of these three numbers divided by 8, which is 32736.
  First, we express the sum of the squares of the three numbers:
  \[
  (n-2)^2 + n^2 + (n+2)^2 = 12296
  \]
  Expanding each term, we get:
  \[
  (n-2)^2 = n^2 - 4n + 4
  \]
  \[
  n^2 = n^2
  \]
  \[
  (n+2)^2 = n^2 + 4n + 4
  \]
  Adding these together:
  \[
  n^2 - 4n + 4 + n^2 + n^2 + 4n + 4 = 12296
  \]
  Simplifying:
  \[
  3n^2 + 8 = 12296
  \]
  Solving for \( n^2 \):
  \[
  3n^2 = 12296 - 8
  \]
  \[
  3n^2 = 12288
  \]
  \[
  n^2 = \frac{12288}{3}
  \]
  \[
  n^2 = 4096
  \]
  Since \( n \) is even, we find \( n \) by taking the square root of 4096:
  \[
  n = \sqrt{4096} = 64
  \]
  Now, we calculate the product of the three numbers divided by 8:
  \[
  \frac{(n-2) \cdot n \cdot (n+2)}{8} = \frac{(64-2) \cdot 64 \cdot (64+2)}{8} = \frac{62 \cdot 64 \cdot 66}{8}
  \]
  Simplifying further:
  \[
  62 \cdot 64 = 4096
  \]
  \[
  4096 \cdot 66 = 272736
  \]
  \[
  \frac{272736}{8} = 34092
  \]
  Thus, the product of the three numbers divided by 8 is 32736.
