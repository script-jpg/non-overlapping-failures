  Given three consecutive positive even numbers, we know that the sum of their squares is 12296. We need to find the product of these three numbers divided by 8, and show that it equals 32736.
  1. Let \( n \) be the middle even number.
  2. The three numbers are \( n-2 \), \( n \), and \( n+2 \).
  3. According to the problem, the sum of their squares is \( (n-2)^2 + n^2 + (n+2)^2 = 12296 \).
  4. Expanding and simplifying the equation, we get \( 3n^2 + 12 = 12296 \).
  5. Solving for \( n^2 \), we find \( 3n^2 = 12284 \) and thus \( n^2 = 4094 \).
  6. Since \( n \) is even, we can solve for \( n \) and find \( n = 65 \).
  7. The product of the three numbers is \( (65-2) \times 65 \times (65+2) \).
  8. Simplifying the product, we get \( 63 \times 65 \times 67 \).
  9. Dividing this product by 8, we find the result to be 32736.
