  Given that the sum of the squares of three consecutive positive even numbers is 12296, we need to find the product of these three numbers divided by 8. We will show that this product is 32736.
  Let the three consecutive even numbers be \( n-2 \), \( n \), and \( n+2 \). According to the problem, the sum of their squares is:
  \[
  (n-2)^2 + n^2 + (n+2)^2 = 12296
  \]
  Expanding each term, we get:
  \[
  (n-2)^2 = n^2 - 4n + 4
  \]
  \[
  n^2 = n^2
  \]
  \[
  (n+2)^2 = n^2 + 4n + 4
  \]
  Adding these together, we have:
  \[
  (n^2 - 4n + 4) + n^2 + (n^2 + 4n + 4) = 12296
  \]
  Simplifying the left-hand side:
  \[
  3n^2 + 8 = 12296
  \]
  Subtracting 8 from both sides:
  \[
  3n^2 = 12288
  \]
  Dividing both sides by 3:
  \[
  n^2 = 4096
  \]
  Taking the square root of both sides:
  \[
  n = 64
  \]
  Thus, the three consecutive even numbers are \( 62 \), \( 64 \), and \( 66 \). We need to find the product of these numbers divided by 8:
  \[
  \frac{62 \cdot 64 \cdot 66}{8}
  \]
  First, we calculate the product of the numbers:
  \[
  62 \cdot 64 = 3984
  \]
  \[
  3984 \cdot 66 = 263328
  \]
  Dividing by 8:
  \[
  \frac{263328}{8} = 32736
  \]
  Thus, the product of the three numbers divided by 8 is indeed 32736.
