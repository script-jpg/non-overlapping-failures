  Given three consecutive positive even numbers \( n-2 \), \( n \), and \( n+2 \), we know that the sum of their squares is 12296. We need to show that the product of these numbers divided by 8 is 32736.
  First, we simplify the given equation:
  \[
  (n-2)^2 + n^2 + (n+2)^2 = 12296
  \]
  Expanding each term, we get:
  \[
  (n-2)^2 = n^2 - 4n + 4
  \]
  \[
  n^2 = n^2
  \]
  \[
  (n+2)^2 = n^2 + 4n + 4
  \]
  Adding these together:
  \[
  n^2 - 4n + 4 + n^2 + n^2 + 4n + 4 = 12296
  \]
  \[
  3n^2 + 8 = 12296
  \]
  Subtracting 8 from both sides:
  \[
  3n^2 = 12288
  \]
  Dividing by 3:
  \[
  n^2 = 4096
  \]
  Taking the square root of both sides:
  \[
  n = 64
  \]
  Next, we calculate the product of the numbers:
  \[
  (n-2) \cdot n \cdot (n+2) = (64-2) \cdot 64 \cdot (64+2) = 62 \cdot 64 \cdot 66
  \]
  We then divide this product by 8:
  \[
  \frac{62 \cdot 64 \cdot 66}{8}
  \]
  Simplifying the division:
  \[
  \frac{62 \cdot 64 \cdot 66}{8} = 62 \cdot 8 \cdot 66 = 32736
  \]
  Thus, the product of the three numbers divided by 8 is indeed 32736.
