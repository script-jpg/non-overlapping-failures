  Given three consecutive positive even numbers \( n-2 \), \( n \), and \( n+2 \), we know that the sum of their squares is 12296. We need to find the product of these three numbers divided by 8, which should equal 32736.
  First, we simplify the given equation:
  \[
  (n-2)^2 + n^2 + (n+2)^2 = 12296
  \]
  Expanding each term, we get:
  \[
  (n-2)^2 = n^2 - 4n + 4
  \]
  \[
  n^2 = n^2
  \]
  \[
  (n+2)^2 = n^2 + 4n + 4
  \]
  Adding these together:
  \[
  n^2 - 4n + 4 + n^2 + n^2 + 4n + 4 = 12296
  \]
  Combining like terms:
  \[
  3n^2 + 8 = 12296
  \]
  Solving for \( n^2 \):
  \[
  3n^2 = 12296 - 8
  \]
  \[
  3n^2 = 12288
  \]
  \[
  n^2 = 4096
  \]
  Thus, \( n = 64 \) (since \( n \) is even and positive).
  Next, we calculate the product of the three numbers:
  \[
  (n-2) \cdot n \cdot (n+2) = (64-2) \cdot 64 \cdot (64+2) = 62 \cdot 64 \cdot 66
  \]
  We then divide by 8:
  \[
  \frac{62 \cdot 64 \cdot 66}{8} = 62 \cdot 8 \cdot 66 = 32736
  \]
