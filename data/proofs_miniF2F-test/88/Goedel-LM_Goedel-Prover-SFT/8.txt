  Given three consecutive positive even numbers \( n-2 \), \( n \), and \( n+2 \), we know that the sum of their squares is 12296. We need to find the product of these numbers divided by 8 and show that it equals 32736.
  First, we express the sum of the squares:
  \[
  (n-2)^2 + n^2 + (n+2)^2 = 12296
  \]
  Expanding each term:
  \[
  (n-2)^2 = n^2 - 4n + 4
  \]
  \[
  n^2 = n^2
  \]
  \[
  (n+2)^2 = n^2 + 4n + 4
  \]
  Adding these together:
  \[
  (n^2 - 4n + 4) + n^2 + (n^2 + 4n + 4) = 3n^2 + 8
  \]
  Thus, we have:
  \[
  3n^2 + 8 = 12296
  \]
  Solving for \( n^2 \):
  \[
  3n^2 = 12296 - 8
  \]
  \[
  3n^2 = 12288
  \]
  \[
  n^2 = \frac{12288}{3}
  \]
  \[
  n^2 = 4096
  \]
  Since \( n \) is even, we find \( n \):
  \[
  n = \sqrt{4096} = 64
  \]
  Now, we calculate the product of the numbers:
  \[
  (n-2) \cdot n \cdot (n+2) = (62) \cdot (64) \cdot (66)
  \]
  Dividing by 8:
  \[
  \frac{62 \cdot 64 \cdot 66}{8} = 32736
  \]
  Thus, the product of the numbers divided by 8 is indeed 32736.
