  Given three consecutive positive even numbers \( n-2 \), \( n \), and \( n+2 \), we know that the sum of their squares is \( 12296 \). We need to find the product of these three numbers and show that it equals \( 32736 \).
  First, we simplify the equation for the sum of the squares:
  \[
  (n-2)^2 + n^2 + (n+2)^2 = 12296
  \]
  Expanding each term, we get:
  \[
  (n-2)^2 = n^2 - 4n + 4
  \]
  \[
  n^2 = n^2
  \]
  \[
  (n+2)^2 = n^2 + 4n + 4
  \]
  Adding these together, we have:
  \[
  (n^2 - 4n + 4) + n^2 + (n^2 + 4n + 4) = 12296
  \]
  Combining like terms, we get:
  \[
  3n^2 + 8 = 12296
  \]
  Subtracting 8 from both sides, we obtain:
  \[
  3n^2 = 12288
  \]
  Dividing both sides by 3, we find:
  \[
  n^2 = 4096
  \]
  Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
  \[
  n = 64 \quad \text{(since \( n \) is even)}
  \]
  Next, we calculate the product of the three numbers:
  \[
  (n-2) \cdot n \cdot (n+2) = (64-2) \cdot 64 \cdot (64+2) = 62 \cdot 64 \cdot 66
  \]
  We simplify this product:
  \[
  62 \cdot 64 = 3968
  \]
  \[
  3968 \cdot 66 = 32736
  \]
  Thus, the product of the three numbers is \( 32736 \).
