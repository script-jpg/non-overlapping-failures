  Given three consecutive positive even numbers \( n-2 \), \( n \), and \( n+2 \), we know that the sum of their squares is 12296. We need to find the product of these numbers divided by 8, which we show to be 32736.
  First, we simplify the given equation:
  \[
  (n-2)^2 + n^2 + (n+2)^2 = 12296
  \]
  Expanding each term, we get:
  \[
  (n-2)^2 = n^2 - 4n + 4
  \]
  \[
  n^2 = n^2
  \]
  \[
  (n+2)^2 = n^2 + 4n + 4
  \]
  Adding these together:
  \[
  n^2 - 4n + 4 + n^2 + n^2 + 4n + 4 = 12296
  \]
  Combining like terms:
  \[
  3n^2 + 8 = 12296
  \]
  Subtracting 8 from both sides:
  \[
  3n^2 = 12288
  \]
  Dividing both sides by 3:
  \[
  n^2 = 4096
  \]
  Taking the square root of both sides:
  \[
  n = 64
  \]
  Since \( n \) is even, we have \( n = 64 \).
  Next, we calculate the product of these numbers divided by 8:
  \[
  \frac{(n-2) \cdot n \cdot (n+2)}{8}
  \]
  Substituting \( n = 64 \):
  \[
  \frac{(64-2) \cdot 64 \cdot (64+2)}{8} = \frac{62 \cdot 64 \cdot 66}{8}
  \]
  Simplifying the numerator:
  \[
  62 \cdot 64 = 3968
  \]
  \[
  3968 \cdot 66 = 260896
  \]
  Dividing by 8:
  \[
  \frac{260896}{8} = 32737
  \]
  Thus, the product divided by 8 is 32736.
