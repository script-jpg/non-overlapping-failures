  Given three consecutive positive even numbers \( n-2 \), \( n \), and \( n+2 \), we know that the sum of their squares is 12296. We need to find the product of these three numbers and show that it is 32736 when divided by 8.
  First, we express the sum of the squares:
  \[
  (n-2)^2 + n^2 + (n+2)^2 = 12296
  \]
  Expanding each term:
  \[
  (n-2)^2 = n^2 - 4n + 4
  \]
  \[
  n^2 = n^2
  \]
  \[
  (n+2)^2 = n^2 + 4n + 4
  \]
  Adding these together:
  \[
  n^2 - 4n + 4 + n^2 + n^2 + 4n + 4 = 12296
  \]
  Simplifying the left-hand side:
  \[
  3n^2 + 8 = 12296
  \]
  Solving for \( n^2 \):
  \[
  3n^2 = 12296 - 8
  \]
  \[
  3n^2 = 12288
  \]
  \[
  n^2 = \frac{12288}{3}
  \]
  \[
  n^2 = 4096
  \]
  Thus, \( n = 64 \) since \( n \) is even.
  Next, we calculate the product of the three numbers:
  \[
  (n-2) \times n \times (n+2) = (64-2) \times 64 \times (64+2) = 62 \times 64 \times 66
  \]
  Dividing by 8:
  \[
  \frac{62 \times 64 \times 66}{8} = 32736
  \]
