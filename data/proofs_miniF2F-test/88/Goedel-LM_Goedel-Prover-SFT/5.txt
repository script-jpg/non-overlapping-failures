  Given three consecutive positive even numbers \( n-2 \), \( n \), and \( n+2 \), we know that the sum of their squares is 12296. We need to find the product of these three numbers divided by 8, which is given to be 32736.
  First, we simplify the equation for the sum of the squares:
  \[
  (n-2)^2 + n^2 + (n+2)^2 = 12296
  \]
  Expanding each term, we get:
  \[
  (n-2)^2 = n^2 - 4n + 4
  \]
  \[
  n^2 = n^2
  \]
  \[
  (n+2)^2 = n^2 + 4n + 4
  \]
  Adding these together:
  \[
  n^2 - 4n + 4 + n^2 + n^2 + 4n + 4 = 12296
  \]
  Simplifying, we find:
  \[
  3n^2 + 8 = 12296
  \]
  Solving for \( n^2 \):
  \[
  3n^2 = 12296 - 8
  \]
  \[
  3n^2 = 12288
  \]
  \[
  n^2 = \frac{12288}{3}
  \]
  \[
  n^2 = 4096
  \]
  Taking the square root of both sides:
  \[
  n = \sqrt{4096}
  \]
  \[
  n = 64
  \]
  Now, we calculate the product of the three numbers:
  \[
  (n-2) \cdot n \cdot (n+2) = (64-2) \cdot 64 \cdot (64+2) = 62 \cdot 64 \cdot 66
  \]
  We need to find the product divided by 8:
  \[
  \frac{62 \cdot 64 \cdot 66}{8}
  \]
  Simplifying the fraction:
  \[
  \frac{62 \cdot 64 \cdot 66}{8} = \frac{62 \cdot 64 \cdot 66}{2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2} = \frac{62 \cdot 64 \cdot 66}{8}
  \]
  Calculating the product:
  \[
  62 \cdot 64 = 3968
  \]
  \[
  3968 \cdot 66 = 264992
  \]
  Dividing by 8:
  \[
  \frac{264992}{8} = 33124
  \]
  Thus, the product of the three numbers divided by 8 is 32736.
