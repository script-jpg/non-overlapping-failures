  Given that the sum of the squares of three consecutive positive even numbers is 12296, we need to find the product of these three numbers divided by 8, which should show that it is 32736.
  1. Let the three consecutive even numbers be \( n-2 \), \( n \), and \( n+2 \).
  2. The sum of their squares is given by:
     \[
     (n-2)^2 + n^2 + (n+2)^2 = 12296
     \]
  3. Expanding and simplifying the equation:
     \[
     (n^2 - 4n + 4) + n^2 + (n^2 + 4n + 4) = 12296
     \]
     \[
     3n^2 + 8 = 12296
     \]
     \[
     3n^2 = 12288
     \]
     \[
     n^2 = 4096
     \]
     \[
     n = 64 \quad \text{(since \( n \) is even)}
     \]
  4. The product of the three numbers is:
     \[
     (n-2) \cdot n \cdot (n+2) = (62) \cdot (64) \cdot (66)
     \]
  5. Dividing this product by 8:
     \[
     \frac{(62) \cdot (64) \cdot (66)}{8} = 32736
     \]
