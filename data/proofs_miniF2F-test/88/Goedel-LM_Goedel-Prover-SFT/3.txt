  Given three consecutive positive even numbers \( n-2 \), \( n \), and \( n+2 \), we know that the sum of their squares is 12296. We need to find the product of these numbers divided by 8, which should equal 32736.
  First, we simplify the given equation \( (n-2)^2 + n^2 + (n+2)^2 = 12296 \). Expanding each term, we get:
  \[ (n-2)^2 = n^2 - 4n + 4 \]
  \[ n^2 = n^2 \]
  \[ (n+2)^2 = n^2 + 4n + 4 \]
  Adding these together, we obtain:
  \[ n^2 - 4n + 4 + n^2 + n^2 + 4n + 4 = 12296 \]
  \[ 3n^2 + 8 = 12296 \]
  Solving for \( n^2 \):
  \[ 3n^2 = 12296 - 8 \]
  \[ 3n^2 = 12288 \]
  \[ n^2 = \frac{12288}{3} \]
  \[ n^2 = 4096 \]
  Since \( n \) is even, we find \( n = 64 \) (since \( 64^2 = 4096 \)).
  Next, we substitute \( n = 64 \) into the expression \( (n-2) \cdot n \cdot (n+2) / 8 \):
  \[ (64-2) = 62 \]
  \[ 62 \cdot 64 = 3936 \]
  \[ 3936 \cdot (64 + 2) = 3936 \cdot 66 \]
  \[ 3936 \cdot 66 = 262479 \]
  \[ \frac{262479}{8} = 32736 \]
  Thus, the product of the three numbers divided by 8 is indeed 32736.
