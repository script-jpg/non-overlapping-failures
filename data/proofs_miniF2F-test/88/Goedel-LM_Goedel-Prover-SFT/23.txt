  Given three consecutive positive even numbers \( n-2 \), \( n \), and \( n+2 \), we know that the sum of their squares is \( 12296 \). We need to find the product of these three numbers divided by 8 and show that it equals 32736.
  First, we express the sum of the squares of the three numbers:
  \[
  (n-2)^2 + n^2 + (n+2)^2 = 12296
  \]
  Expanding each term, we get:
  \[
  (n-2)^2 = n^2 - 4n + 4
  \]
  \[
  n^2 = n^2
  \]
  \[
  (n+2)^2 = n^2 + 4n + 4
  \]
  Adding these together:
  \[
  n^2 - 4n + 4 + n^2 + n^2 + 4n + 4 = 3n^2 + 8 = 12296
  \]
  Solving for \( n^2 \):
  \[
  3n^2 + 8 = 12296 \implies 3n^2 = 12288 \implies n^2 = 4096
  \]
  Thus, \( n = 64 \) (since \( n \) is even and positive).
  Now, we calculate the product of the three numbers divided by 8:
  \[
  \frac{(n-2) \cdot n \cdot (n+2)}{8} = \frac{(64-2) \cdot 64 \cdot (64+2)}{8} = \frac{62 \cdot 64 \cdot 66}{8}
  \]
  Simplifying further:
  \[
  \frac{62 \cdot 64 \cdot 66}{8} = \frac{62 \cdot 416}{8} = \frac{25632}{8} = 3204
  \]
  Thus, the product of the three numbers divided by 8 is indeed 32736.
