  Given three consecutive positive even numbers \( n-2 \), \( n \), and \( n+2 \), we know that the sum of their squares is 12296. We need to find the product of these three numbers divided by 8, which is 32736.
  First, we express the sum of the squares:
  \[
  (n-2)^2 + n^2 + (n+2)^2 = 12296
  \]
  Expanding each term:
  \[
  (n-2)^2 = n^2 - 4n + 4
  \]
  \[
  (n+2)^2 = n^2 + 4n + 4
  \]
  Adding these together:
  \[
  n^2 - 4n + 4 + n^2 + n^2 + 4n + 4 = 12296
  \]
  Combining like terms:
  \[
  3n^2 + 8 = 12296
  \]
  Solving for \( n^2 \):
  \[
  3n^2 = 12296 - 8
  \]
  \[
  3n^2 = 12288
  \]
  \[
  n^2 = \frac{12288}{3}
  \]
  \[
  n^2 = 4096
  \]
  Since \( n \) is even, we find \( n = 64 \).
  Next, we calculate the product of the three numbers:
  \[
  (64-2) \cdot 64 \cdot (64+2) = 62 \cdot 64 \cdot 66
  \]
  We divide this product by 8:
  \[
  \frac{62 \cdot 64 \cdot 66}{8} = 32736
  \]
  Thus, the product divided by 8 is indeed 32736.
