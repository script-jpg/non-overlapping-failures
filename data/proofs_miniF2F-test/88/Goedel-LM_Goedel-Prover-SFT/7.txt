  Given three consecutive positive even numbers \( n-2 \), \( n \), and \( n+2 \), we know that their sum of squares is 12296. We need to find the product of these three numbers divided by 8, and show that it equals 32736.
  1. Start by simplifying the given equation \( (n-2)^2 + n^2 + (n+2)^2 = 12296 \).
  2. Expand and combine like terms to form a single equation in terms of \( n \).
  3. Solve the resulting quadratic equation to find the value of \( n \).
  4. Substitute the value of \( n \) into the expression for the product of the three numbers divided by 8.
  5. Verify that the result matches the given value of 32736.
