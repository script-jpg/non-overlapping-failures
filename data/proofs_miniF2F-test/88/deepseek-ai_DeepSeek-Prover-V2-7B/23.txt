    Given the equation:
    \[
    (n - 2)^2 + n^2 + (n + 2)^2 = 12296
    \]
    Expanding and simplifying the left-hand side:
    \[
    (n - 2)^2 = n^2 - 4n + 4
    \]
    \[
    (n + 2)^2 = n^2 + 4n + 4
    \]
    Adding these together:
    \[
    n^2 - 4n + 4 + n^2 + n^2 + 4n + 4 = 3n^2 + 8 = 12296
    \]
    Subtracting 8 from both sides:
    \[
    3n^2 = 12288
    \]
    Dividing by 3:
    \[
    n^2 = 4096
    \]
    Taking the square root of both sides:
    \[
    n = \sqrt{4096} = 64
    \]
    Since \( n \) must be even, the next consecutive even number is \( n + 2 = 66 \) and the previous one is \( n - 2 = 62 \).
    Thus, the three consecutive even numbers are 62, 64, and 66.
