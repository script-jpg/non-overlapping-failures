-- First, we notice that 2005 = 5x401, where 5 and 401 are both prime numbers.

  have : Nat.Prime 401 := by norm_num

  -- From this, the possible factor pairs of 2005 are:
  -- 2005 = 1 x 2005, 5 x 401, 401 x 5, or 2005 x 1.
  -- But since neither m nor n is 1, the only possible factorization is 5 x 401.

    have h' : m ≤ 2005 := by gcongr

    -- For m = 5 and m = 401, we can determine the corresponding values of n.

    -- Then we show that the sum of the two numbers is 406.

  -- Thus we have the answer.
