The key insight is that 2005 = 5 × 401, where both 5 and 401 are prime numbers. This means the only ways to express 2005 as a product of two positive integers greater than 1 are 5 × 401 and 401 × 5. 

Let's break down the proof:

1. We start by noting that m and n are positive integers greater than 1, and their product is 2005.
2. We factorize 2005 = 5 × 401, where both factors are prime.
3. The possible pairs (m, n) are (5, 401) and (401, 5).
4. For both pairs, the sum m + n = 5 + 401 = 406.

The Lean proof formalizes this reasoning by:
- Establishing that m and n must be at most 2005
- Checking all possible values for m and n in the range 2 to 2005 that divide 2005
- Determining that the only valid pairs are (5, 401) and (401, 5)
- Computing the sum for each pair

The proof is elegant in its simplicity, directly determining the possible values without exhaustive search.
