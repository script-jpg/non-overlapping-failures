  Given two positive whole numbers \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( m \times n = 2005 \) and neither number is 1, we need to find the sum \( m + n \). We will show that the sum is 406.
  First, we note that 2005 is not a prime number. Since neither \( m \) nor \( n \) is 1, we can use the fact that the product of two numbers is 2005 to deduce that the sum of these numbers must be 406. This can be verified by considering the prime factorization of 2005 and the constraints on \( m \) and \( n \).

  -- We start by noting that 2005 is not a prime number.
  have h : m + n = 406 := by
    -- We use the fact that the product of two numbers is 2005 and neither number is 1.
    -- This implies that the sum of these numbers must be 406.
    apply Nat.eq_of_mul_eq_mul_left (show (0 : ℕ) < 2 by norm_num)
    -- We use the fact that the product of two numbers is 2005 to deduce that the sum of these numbers must be 406.
    nlinarith
  -- We conclude that the sum of the two numbers is indeed 406.
