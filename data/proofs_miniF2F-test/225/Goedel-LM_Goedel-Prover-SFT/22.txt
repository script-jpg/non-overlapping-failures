  Given two positive whole numbers \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( m \times n = 2005 \) and neither \( m \) nor \( n \) is 1, we need to find the sum \( m + n \). We will show that the sum is 406.
  First, we note that 2005 is a product of two numbers greater than 1. We can factorize 2005 as \( 5 \times 401 \). Since neither factor is 1, we must have \( m = 5 \) and \( n = 401 \) (or vice versa).
  To verify the sum, we calculate \( m + n \):
  \[ m + n = 5 + 401 = 406 \]
  Thus, the sum of the two numbers is indeed 406.
