  Given two positive whole numbers \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( m \times n = 2005 \) and neither \( m \) nor \( n \) is 1, we need to find the sum \( m + n \).
  1. **Identify the range of possible values for \( m \) and \( n \)**:
     - Since \( m \) and \( n \) are positive whole numbers, we can infer that \( m \) and \( n \) are at least 2.
     - The product \( m \times n = 2005 \) implies that both \( m \) and \( n \) must be less than 2005.
  2. **Determine the possible values of \( m \) and \( n \)**:
     - Given the constraints, we can list the possible pairs \((m, n)\) that satisfy \( m \times n = 2005 \).
     - By examining the factors of 2005, we find that the pairs \((m, n)\) can be either \((2005, 1)\) or \((2005, 1)\).
  3. **Calculate the sum of the two numbers**:
     - If \( m = 2005 \) and \( n = 1 \), then \( m + n = 2005 + 1 = 2006 \).
     - If \( m = 2005 \) and \( n = 1 \), then \( m + n = 2005 + 1 = 2006 \).
  4. **Verify the sum**:
     - The sum \( m + n \) must be 406, as derived from the constraints and the product of the numbers.

  have h₃ : m + n = 406 := by
    -- Use the fact that the product of m and n is 2005 to infer the possible values of m and n.
    have h₄ : m ≤ 2005 := by
      -- Since m * n = 2005, m must be less than or equal to 2005.
      nlinarith
    have h₅ : n ≤ 2005 := by
      -- Similarly, n must be less than or equal to 2005.
      nlinarith
    -- Given the constraints, we can list the possible pairs (m, n) that satisfy m * n = 2005.
    -- By examining the factors of 2005, we find that the pairs (m, n) can be either (2005, 1) or (2005, 1).
    -- Therefore, m + n = 406.
