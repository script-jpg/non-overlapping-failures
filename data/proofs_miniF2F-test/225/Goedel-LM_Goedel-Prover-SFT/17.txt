  Given two positive whole numbers \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( m \times n = 2005 \) and neither \( m \) nor \( n \) is 1, we need to show that their sum \( m + n \) is 406. We will consider the possible values of \( m \) and \( n \) that satisfy the given conditions and verify the sum.

  -- We will consider the possible values of m and n that satisfy the given conditions and verify the sum.
  have : m + n = 406 := by
    -- We consider the possible values of m and n that are greater than 1 and whose product is 2005.
    have : m ≤ 2005 := by
      -- Since m * n = 2005, m must be less than or equal to 2005.
      nlinarith
    have : n ≤ 2005 := by
      -- Similarly, n must be less than or equal to 2005.
      nlinarith
    -- We use interval_cases to consider specific values of m and n that satisfy the conditions.
    interval_cases m <;> interval_cases n <;> omega
  -- Finally, we conclude that m + n = 406.
