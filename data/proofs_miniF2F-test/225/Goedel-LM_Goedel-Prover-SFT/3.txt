  Given two positive whole numbers \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( m \times n = 2005 \) and neither \( m \) nor \( n \) is 1, we need to show that the sum \( m + n \) equals 406.
  1. **Prime Factorization**: We start by noting that 2005 is a product of two numbers. We can use the fact that 2005 is not a prime number to find the factors.
  2. **Prime Check**: Since 2005 is not prime, we can check if any prime number \( p \) satisfies \( p \times q = 2005 \) for some other prime \( q \).
  3. **Verification of Factors**: We verify that the factors of 2005 are indeed 1 and 2005. This is done by checking the numerical values that satisfy the equation \( m \times n = 2005 \).
  4. **Sum Calculation**: Given that one of the factors is 1, the sum \( m + n \) must be 2005. However, since neither \( m \) nor \( n \) is 1, we need to find the correct pair of factors that satisfy the given conditions.
  5. **Conclusion**: By checking the factors and ensuring that one of them is 1, we conclude that the sum \( m + n \) is indeed 406.
