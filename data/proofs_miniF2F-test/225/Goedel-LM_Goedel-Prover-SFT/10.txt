  Given two positive whole numbers \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( m \times n = 2005 \), we need to show that if neither \( m \) nor \( n \) is 1, the sum of the two numbers is 406.
  1. Since \( m \times n = 2005 \), we know that both \( m \) and \( n \) must be greater than 1.
  2. We are given that \( m \times n = 2005 \).
  3. To find the sum \( m + n \), we can use the fact that \( m \) and \( n \) are factors of 2005.
  4. The prime factorization of 2005 is \( 5 \times 401 \).
  5. Therefore, \( m \) and \( n \) must be either 5 and 401, or 401 and 5.
  6. Since \( m \) and \( n \) are positive and greater than 1, we can conclude that \( m + n = 406 \).

  have h₃ : m + n = 406 := by
    -- Since m and n are positive and their product is 2005, we can use the fact that the prime factorization of 2005 is 5 * 401.
    -- Therefore, m and n must be either 5 and 401, or 401 and 5.
    -- Given that m and n are positive and greater than 1, we can conclude that m + n = 406.
    have h₃ : m ≤ 2005 := by nlinarith
    have h₄ : n ≤ 2005 := by nlinarith
    -- Using interval_cases to check all possible values of m and n that satisfy the product condition.
    interval_cases m <;> interval_cases n <;> norm_num at h₂ <;> omega
  -- The result follows directly from the above reasoning.
