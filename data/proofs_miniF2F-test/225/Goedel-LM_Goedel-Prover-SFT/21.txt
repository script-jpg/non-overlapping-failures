  Given two positive whole numbers \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( m \times n = 2005 \), and knowing that neither \( m \) nor \( n \) is 1, we need to show that their sum \( m + n \) equals 406. We will consider the possible values of \( m \) and \( n \) that satisfy the given conditions and verify the sum.

  have h₀ : m ≤ 2005 := by
    -- Since m is a positive whole number and m * n = 2005, we know m > 0.
    -- To ensure m is less than or equal to 2005, we use the fact that m * n = 2005 and n > 0.

  have h₁ : n ≤ 2005 := by
    -- Similarly, n is a positive whole number and m * n = 2005, so n > 0.
    -- To ensure n is less than or equal to 2005, we use the fact that m * n = 2005 and m > 0.
