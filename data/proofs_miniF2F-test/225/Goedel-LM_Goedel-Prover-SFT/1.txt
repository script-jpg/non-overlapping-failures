  Given two positive whole numbers \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( m \times n = 2005 \), and assuming neither \( m \) nor \( n \) is 1, we need to find the sum \( m + n \). We are to show that this sum is 406.
  1. Since \( m \) and \( n \) are positive integers and their product is 2005, we can list the pairs \((m, n)\) that satisfy \( m \times n = 2005 \).
  2. From the list, we find that the pairs are \((1, 2005)\), \((5, 401)\), \((401, 5)\), \((2005, 1)\), \((2005, 1)\), \((401, 5)\), \((5, 401)\), and \((1, 2005)\).
  3. However, since neither \( m \) nor \( n \) is 1, we discard the pairs \((1, 2005)\) and \((2005, 1)\).
  4. The remaining pairs are \((5, 401)\), \((401, 5)\), \((2005, 1)\), and \((1, 2005)\).
  5. From these pairs, we see that the only pair that results in the sum \( m + n = 406 \) is \((401, 5)\).
  6. Therefore, the sum \( m + n \) is indeed 406.
