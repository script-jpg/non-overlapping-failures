  Given two positive whole numbers \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( m \times n = 2005 \), we need to find the sum \( m + n \). Since neither \( m \) nor \( n \) is 1, we can use the fact that the product of two numbers is 2005 to deduce that \( m \) and \( n \) must be 13 and 157, or 157 and 13. This is because the only factors of 2005 that are greater than 1 are 13 and 157. Therefore, the sum of \( m \) and \( n \) is \( 13 + 157 = 170 \). However, this contradicts the given condition that the sum should be 406. Therefore, we must have made an error in our initial assumptions or calculations.
