  Given two positive whole numbers \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( m \times n = 2005 \), and neither \( m \) nor \( n \) is 1, we need to find the sum \( m + n \). We will show that the sum is 406.
  First, we note that 2005 is not a prime number, and since neither \( m \) nor \( n \) is 1, we can use the properties of multiplication and the fact that 2005 is not prime to deduce that \( m \) and \( n \) must be factors of 2005.
  Next, we observe that the factors of 2005 can be enumerated by considering the prime factorization of 2005 and then counting the combinations of its prime factors. The prime factorization of 2005 is \( 5 \times 13 \times 31 \). The number of factors of 2005 is given by the product of one plus each of the exponents in its prime factorization:
  \[
  (1 + 1) \times (1 + 1) \times (1 + 1) = 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8
  \]
  Since 2005 is not a prime number, we need to consider the factors of 2005 that are greater than 1. The factors of 2005 that are greater than 1 are \( 5, 13, 31, 5 \times 13, 5 \times 31, 13 \times 31, 5 \times 13 \times 31 \).
  To find the sum \( m + n \), we need to choose two factors from these that multiply to 2005. The pairs of factors that multiply to 2005 are:
  \[
  (5, 401), (13, 154), (31, 64)
  \]
  Among these pairs, the pair \( (5, 401) \) is the only pair where both factors are greater than 1. Therefore, the sum \( m + n \) is:
  \[
  5 + 401 = 406
  \]
