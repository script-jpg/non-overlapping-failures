  Given two positive whole numbers \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( m \times n = 2005 \) and neither \( m \) nor \( n \) is 1, we need to show that the sum \( m + n \) equals 406.
  First, we note that 2005 is a product of two numbers greater than 1. We can list the factors of 2005 and check which pairs satisfy the condition \( m + n = 406 \).
  1. The prime factorization of 2005 is \( 2005 = 5 \times 13 \times 31 \).
  2. We consider the pairs of factors \( (m, n) \) such that \( m \times n = 2005 \).
  3. We filter out the pairs where \( m \) or \( n \) is 1, which would not satisfy \( m > 1 \) and \( n > 1 \).
  4. We then check the remaining pairs to see if \( m + n = 406 \).
