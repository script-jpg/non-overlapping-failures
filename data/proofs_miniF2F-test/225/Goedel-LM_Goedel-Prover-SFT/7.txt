  Given two positive whole numbers \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( m \times n = 2005 \), we need to show that the sum \( m + n \) is 406. We will consider the possible values of \( m \) and \( n \) that satisfy the product condition and verify the sum.

  have : m + n = 406 := by
    -- We use the fact that m and n are positive and their product is 2005.
    have : m ≤ 406 := by
      -- Since m is a positive number and m * n = 2005, we can use the fact that n is positive to bound m.
      nlinarith
    have : n ≤ 406 := by
      -- Similarly, since n is a positive number and m * n = 2005, we can use the fact that m is positive to bound n.
      nlinarith
    -- We now use interval_cases to consider the possible values of m and n within the bounds.
    interval_cases m <;> interval_cases n <;> norm_num at h₂ ⊢
    -- By checking each pair (m, n) that satisfies m * n = 2005, we find that the sum m + n is indeed 406.
