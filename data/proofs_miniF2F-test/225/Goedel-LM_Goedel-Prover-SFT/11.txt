  Given two positive whole numbers \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( m \times n = 2005 \) and neither number is 1, we need to find the sum \( m + n \). We will show that the sum is 406.
  1. Since \( m \) and \( n \) are positive and their product is 2005, we can deduce that neither \( m \) nor \( n \) can be 1 (as 1 is not a positive whole number).
  2. We start by assuming \( m \) and \( n \) are both greater than 1.
  3. We use the fact that the product \( m \times n = 2005 \) and the constraints on \( m \) and \( n \) to find the possible values of \( m \) and \( n \).
  4. By examining the factors of 2005, we find that the only pair of positive integers greater than 1 that multiply to 2005 are 401 and 5.
  5. Therefore, the sum \( m + n \) is \( 401 + 5 = 406 \).
