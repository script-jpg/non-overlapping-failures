  Given two positive whole numbers \( m \) and \( n \), we know that their product is 2005. We are also given that neither \( m \) nor \( n \) is 1. We need to show that the sum of \( m \) and \( n \) is 406.
  1. Since \( m \) and \( n \) are both greater than 1, we can use the fact that the product \( m \times n = 2005 \) to find specific values for \( m \) and \( n \).
  2. We can solve the equation \( m \times n = 2005 \) by considering the factors of 2005. The prime factorization of 2005 is \( 2005 = 5 \times 401 \).
  3. Given that \( m \) and \( n \) are both greater than 1, the only possible pairs \((m, n)\) that satisfy the product are \((5, 401)\) and \((401, 5)\).
  4. We then check the sum of these pairs: \( 5 + 401 = 406 \).
  Thus, the sum of \( m \) and \( n \) is indeed 406.

  have h₃ : m * n = 2005 := h₂
  -- We can use the fact that the product of m and n is 2005 to find specific values for m and n.
  -- Since m and n are both greater than 1, the only possible pairs (m, n) that satisfy the product are (5, 401) and (401, 5).
  -- We then check the sum of these pairs: 5 + 401 = 406.
  have h₄ : m + n = 406 := by
    -- We use the fact that the product of m and n is 2005 to find specific values for m and n.
    -- By solving the equation m * n = 2005, we find that m and n must be 5 and 401 respectively.
    -- We then check the sum of these pairs: 5 + 401 = 406.
