  Given two positive whole numbers \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( m \times n = 2005 \), and neither number is 1, we need to show that the sum of the two numbers is 406.
  1. Since \( m \) and \( n \) are positive integers and their product is 2005, we can list the factors of 2005 and check the pairs that satisfy the product condition.
  2. The factors of 2005 are \( 1, 5, 13, 31, 59, 103, 161, 2005 \).
  3. We need to find pairs \((m, n)\) such that \( m \times n = 2005 \).
  4. The pairs are \((5, 401)\), \((13, 155)\), \((31, 65)\), \((59, 34)\), \((103, 19)\), \((161, 13)\), \((2005, 1)\).
  5. Among these pairs, the only pair that satisfies \( m > 1 \) and \( n > 1 \) is \((103, 19)\).
  6. Therefore, \( m + n = 103 + 19 = 122 \).

  have h₃ : m + n = 406 := by
    -- We use the fact that the sum of m and n is 406.
    have : m + n = 406 := by
      -- We use the fact that the product of m and n is 2005.
      have : m * n = 2005 := by simpa using h₂
      -- We solve the equation m + n = 406 using the constraints and the product equation.
      have : m ≤ 406 := by nlinarith
      have : n ≤ 406 := by nlinarith
      -- We use interval_cases to check all possible values of m and n.
