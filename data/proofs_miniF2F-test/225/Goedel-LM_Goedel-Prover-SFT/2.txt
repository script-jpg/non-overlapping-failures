  Given two positive whole numbers \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( m \times n = 2005 \), and neither \( m \) nor \( n \) is 1, we need to show that the sum \( m + n \) is 406.
  1. **Establish the positivity of \( m \) and \( n \):**
     - Since \( m \) is a positive whole number, \( m > 0 \).
     - Similarly, \( n \) is a positive whole number, \( n > 0 \).
  2. **Verify the product and sum:**
     - The product of \( m \) and \( n \) is given by \( m \times n = 2005 \).
     - We need to find \( m + n \).
  3. **Check the possible values of \( m \) and \( n \):**
     - Given \( m > 1 \) and \( n > 1 \), we need to find pairs \((m, n)\) such that \( m \times n = 2005 \).
  4. **Solve for \( m \) and \( n \):**
     - By inspection or solving the equation \( m \times n = 2005 \), we find that \( m = 41 \) and \( n = 49 \) satisfy the condition.
  5. **Calculate the sum:**
     - The sum of \( m \) and \( n \) is \( m + n = 41 + 49 = 90 \).
  6. **Verify the sum:**
     - The sum \( 90 \) does not match the required sum of 406. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the conditions and the possible values of \( m \) and \( n \).
