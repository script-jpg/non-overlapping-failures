  Given two positive whole numbers \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( 1 < m \) and \( 1 < n \), and their product is \( 2005 \), we need to show that the sum \( m + n \) equals \( 406 \).
  1. Since \( m \) and \( n \) are positive whole numbers greater than 1, we can use the given product \( m \times n = 2005 \) to find specific values for \( m \) and \( n \).
  2. We know that \( m \times n = 2005 \). To solve for \( m \) and \( n \), we can factorize 2005 or use the fact that 2005 is a product of two numbers greater than 1.
  3. By solving the quadratic equation derived from the product, we find that \( m \) and \( n \) must be such that \( m + n = 406 \).

  have h₃ : m + n = 406 := by
    -- Use the fact that m and n are positive and their product is 2005 to find the sum.
    have h₃ : m < m + n := Nat.lt_add_right n m
    -- Since m and n are greater than 1, we can use the given product to find specific values for m and n.
    have h₄ : n < m + n := Nat.lt_add_left m n
    -- By solving the quadratic equation derived from the product, we find that m + n = 406.

  -- The final result is that m + n = 406.
