  Given two positive whole numbers \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( m \times n = 2005 \), we need to find the sum \( m + n \). We are provided with the conditions \( 1 < m \) and \( 1 < n \). We will show that the sum \( m + n \) equals 406.
  First, we note that 2005 is not a prime number, so it cannot be expressed as the product of two integers. However, since \( m \) and \( n \) are both greater than 1, we can use the fact that the product of two integers equals 2005 to deduce that the sum of these integers must be 406. This can be verified by considering the factors of 2005 and their sums.

  have : m + n = 406 := by
    -- We use the fact that the product of m and n is 2005 to find the sum.
    have h₃ : m ≤ 2005 := by
      -- Since m * n = 2005, m must be less than or equal to 2005.
      nlinarith
    have h₄ : n ≤ 2005 := by
      -- Similarly, n must be less than or equal to 2005.
      nlinarith
    -- We now use interval_cases to consider possible values of m and n.
    interval_cases m <;> interval_cases n <;> norm_num at h₂ ⊢
  -- Finally, we conclude that m + n = 406.
