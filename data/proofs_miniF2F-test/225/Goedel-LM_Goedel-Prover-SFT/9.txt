  Given two positive whole numbers \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( m \times n = 2005 \), and neither \( m \) nor \( n \) is 1, we need to show that \( m + n = 406 \).
  First, we establish that both \( m \) and \( n \) are greater than 1. Then, we use the fact that the product of \( m \) and \( n \) is 2005 to find the possible values of \( m \) and \( n \). By examining the factors of 2005, we can determine that \( m \) and \( n \) must be 41 and 49 respectively. Finally, we sum these values to confirm that \( m + n = 406 \).

  -- Finally, sum these values to confirm that m + n = 406.
  have h₅ : m + n = 406 := by
    -- Use the fact that m and n are factors of 2005 and greater than 1 to find the exact values.
    have h₆ : m ≤ 2005 := by nlinarith
    have h₇ : n ≤ 2005 := by nlinarith
    -- Use interval_cases to check all possible values of m and n that satisfy the conditions.
    interval_cases m <;> interval_cases n <;> simp_all
  -- The exact sum of m and n is 406, as derived from the factors of 2005.
