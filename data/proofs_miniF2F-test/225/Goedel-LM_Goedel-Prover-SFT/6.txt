  Given two positive whole numbers \( m \) and \( n \) such that \( m \times n = 2005 \) and neither \( m \) nor \( n \) is 1, we need to show that the sum \( m + n \) equals 406. We will consider the possible values of \( m \) and \( n \) that satisfy the given conditions and verify the sum.

  -- We know that m and n are positive whole numbers greater than 1.
  have h₃ : 1 < m := h₀
  have h₄ : 1 < n := h₁
  -- We need to find pairs (m, n) such that m * n = 2005 and m + n = 406.
  have h₅ : m + n = 406 := by
    -- We use the fact that m and n are positive and their product is 2005.
    have h₆ : m ≤ 2005 := by
      -- Since m * n = 2005, m must be less than or equal to 2005.

    have h₇ : n ≤ 2005 := by
      -- Similarly, n must be less than or equal to 2005.
      nlinarith
    -- We use interval_cases to check possible values of m and n.
    interval_cases m <;> interval_cases n <;> simp_all
  -- The sum m + n is indeed 406.
