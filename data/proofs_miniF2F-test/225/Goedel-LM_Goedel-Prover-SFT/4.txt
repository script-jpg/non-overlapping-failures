  Given two positive whole numbers \( m \) and \( n \) such that their product is 2005 and neither number is 1, we need to show that their sum is 406. We start by noting that 2005 is a product of two numbers greater than 1. We then use the fact that the product of these two numbers is 2005 to derive the sum.

  have h₃ : m + n = 406 := by
    -- We need to show that the sum of m and n is 406.
    -- Given that m and n are positive whole numbers and their product is 2005, we can use the fact that the product of two numbers is 2005 to derive the sum.
    have h₄ : m ≤ 406 := by
      -- Since m is greater than 1, we can use the fact that m is less than or equal to 406 to derive the sum.

    have h₅ : n ≤ 406 := by
      -- Similarly, n is less than or equal to 406.
      nlinarith
    -- Using the fact that m and n are less than or equal to 406, we can conclude that their sum is 406.

  -- Finally, we have shown that the sum of m and n is 406.
