The ones digit of a number is its remainder when divided by 10. To find the ones digit of the product $1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 9 \cdot 11 \cdot 13$, we need to compute this product modulo 10.

Let's compute step by step:
- $1 \equiv 1 \pmod{10}$
- $3 \equiv 3 \pmod{10}$
- $5 \equiv 5 \pmod{10}$
- $7 \equiv 7 \pmod{10}$
- $9 \equiv 9 \pmod{10}$
- $11 \equiv 1 \pmod{10}$
- $13 \equiv 3 \pmod{10}$

So we have $1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 9 \cdot 1 \cdot 3 \equiv 1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 9 \cdot 3 \pmod{10}$

Continuing:
$1 \cdot 3 = 3$
$3 \cdot 5 = 15 \equiv 5 \pmod{10}$
$5 \cdot 7 = 35 \equiv 5 \pmod{10}$
$5 \cdot 9 = 45 \equiv 5 \pmod{10}$
$5 \cdot 3 = 15 \equiv 5 \pmod{10}$

Therefore, the ones digit of the product is 5.

In Lean 4, we can prove this directly using `norm_num`, which is a tactic that computes numerical expressions:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

We import the necessary libraries and open namespaces for working with numbers and basic arithmetic.

Now, we'll define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_299 : 1 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 9 * 11 * 13 % 10 = 5 := by
```

We have our theorem statement: we need to prove that the remainder when dividing the product by 10 equals 5. 

To complete the proof, we simply need to compute the product modulo 10. Lean's `norm_num` tactic can handle this calculation automatically:

```tactics
norm_num
```

The `norm_num` tactic will compute the value of the arithmetic expression and verify that it indeed equals 5. It will calculate:
1. Compute the product: $1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 9 \cdot 11 \cdot 13 = 15015$
2. Compute $15015 \bmod 10 = 5$

So the complete proof is simply:
- Set up the theorem with the appropriate statement
- Use `norm_num` to compute the numerical expression

This is a straightforward problem where the answer is clearly 5 because the product includes the number 5, and the presence of 5 as a factor means that the product is divisible by 5 but not by 10 (since there's no additional factor of 2). Therefore, the ones digit is 5.
