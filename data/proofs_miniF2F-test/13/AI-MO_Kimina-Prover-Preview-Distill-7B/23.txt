  -- Since the remainder when divided by 5 is 0, the ones digit must be either 0 or 5.
  -- To determine which, consider the remainder when divided by 2.

  -- Because the product is odd, the ones digit must be odd.
  -- The only odd digit that is a multiple of 5 is 5.
  -- Therefore, the ones digit of the product must be 5.
