-- Show that the product $1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 9 \cdot 11 \cdot 13$ has a ones digit of 5 by computing the remainder when divided by 10.

This Lean 4 proof is remarkably concise because Lean's computational engine can directly evaluate the arithmetic expression. The `norm_num` tactic is powerful enough to compute the exact value of the product and then calculate the remainder when divided by 10. 

Let's compute this manually to verify:
- $1 \cdot 3 = 3$
- $3 \cdot 5 = 15$ (ones digit is 5)
- $5 \cdot 7 = 35$ (ones digit is 5)
- $5 \cdot 9 = 45$ (ones digit is 5)
- $5 \cdot 11 = 55$ (ones digit is 5)
- $5 \cdot 13 = 65$ (ones digit is 5)

So indeed, the ones digit of the product is 5. The Lean proof confirms this calculation directly.

Therefore, the final answer is $\boxed{5}$.
