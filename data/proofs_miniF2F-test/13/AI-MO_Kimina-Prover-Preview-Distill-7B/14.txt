The key insight is that when multiplying numbers, the ones digit of the result is determined by the ones digits of the factors. In this case, we have the numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13. Their ones digits are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1, and 3, respectively.

Let's compute the product step by step, focusing only on the ones digit:

1. Start with 1 × 3 = 3 (ones digit is 3)
2. Multiply by 5: 3 × 5 = 15 (ones digit is 5)
3. Multiply by 7: 5 × 7 = 35 (ones digit is 5)
4. Multiply by 9: 5 × 9 = 45 (ones digit is 5)
5. Multiply by 1: 5 × 1 = 5 (ones digit is 5)
6. Multiply by 3: 5 × 3 = 15 (ones digit is 5)

So the ones digit of the product $1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 9 \cdot 11 \cdot 13$ is 5.

In Lean 4, we can prove this by simply computing the remainder when dividing by 10, which gives us the ones digit. The `norm_num` tactic is powerful enough to compute this arithmetic expression directly.

The complete formal proof is:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

```

Now we can state the theorem:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_299 : 1 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 9 * 11 * 13 % 10 = 5 := by
```

And Lean's `norm_num` tactic can compute this directly:

```tactics
norm_num
```

The `norm_num` tactic is computing the entire product and then taking the modulo 10, which gives us the ones digit. As we calculated manually, the result is indeed 5.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{5}$.
