-- The ones digit of a the product of a set of numbers is the product of the ones digits of those numbers, modulo 10.
  -- So, we need find the ones digit of 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 and 13, which are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 1 and 3, respectively.
  -- 1 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 9 * 1 * 3 = 945
  -- The ones digit of 945 is 5.
  -- Hence, the ones digit of 1 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 9 * 11 * 13 is 5.
