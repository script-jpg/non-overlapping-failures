The ones digit of a number is its remainder when divided by 10. To find the ones digit of the product $1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 9 \cdot 11 \cdot 13$, we need to compute this product modulo 10.

Let's compute the product step by step:

$1 \cdot 3 = 3$

$3 \cdot 5 = 15$

$15 \cdot 7 = 105$

$105 \cdot 9 = 945$

$945 \cdot 11 = 10395$

$10395 \cdot 13 = 135135$

Now, $135135 \bmod 10 = 5$, since the remainder when 135135 is divided by 10 is 5.

Therefore, the ones digit of $1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 9 \cdot 11 \cdot 13$ is 5.

In Lean, we can compute this directly using `norm_num`:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

We're importing the necessary libraries and setting up our environment. The `maxHeartbeats 0` option allows Lean to use as many computational steps as needed.

Now, let's define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_299 : 1 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 9 * 11 * 13 % 10 = 5 := by
```

We've declared our theorem. The goal is to prove that the remainder when $1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 9 \cdot 11 \cdot 13$ is divided by 10 is 5.

To prove this, we can compute the product and then take the remainder modulo 10:

```tactics
norm_num
```

The `norm_num` tactic is powerful enough to compute arithmetic goals involving concrete numbers. It will:
1. Compute the product $1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 9 \cdot 11 \cdot 13$
2. Compute the remainder when this product is divided by 10
3. Verify that this remainder equals 5

The `norm_num` tactic is able to handle this computational goal directly, proving our theorem without requiring further steps.

Therefore, the complete proof is:

1. The ones digit of $1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 9 \cdot 11 \cdot 13$ is the remainder when divided by 10
2. We compute the product to get 135135
3. $135135 \bmod 10 = 5$
4. Therefore, the ones digit is 5

The Lean proof is elegant in its simplicity, as the computational aspects of the problem can be directly handled by Lean's automation.
