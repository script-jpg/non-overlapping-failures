  To determine the ones digit of the product \(1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 9 \cdot 11 \cdot 13\), we need to compute the product modulo 10. We observe that the product of these numbers modulo 10 simplifies to 5. This can be verified by direct computation or by noting that the product of these numbers modulo 10 is equivalent to the product of their ones digits modulo 10.
