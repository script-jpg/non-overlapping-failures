  To determine the ones digit of the product \(1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 9 \cdot 11 \cdot 13\), we need to find the remainder when this product is divided by 10. We can simplify this by considering the ones digits of each factor and multiplying them together.
  1. The ones digit of 1 is 1.
  2. The ones digit of 3 is 3.
  3. The ones digit of 5 is 5.
  4. The ones digit of 7 is 7.
  5. The ones digit of 9 is 9.
  6. The ones digit of 11 is 1.
  7. The ones digit of 13 is 3.
  Multiplying these ones digits together:
  \[ 1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 9 \cdot 1 \cdot 3 = 5 \]
  Thus, the ones digit of the product \(1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 9 \cdot 11 \cdot 13\) is 5.

  -- The ones digit of 1 is 1, the ones digit of 3 is 3, the ones digit of 5 is 5, the ones digit of 7 is 7, the ones digit of 9 is 9, the ones digit of 11 is 1, the ones digit of 13 is 3.
  -- Multiplying these ones digits together: 1 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 9 * 1 * 3 = 5.
  -- Thus, the ones digit of the product is 5.
