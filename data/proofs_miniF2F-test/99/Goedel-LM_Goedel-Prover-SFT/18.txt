  Given the system of linear equations:
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  3x + 4y - 12z &= 10 \\
  -2x - 3y + 9z &= -4
  \end{align*}
  \]
  We need to compute the value of \( x \). By solving the system, we find that \( x = 14 \).
  -/
  -- We solve the system of linear equations to find the value of x.
  have : x = 14 := by
    -- Using linear algebra techniques, we solve the system.
    -- We use the `linarith` tactic to handle the linear equations.
    linarith
  -- We now have the value of x, which is 14.
