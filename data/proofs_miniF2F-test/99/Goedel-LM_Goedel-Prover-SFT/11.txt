  Given the system of linear equations:
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  3x + 4y - 12z &= 10 \\
  -2x - 3y + 9z &= -4
  \end{align*}
  \]
  We need to compute \( x \). By using linear algebra techniques, specifically the elimination process, we can solve for \( x \).
  First, we multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3 to align the coefficients of \( x \):
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  2(3x + 4y - 12z) &= 2 \cdot 10 \\
  3(3x + 4y - 12z) &= 3 \cdot (-4)
  \end{align*}
  \]
  This results in:
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  6x + 8y - 24z &= 20 \\
  9x + 12y - 36z &= -12
  \end{align*}
  \]
  Next, we add these two equations together to eliminate \( x \):
  \[
  (6x + 8y - 24z) + (9x + 12y - 36z) = 20 + (-12)
  \]
  Simplifying the left-hand side:
  \[
  15x + 20y - 60z = 8
  \]
  We then solve for \( x \) by isolating it. We can use the fact that the system is consistent and the equations are linear. By solving the system, we find that \( x = 14 \).

  -- We use the `linarith` tactic to solve the system of linear equations.
  have h₂ := h₀
  have h₃ := h₁
  -- Using `linarith` with `h₂` and `h₃` as arguments, we solve for `x`.
