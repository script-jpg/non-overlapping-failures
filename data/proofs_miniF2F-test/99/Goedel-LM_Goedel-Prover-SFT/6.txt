  Given the system of linear equations:
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  3x + 4y - 12z &= 10, \\
  -2x - 3y + 9z &= -4,
  \end{align*}
  \]
  we need to compute \( x \). By simplifying and solving the system of equations, we find that \( x = 14 \).

  -- The system of equations is now in a standard form.
  -- Use linear arithmetic to solve for x.
