  Given the system of linear equations:
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  3x + 4y - 12z &= 10, \\
  -2x - 3y + 9z &= -4,
  \end{align*}
  \]
  we need to compute the value of \( x \).
  First, we multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2 to align the coefficients of \( x \):
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  9x + 12y - 36z &= 30, \\
  -4x - 6y + 18z &= -8.
  \end{align*}
  \]
  Next, we add these two equations to eliminate \( x \):
  \[
  (9x + 12y - 36z) + (-4x - 6y + 18z) = 30 + (-8),
  \]
  \[
  5x + 6y - 18z = 22.
  \]
  We then multiply the first original equation by 4 and the second by 3 to align the coefficients of \( y \):
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  12x + 16y - 48z &= 40, \\
  -6x - 9y + 27z &= -12.
  \end{align*}
  \]
  Adding these two equations, we get:
  \[
  (12x + 16y - 48z) + (-6x - 9y + 27z) = 40 + (-12),
  \]
  \[
  6x + 7y - 21z = 28.
  \]
  Finally, we multiply the first original equation by 2 and the second by 1 to align the coefficients of \( z \):
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  6x + 8y - 24z &= 20, \\
  -2x - 3y + 9z &= -4.
  \end{align*}
  \]
  Adding these two equations, we get:
  \[
  (6x + 8y - 24z) + (-2x - 3y + 9z) = 20 + (-4),
  \]
  \[
  4x + 5y - 15z = 16.
  \]
  By solving the system of linear equations, we find that \( x = 14 \).
