  Given the system of linear equations:
  1. \(3x + 4y - 12z = 10\)
  2. \(-2x - 3y + 9z = -4\)
  We need to compute \(x\). By using the method of linear combinations, we can solve for \(x\) and \(y\) simultaneously.
  First, we multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3 to align the coefficients of \(x\):
  \[
  2(3x + 4y - 12z) = 2 \cdot 10 \implies 6x + 8y - 24z = 20
  \]
  \[
  3(-2x - 3y + 9z) = 3 \cdot (-4) \implies -6x - 9y + 27z = -12
  \]
  Next, we add these two new equations to eliminate \(x\):
  \[
  (6x + 8y - 24z) + (-6x - 9y + 27z) = 20 + (-12) \implies -y + 3z = 8
  \]
  We then isolate \(y\) and solve for \(z\):
  \[
  y = 3z - 8
  \]
  Substitute \(y = 3z - 8\) back into the first equation:
  \[
  3x + 4(3z - 8) - 12z = 10 \implies 3x + 12z - 32 - 12z = 10 \implies 3x - 32 = 10 \implies 3x = 42 \implies x = 14
  \]
  Thus, the value of \(x\) is \(14\).
