  Given the system of linear equations:
  1. \(3x + 4y - 12z = 10\)
  2. \(-2x - 3y + 9z = -4\)
  We need to compute \(x\). By solving the system step-by-step, we can derive the value of \(x\).
  First, we multiply the second equation by 2 to align the coefficients of \(x\):
  \[
  2(-2x - 3y + 9z) = 2(-4) \implies -4x - 6y + 18z = -8
  \]
  Next, we add this equation to the first equation:
  \[
  (3x + 4y - 12z) + (-4x - 6y + 18z) = 10 + (-8) \implies -x - 2y + 6z = 2
  \]
  We then multiply the second original equation by 3 to align the coefficients of \(y\):
  \[
  3(-2x - 3y + 9z) = 3(-4) \implies -6x - 9y + 27z = -12
  \]
  Next, we add this equation to the first equation:
  \[
  (3x + 4y - 12z) + (-6x - 9y + 27z) = 10 + (-12) \implies -3x - 5y + 15z = -2
  \]
  Finally, we solve the system of equations to find \(x\). By simplifying and solving the system, we find that \(x = 14\).
