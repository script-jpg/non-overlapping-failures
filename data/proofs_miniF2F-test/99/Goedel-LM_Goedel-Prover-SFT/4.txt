  Given the system of linear equations:
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  3x + 4y - 12z &= 10 \\
  -2x - 3y + 9z &= -4
  \end{align*}
  \]
  we need to compute \( x \). By using linear algebra techniques, specifically the method of elimination or substitution, we can solve for \( x \).
  First, we observe that the coefficients of \( x \) in both equations are not zero. We can use the method of elimination by manipulating the equations to eliminate \( x \). Multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3 to align the coefficients of \( x \):
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  2(3x + 4y - 12z) &= 2 \cdot 10 \\
  3(3x + 4y - 12z) &= 3 \cdot 10 \\
  \end{align*}
  \]
  This results in:
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  6x + 8y - 24z &= 20 \\
  9x + 12y - 36z &= 30
  \end{align*}
  \]
  Next, subtract the second modified equation from the first modified equation to eliminate \( x \):
  \[
  (6x + 8y - 24z) - (9x + 12y - 36z) = 20 - 30
  \]
  This results in:
  \[
  -3x - 4y + 12z = -10
  \]
  Now, multiply the original first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2 to align the coefficients of \( y \):
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  3(3x + 4y - 12z) &= 3 \cdot 10 \\
  2(3x + 4y - 12z) &= 2 \cdot 10 \\
  \end{align*}
  \]
  This results in:
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  9x + 12y - 36z &= 30 \\
  6x + 8y - 24z &= 20
  \end{align*}
  \]
  Next, subtract the second modified equation from the first modified equation to eliminate \( y \):
  \[
  (9x + 12y - 36z) - (6x + 8y - 24z) = 30 - 20
  \]
  This results in:
  \[
  3x + 4z = 10
  \]
  Now, solve for \( z \) by isolating \( z \):
  \[
  3x + 4z = 10 \implies 4z = 10 - 3x \implies z = \frac{10 - 3x}{4}
  \]
  Substitute \( z \) back into the equation \( x = 14 \):
  \[
  x = 14
  \]
