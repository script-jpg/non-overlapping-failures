  Given the system of linear equations:
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  3x + 4y - 12z &= 10, \\
  -2x - 3y + 9z &= -4,
  \end{align*}
  \]
  we need to compute \( x \).
  First, we normalize the equations by expanding and simplifying them. Then, we use linear algebra techniques to solve for \( x \). By manipulating the equations, we can isolate \( x \) and find its value.
