  Given the system of linear equations:
  1. \(3x + 4y - 12z = 10\)
  2. \(-2x - 3y + 9z = -4\)
  We need to compute \(x\). By using the `linarith` tactic, we can solve the system of equations directly and find that \(x = 14\).
  -/
  -- Use the `linarith` tactic to solve the system of linear equations.
  -- This tactic automatically handles linear arithmetic and will find the value of `x` that satisfies both equations.
  have h₂ : x = 14 := by linarith
  -- We have found that `x = 14`, which is the required result.
  exact h₂
