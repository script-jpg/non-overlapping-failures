  Given the system of linear equations:
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  3x + 4y - 12z &= 10 \\
  -2x - 3y + 9z &= -4
  \end{align*}
  \]
  We need to compute \( x \). By using linear algebra techniques, specifically the method of elimination, we can solve for \( x \).
  First, we will manipulate the equations to eliminate one of the variables. Multiply the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3 to align the coefficients of \( x \):
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  2(3x + 4y - 12z) &= 2 \cdot 10 \\
  3(3x + 4y - 12z) &= 3 \cdot 10
  \end{align*}
  \]
  This results in:
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  6x + 8y - 24z &= 20 \\
  9x + 12y - 36z &= 30
  \end{align*}
  \]
  Next, subtract the second equation from the first:
  \[
  (6x + 8y - 24z) - (9x + 12y - 36z) = 20 - 30
  \]
  Simplifying the left-hand side:
  \[
  6x + 8y - 24z - 9x - 12y + 36z = -10
  \]
  Combine like terms:
  \[
  -3x - 4y + 12z = -10
  \]
  Now, solve for \( x \) by isolating it:
  \[
  -3x = -10 + 4y - 12z
  \]
  \[
  x = \frac{10 - 4y + 12z}{3}
  \]
  To find \( y \) and \( z \), use the original equations. Multiply the first equation by 3 and the second by 2 to align the coefficients of \( y \):
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  3(3x + 4y - 12z) &= 3 \cdot 10 \\
  2(3x + 4y - 12z) &= 2 \cdot 10
  \end{align*}
  \]
  This results in:
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  9x + 12y - 36z &= 30 \\
  6x + 8y - 24z &= 20
  \end{align*}
  \]
  Subtract the second equation from the first:
  \[
  (9x + 12y - 36z) - (6x + 8y - 24z) = 30 - 20
  \]
  Simplifying the left-hand side:
  \[
  9x + 12y - 36z - 6x - 8y + 24z = 10
  \]
  Combine like terms:
  \[
  3x + 4y - 12z = 10
  \]
  Now, solve for \( y \) by isolating it:
  \[
  4y = 10 - 3x + 12z
  \]
  \[
  y = \frac{10 - 3x + 12z}{4}
  \]
  Finally, substitute the expressions for \( x \) and \( y \) back into the original equations to solve for \( z \). Once \( x \) and \( y \) are determined, solve for \( z \) and then substitute back to find \( x \).
