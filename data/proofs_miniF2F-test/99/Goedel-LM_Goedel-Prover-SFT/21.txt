  Given the system of linear equations:
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  3x + 4y - 12z &= 10, \\
  -2x - 3y + 9z &= -4,
  \end{align*}
  \]
  we need to compute \( x \) and show that it equals 14.
  First, we normalize the equations by expanding and simplifying them. Then, we use the `linarith` tactic to solve the system of linear equations.
