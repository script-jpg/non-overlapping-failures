Given the system of linear equations:

\[
\begin{align*}
3x + 4y - 12z &= 10 \\
-2x - 3y + 9z &= -4
\end{align*}
\]

we need to compute the value of \( x \).

First, we solve the system of equations using standard algebraic techniques. We start by eliminating one of the variables by manipulating the equations. We can use the method of elimination by multiplying the second equation by 3 and the first equation by 2 to align the coefficients of \( x \):

\[
\begin{align*}
2(3x + 4y - 12z) &= 2 \cdot 10 \\
3(2x + 3y - 9z) &= 3 \cdot (-4)
\end{align*}
\]

This results in:

\[
\begin{align*}
6x + 8y - 24z &= 20 \\
6x + 9y - 27z &= -12
\end{align*}
\]

Subtracting the second modified equation from the first, we get:

\[
(6x + 8y - 24z) - (6x + 9y - 27z) = 20 - (-12)
\]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
-y + 3z = 32
\]

Next, we solve for \( y \) in terms of \( z \):

\[
y = 3z - 32
\]

We substitute \( y = 3z - 32 \) back into one of the original equations to solve for \( z \). Using the first equation:

\[
3x + 4(3z - 32) - 12z = 10
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
3x + 12z - 128 - 12z = 10
\]

\[
3x - 128 = 10
\]

\[
3x = 138
\]

\[
x = 46
\]

However, this result does not match the expected value of \( x \). Let's re-evaluate the steps to ensure correctness.
