  Given the system of linear equations:
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  3x + 4y - 12z &= 10, \\
  -2x - 3y + 9z &= -4,
  \end{align*}
  \]
  we need to compute \( x \). By solving these equations step-by-step, we find that \( x = 14 \).

  -- We need to solve the system of equations for x.
  have : x = 14 := by
    -- Use the `nlinarith` tactic to solve the system of linear equations.
    -- `nlinarith` is a tactic that can handle nonlinear arithmetic expressions.
    -- Here, it will automatically find a solution for x by leveraging the given equations.
    nlinarith
  -- Simplify the goal using the derived value of x.
