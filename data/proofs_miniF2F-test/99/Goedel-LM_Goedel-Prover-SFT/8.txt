  Given the system of linear equations:
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  3x + 4y - 12z &= 10 \\
  -2x - 3y + 9z &= -4
  \end{align*}
  \]
  We need to compute the value of \( x \). By using linear algebra techniques, specifically the method of solving linear equations, we can derive that \( x = 14 \).
  -/
  -- Use the `nlinarith` tactic to solve the system of linear equations.
  -- This tactic automatically handles linear arithmetic and will find the value of `x`.
  nlinarith
  -- The `nlinarith` tactic will derive that `x = 14`, which is the desired result.
