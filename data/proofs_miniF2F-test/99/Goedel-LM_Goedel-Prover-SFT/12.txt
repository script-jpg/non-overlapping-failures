Given the system of linear equations:

\[
\begin{align*}
3x + 4y - 12z &= 10, \\
-2x - 3y + 9z &= -4,
\end{align*}
\]

we need to compute the value of \( x \).

First, we manipulate the second equation by multiplying both sides by 3 to align the coefficients of \( y \) and \( z \) with the first equation:

\[
-6x - 9y + 27z = -12.
\]

Next, we add this equation to the first equation:

\[
(3x + 4y - 12z) + (-6x - 9y + 27z) = 10 + (-12).
\]

Simplifying the left-hand side:

\[
3x - 6x + 4y - 9y - 12z + 27z = -2.
\]

Combining like terms:

\[
-3x - 5y + 15z = -2.
\]

We then multiply the first equation by 2 to align the coefficients of \( x \) and \( y \) with the second equation:

\[
6x + 8y - 24z = 20.
\]

Finally, we add this equation to the second equation:

\[
(-2x - 3y + 9z) + (6x + 8y - 24z) = -4 + 20.
\]

Simplifying the left-hand side:

\[
4x + 5y - 15z = 16.
\]

Solving the system, we find:

\[
x = 14.
\]
