  Given the system of linear equations:
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  3x + 4y - 12z &= 10, \\
  -2x - 3y + 9z &= -4,
  \end{align*}
  \]
  we need to compute \( x \). We will show that \( x = 14 \).
  First, we add the two equations to eliminate \( x \):
  \[
  (3x + 4y - 12z) + (-2x - 3y + 9z) = 10 + (-4).
  \]
  Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:
  \[
  (3x - 2x) + (4y - 3y) + (-12z + 9z) = x + y - 3z.
  \]
  Thus, the equation becomes:
  \[
  x + y - 3z = 6.
  \]
  Next, we subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate \( y \):
  \[
  (3x + 4y - 12z) - (-2x - 3y + 9z) = 10 - (-4).
  \]
  Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:
  \[
  (3x + 2x) + (4y + 3y) - (12z + 9z) = 5x + 7y - 21z.
  \]
  Thus, the equation becomes:
  \[
  5x + 7y - 21z = 14.
  \]
  We now have two new equations:
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  x + y - 3z &= 6, \\
  5x + 7y - 21z &= 14.
  \end{align*}
  \]
  By manipulating these equations, we can solve for \( x \). We can isolate \( x \) by adding and subtracting multiples of the equations. After simplifying, we find that \( x = 14 \).
