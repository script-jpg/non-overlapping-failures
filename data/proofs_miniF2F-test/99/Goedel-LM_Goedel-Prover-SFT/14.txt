  Given the system of linear equations:
  \[
  \begin{align*}
  3x + 4y - 12z &= 10, \\
  -2x - 3y + 9z &= -4,
  \end{align*}
  \]
  we need to compute \( x \).
  First, we normalize the equations by expanding and simplifying them. Then, we use linear algebraic manipulation to solve for \( x \). By applying the `linarith` tactic, which simplifies the system of linear equations and solves for \( x \), we find that \( x = 14 \).
