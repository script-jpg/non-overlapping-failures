have h₂ := h₀
  have h₃ := h₁
  -- We need to solve for x using the given equations.
  -- First, we will eliminate z by manipulating the equations.
  -- Multiply the first equation by 3 and the second by 4 to align the coefficients of z.
  have h₄ : 9 * x + 12 * y - 36 * z = 30 := by linarith
  have h₅ : -8 * x - 12 * y + 36 * z = -16 := by linarith
  -- Add the modified equations to eliminate y and z.
  have h₆ : x = 14 := by linarith
  -- The result is x = 14.
