-- We have two equations with three variables. To find the value of $x$, we need to eliminate $y$ and $z$.

  -- Let's multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 4 to make the coefficients of $y$ equal:
  have h₂ : 9 * x + 12 * y - 36 * z = 30 := by
    linarith [h₀]
  have h₃ : -8 * x - 12 * y + 36 * z = -16 := by
    linarith [h₁]

  -- Now, add the two equations to eliminate $y$ and $z$:
  have h₄ : x = 14 := by
    linarith [h₂, h₃]

  -- Hence, $x = 14$.
  exact h₄
