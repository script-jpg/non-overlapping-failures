-- We have a system of two equations with three variables.
  -- Let's try to express $x$ in terms of the other variables.
  have eq_x : x = 14 := by
    linarith

  -- The `linarith` tactic is powerful for solving linear arithmetic problems.
  -- It automatically combines the given equations to isolate $x$.
  -- Let's see how we could do this manually:
  --
  -- If we multiply the first equation by 3 and the second by 4, we get:
  --
  -- \begin{align*}
  -- 9x+12y-36z&=30,\\
  -- -8x-12y+36z&=-16.
  -- \end{align*}
  --
  -- Adding these gives: $x=14$.
