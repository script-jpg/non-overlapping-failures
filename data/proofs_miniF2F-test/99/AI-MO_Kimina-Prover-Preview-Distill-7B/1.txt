-- Compute `x` from the given equations.

  -- We first multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 4
  -- so that the coefficients of $y$ are the same.
  -- Then we add the two equations to eliminate $y$.
  have h₃ : 3 * (3 * x + 4 * y - 12 * z) + 4 * (-2 * x - 3 * y + 9 * z) = 3 * 10 + 4 * (-4) := by
