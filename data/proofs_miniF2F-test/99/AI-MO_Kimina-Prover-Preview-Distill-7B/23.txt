-- To compute $x$, we need to eliminate $y$ and $z$ from the given system.
  -- We can do this by multiplying the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 4,
  -- adding them and then solving for $x$.
  have h₃ : 3 * (3 * x + 4 * y - 12 * z) + 4 * (-2 * x - 3 * y + 9 * z) = 3 * 10 + 4 * (-4) := by
    rw [h₀, h₁]

  -- Simplify the equation to get $x = 14$.
