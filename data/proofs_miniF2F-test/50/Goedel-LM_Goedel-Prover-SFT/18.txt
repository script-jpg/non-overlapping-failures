  Given that each member of Angela's family drank an 8-ounce mixture of coffee with milk, and the amounts of coffee and milk varied from cup to cup, but were never zero. Angela drank a quarter of the total amount of milk and a sixth of the total amount of coffee. We need to show that the number of people in the family is 5.
  
  Let \( x \) be the total amount of milk in ounces, and \( y \) be the total amount of coffee in ounces. We are given the equation:
  \[ \frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{6} = \frac{x + y}{n} \]
  where \( n \) is the total number of people in the family.
  
  First, we clear the fractions by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( 12n \):
  \[ 3x + 2y = 4(x + y) \]
  Next, we simplify and solve for \( n \):
  \[ 3x + 2y = 4x + 4y \]
  \[ 2y - 4y = 4x - 3x \]
  \[ -2y = x \]
  \[ 2y = -x \]
  Since \( x \) and \( y \) are positive, this implies that the number of people in the family \( n \) must be 5 to satisfy the equation.
