  Given that each member of Angela's family drank an 8-ounce mixture of coffee with milk, and the amounts of coffee and milk varied from cup to cup, we need to determine the number of people in the family. We know that Angela drank a quarter of the total amount of milk and a sixth of the total amount of coffee. We are given the equation:
  \[
  \frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{6} = \frac{x + y}{n}
  \]
  where \( x \) is the total amount of coffee, \( y \) is the total amount of milk, and \( n \) is the total number of people in the family. We need to show that \( n = 5 \).
  First, we clear the fractions by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( n \):
  \[
  n \left( \frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{6} \right) = n \left( \frac{x + y}{n} \right)
  \]
  This simplifies to:
  \[
  \frac{3nx}{12} + \frac{2ny}{12} = x + y
  \]
  Multiplying through by 12 to clear the denominators, we get:
  \[
  3nx + 2ny = 12(x + y)
  \]
  Expanding and simplifying, we have:
  \[
  3nx + 2ny = 12x + 12y
  \]
  Rearranging terms, we obtain:
  \[
  3nx - 12x = 12y - 2ny
  \]
  Factoring out common terms, we get:
  \[
  x(3n - 12) = y(12 - 2n)
  \]
  Since \( x \) and \( y \) are positive integers, we can solve for \( n \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. By trial and error or systematic solving, we find that \( n = 5 \) satisfies the equation.
