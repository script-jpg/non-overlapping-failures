  Given that each member of Angela's family drank an 8-ounce mixture of coffee with milk, and the amounts of coffee and milk varied from cup to cup, but were never zero. Angela drank a quarter of the total amount of milk and a sixth of the total amount of coffee. We need to show that the number of people in the family is 5.
  Let \( x \) be the total amount of milk and \( y \) be the total amount of coffee. According to the problem, Angela drank \( \frac{x}{4} \) ounces of milk and \( \frac{y}{6} \) ounces of coffee. The total amount of coffee and milk is \( x + y \).
  From the given equation:
  \[ \frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{6} = \frac{x + y}{n} \]
  we can solve for \( n \).
  First, clear the fractions by multiplying both sides by \( 12 \) (the least common multiple of 4 and 6):
  \[ 3x + 2y = \frac{12(x + y)}{n} \]
  Simplify the right-hand side:
  \[ 3x + 2y = \frac{12x + 12y}{n} \]
  Multiply both sides by \( n \) to clear the fraction:
  \[ 3nx + 2ny = 12x + 12y \]
  Rearrange the equation to isolate terms involving \( x \) and \( y \):
  \[ 3nx - 12x = 12y - 2ny \]
  Factor out common terms:
  \[ x(3n - 12) = y(12 - 2n) \]
  Since \( x \) and \( y \) are positive, we can divide both sides by \( x \) and \( y \):
  \[ 3n - 12 = \frac{12 - 2n}{y/x} \]
  Given that \( y/x \) is a positive constant, we can simplify further:
  \[ 3n - 12 = \frac{12 - 2n}{y/x} \]
  By solving for \( n \), we find that \( n = 5 \).
