  Given that each member of Angela's family drank an 8-ounce mixture of coffee with milk, and the amounts of coffee and milk varied from cup to cup, we need to show that the total number of people in the family is 5. We know that Angela drank a quarter of the total amount of milk and a sixth of the total amount of coffee.
  Let \( x \) be the total amount of milk and \( y \) be the total amount of coffee. We are given the equation:
  \[ \frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{6} = \frac{x + y}{n} \]
  First, we clear the fractions by multiplying through by \( 12n \):
  \[ 3nx + 2ny = 2(x + y)n \]
  Expanding and simplifying:
  \[ 3nx + 2ny = 2xn + 2yn \]
  \[ 3nx - 2xn = 2yn - 2ny \]
  \[ nx = -ny \]
  \[ nx + ny = 0 \]
  \[ n(x + y) = 0 \]
  Since \( n \) is a positive integer, we must have:
  \[ x + y = 0 \]
  This implies:
  \[ x = -y \]
  Given that \( x \) and \( y \) are positive, this is a contradiction. Therefore, we must have made an error in our assumptions or calculations. However, the problem states that the total number of people \( n \) is 5, which implies that the equation must hold true for some positive integers \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy the given conditions.
