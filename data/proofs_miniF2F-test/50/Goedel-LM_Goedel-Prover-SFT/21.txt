  Given that each member of Angela's family drank an 8-ounce mixture of coffee with milk, and the amounts of coffee and milk varied from cup to cup, but were never zero. Angela drank a quarter of the total amount of milk and a sixth of the total amount of coffee. We need to show that there are 5 people in the family.
  Let \( x \) be the number of people in the family and \( y \) be the total amount of milk. According to the problem, Angela drank \( \frac{x}{4} \) of the total milk and \( \frac{y}{6} \) of the total coffee. The total amount of coffee and milk together is \( x + y \).
  From the given equation:
  \[ \frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{6} = \frac{x + y}{n} \]
  We can solve for \( n \). First, we clear the fractions by multiplying both sides by \( 12n \):
  \[ 3x + 2y = 2(x + y) \]
  Simplifying this equation:
  \[ 3x + 2y = 2x + 2y \]
  \[ 3x - 2x = 0 \]
  \[ x = 0 \]
  This implies \( x \) is zero, which contradicts the assumption that \( x \) is a positive integer. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate our steps.
  Given the constraints and the initial conditions, we should directly solve for \( n \) using the given equation and the properties of integers.
