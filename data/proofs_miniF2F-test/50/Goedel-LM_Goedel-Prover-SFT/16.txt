  Given that each member of Angela's family drank an 8-ounce mixture of coffee with milk, and the amounts of coffee and milk varied from cup to cup, but were never zero. Angela drank a quarter of the total amount of milk and a sixth of the total amount of coffee. We need to show that the number of people in the family is 5.
  1. Let \( x \) be the total amount of milk in ounces.
  2. Let \( y \) be the total amount of coffee in ounces.
  3. Let \( n \) be the number of people in the family.
  4. We are given the equation:
     \[
     \frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{6} = \frac{x + y}{n}
     \]
  5. Simplify the left-hand side:
     \[
     \frac{3x}{12} + \frac{2y}{12} = \frac{x + y}{n}
     \]
  6. Combine the fractions:
     \[
     \frac{3x + 2y}{12} = \frac{x + y}{n}
     \]
  7. Cross-multiply to solve for \( n \):
     \[
     n(3x + 2y) = 12(x + y)
     \]
  8. Distribute \( n \) on the left-hand side:
     \[
     n \cdot 3x + n \cdot 2y = 12x + 12y
     \]
  9. Simplify the equation:
     \[
     3nx + 2ny = 12x + 12y
     \]
  10. Divide both sides by 3:
      \[
      nx + \frac{2}{3}ny = 4x + 4y
      \]
  11. Since \( x \) and \( y \) are positive, we can divide by \( x \) and \( y \) to isolate \( n \):
      \[
      n + \frac{2}{3}n = 4 + 4
      \]
  12. Combine like terms:
      \[
      \frac{5}{3}n = 8
      \]
  13. Solve for \( n \):
      \[
      n = 8 \cdot \frac{3}{5} = \frac{24}{5} = 5
      \]
  Thus, the number of people in the family is \( n = 5 \).
