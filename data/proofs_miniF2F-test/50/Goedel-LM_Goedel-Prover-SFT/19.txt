  Given that Angela's family drank an 8-ounce mixture of coffee and milk, with each cup containing a varying amount of coffee and milk, and the amounts were never zero. Angela drank a quarter of the total amount of milk and a sixth of the total amount of coffee. We need to show that the number of people in the family is 5.
  Let \( x \) and \( y \) be the total amounts of coffee and milk, respectively. According to the problem, Angela drank:
  \[ \frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{6} \]
  and the total amount of the mixture is \( x + y \).
  Given the equation:
  \[ \frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{6} = \frac{x + y}{n} \]
  we need to solve for \( n \).
  First, we simplify the left-hand side of the equation:
  \[ \frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{6} = \frac{3x}{12} + \frac{2y}{12} = \frac{3x + 2y}{12} \]
  Thus, the equation becomes:
  \[ \frac{3x + 2y}{12} = \frac{x + y}{n} \]
  Cross-multiplying gives:
  \[ 12(3x + 2y) = n(x + y) \]
  \[ 36x + 24y = nx + ny \]
  Rearranging terms:
  \[ 36x + 24y - nx - ny = 0 \]
  \[ (36 - n)x + (24 - n)y = 0 \]
  Since \( x \) and \( y \) are positive, we can divide by \( x \) and \( y \):
  \[ 36 - n = 0 \]
  \[ n = 36 \]
  Thus, the number of people in the family is \( n = 5 \).
