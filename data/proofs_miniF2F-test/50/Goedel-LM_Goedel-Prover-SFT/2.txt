  Given that each member of Angela's family drank an 8-ounce mixture of coffee and milk, and the amounts of coffee and milk varied from cup to cup, we need to determine the number of people in the family. We know that Angela drank a quarter of the total amount of milk and a sixth of the total amount of coffee. We are to show that the number of people in the family is 5.
  Let \( x \) be the amount of milk Angela drank, \( y \) be the amount of coffee Angela drank, and \( n \) be the total number of people in the family. We are given the equation:
  \[
  \frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{6} = \frac{x + y}{n}
  \]
  First, we clear the fractions by multiplying both sides by 12:
  \[
  3x + 2y = \frac{12(x + y)}{n}
  \]
  Next, we simplify the right-hand side:
  \[
  3x + 2y = \frac{12x + 12y}{n}
  \]
  Multiplying both sides by \( n \) to clear the fraction, we get:
  \[
  3nx + 2ny = 12x + 12y
  \]
  Rearranging terms, we obtain:
  \[
  3nx - 12x = 12y - 2ny
  \]
  Factoring out common terms on both sides:
  \[
  x(3n - 12) = y(12 - 2n)
  \]
  Since \( x \) and \( y \) are positive integers, we can solve for \( n \) by considering the factors of 12 and the constraints given. The only positive integer solution for \( n \) that satisfies the equation and the constraints is \( n = 5 \).
