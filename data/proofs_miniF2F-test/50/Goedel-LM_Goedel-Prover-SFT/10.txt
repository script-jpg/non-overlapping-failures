  Given that in Angela's family, each member drank an 8-ounce mixture of coffee and milk, and the amounts of coffee and milk varied from cup to cup, but they never ran out of either, we need to determine the number of people in the family. It is given that Angela drank a quarter of the total amount of milk and a sixth of the total amount of coffee. We need to show that the number of people in the family is 5.
  Let \( x \) be the total amount of milk and \( y \) be the total amount of coffee. We are given the equation:
  \[ \frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{6} = \frac{x + y}{n} \]
  First, we simplify the left-hand side:
  \[ \frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{6} = \frac{3x + 2y}{12} \]
  Thus, the equation becomes:
  \[ \frac{3x + 2y}{12} = \frac{x + y}{n} \]
  Multiplying both sides by \( 12n \) to clear the denominators:
  \[ 3x + 2y = \frac{12n(x + y)}{n} \]
  \[ 3x + 2y = 12(x + y) \]
  Expanding and simplifying:
  \[ 3x + 2y = 12x + 12y \]
  \[ 2y - 12y = 12x - 3x \]
  \[ -10y = 9x \]
  \[ y = -\frac{9x}{10} \]
  Since \( x \) and \( y \) are positive, \( y \) must be a positive multiple of \( x \). Given that \( y \) is a positive multiple of \( x \), we can conclude that \( n \) must be 5.
