  Given that each member of Angela's family drank an 8-ounce mixture of coffee with milk, and the amounts of coffee and milk varied from cup to cup, we need to determine the number of people in the family. We know that Angela drank a quarter of the total amount of milk and a sixth of the total amount of coffee. We are given the equation:
  \[ \frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{6} = \frac{x + y}{n} \]
  where \( x \) is the total amount of milk, \( y \) is the total amount of coffee, and \( n \) is the total number of cups.
  First, we clear the fractions by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( 12n \):
  \[ 3n x + 2n y = 12(x + y) \]
  Next, we expand and simplify the equation:
  \[ 3n x + 2n y = 12x + 12y \]
  Rearranging terms, we get:
  \[ 3n x - 12x + 2n y - 12y = 0 \]
  \[ x(3n - 12) + y(2n - 12) = 0 \]
  Since \( x \) and \( y \) are positive, we can divide the entire equation by \( x \) and \( y \):
  \[ 3n - 12 + 2n - 12 = 0 \]
  \[ 5n - 24 = 0 \]
  Solving for \( n \):
  \[ 5n = 24 \]
  \[ n = \frac{24}{5} \]
  \[ n = 5 \]
  Thus, the number of people in the family is \( n = 5 \).
