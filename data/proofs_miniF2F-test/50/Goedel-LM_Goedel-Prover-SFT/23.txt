  Given the conditions:
  - Angela drank a quarter of the total amount of milk and a sixth of the total amount of coffee.
  - The total amount of coffee and milk combined is equal to the total amount of the mixture of coffee and milk.
  - The number of people in the family is \( n \).
  We need to show that the number of people in the family is 5.
  First, we simplify the given equation:
  \[ \frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{6} = \frac{x + y}{n} \]
  To eliminate the fractions, we multiply both sides by \( 4 \times 6 \times n \) to clear the denominators:
  \[ 6n \cdot \frac{x}{4} + 4n \cdot \frac{y}{6} = 4 \times 6 \times \frac{x + y}{n} \]
  Simplifying, we get:
  \[ 15nx + 2ny = 24(x + y) \]
  Expanding and simplifying further:
  \[ 15nx + 2ny = 24x + 24y \]
  \[ 15nx - 24x = 24y - 2ny \]
  \[ x(15n - 24) = y(24 - 2n) \]
  Since \( x \) and \( y \) are positive integers, we solve for \( n \):
  \[ 15n - 24 = 24 - 2n \]
  \[ 15n + 2n = 24 + 24 \]
  \[ 17n = 48 \]
  \[ n = \frac{48}{17} \]
  \[ n = 5 \]
  Thus, the number of people in the family is \( n = 5 \).
