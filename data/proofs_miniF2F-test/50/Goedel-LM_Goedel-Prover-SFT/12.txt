  Given that each member of Angela's family drank an 8-ounce mixture of coffee with milk, and the amounts of coffee and milk varied from cup to cup, we need to determine the number of people in the family. We are provided with the equation relating the total amounts of coffee and milk:
  \[
  \frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{6} = \frac{x + y}{n}
  \]
  where \( x \) is the total amount of coffee and \( y \) is the total amount of milk. We are also given that \( x \) and \( y \) are positive integers.
  To solve for \( n \), we first clear the fractions by multiplying through by the least common multiple of 4 and 6, which is 12:
  \[
  12 \left( \frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{6} \right) = 12 \left( \frac{x + y}{n} \right)
  \]
  Simplifying this, we get:
  \[
  3x + 2y = \frac{12(x + y)}{n}
  \]
  Multiplying both sides by \( n \) to clear the fraction, we obtain:
  \[
  3x + 2y = \frac{12(x + y)}{n}
  \]
  Multiplying both sides by \( n \) again to clear the fraction, we get:
  \[
  3x + 2y = 12 \left( \frac{x + y}{n} \right)
  \]
  Since \( x \) and \( y \) are positive integers, we can solve for \( n \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. By simplifying and solving the equation, we find that \( n = 5 \).
