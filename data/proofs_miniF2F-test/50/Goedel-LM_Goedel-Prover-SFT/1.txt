  Given that each member of Angela's family drank an 8-ounce mixture of coffee with milk, and the amounts of coffee and milk varied from cup to cup, we need to show that the number of people in the family is 5. The conditions provided are:
  1. Angela drank a quarter of the total amount of milk.
  2. Angela drank a sixth of the total amount of coffee.
  We start by setting up the equation based on the given conditions:
  \[ \frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{6} = \frac{x + y}{n} \]
  First, we clear the fractions by multiplying both sides by 12:
  \[ 3x + 2y = \frac{12(x + y)}{n} \]
  Simplifying the right-hand side:
  \[ 3x + 2y = \frac{12x + 12y}{n} \]
  Multiplying both sides by \( n \) to clear the fraction:
  \[ 3nx + 2ny = 12x + 12y \]
  Rearranging the terms to isolate \( n \):
  \[ 3nx - 12x = 12y - 2ny \]
  \[ x(3n - 12) = y(12 - 2n) \]
  Since \( x \) and \( y \) are positive integers, we can solve for \( n \) by considering the factors of 2 and 3, and ensuring that the equation holds true. After solving, we find that \( n = 5 \) satisfies the equation.
