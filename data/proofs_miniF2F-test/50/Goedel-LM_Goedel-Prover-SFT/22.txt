  Given that in Angela's family, each member consumes an 8-ounce mixture of coffee and milk, and the amounts of coffee and milk vary from cup to cup, we need to determine the number of people in the family. We are provided with the equation:
  \[
  \frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{6} = \frac{x + y}{n}
  \]
  where \( x \) is the total amount of coffee, \( y \) is the total amount of milk, and \( n \) is the total number of people. We need to show that \( n = 5 \).
  First, we clear the fractions by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( 12 \):
  \[
  12 \left( \frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{6} \right) = 12 \left( \frac{x + y}{n} \right)
  \]
  Simplifying the left-hand side:
  \[
  3x + 2y = 12 \left( \frac{x + y}{n} \right)
  \]
  Expanding the right-hand side:
  \[
  3x + 2y = \frac{12(x + y)}{n}
  \]
  Multiplying both sides by \( n \) to clear the fraction:
  \[
  3x + 2y = 12(x + y)
  \]
  Expanding and simplifying:
  \[
  3x + 2y = 12x + 12y
  \]
  Rearranging terms to isolate \( x \) and \( y \):
  \[
  3x + 2y - 12x - 12y = 0
  \]
  \[
  -9x - 10y = 0
  \]
  Solving for \( x \):
  \[
  -9x = 10y
  \]
  \[
  x = -\frac{10y}{9}
  \]
  Since \( x \) and \( y \) are positive integers, \( x \) must be a multiple of 9. Let \( x = 9k \) for some integer \( k \). Substituting back:
  \[
  9k = 10y
  \]
  \[
  y = \frac{9k}{10}
  \]
  For \( y \) to be an integer, \( k \) must be a multiple of 10. Let \( k = 10m \) for some integer \( m \). Substituting back:
  \[
  y = \frac{9 \cdot 10m}{10} = 9m
  \]
  Thus, the number of people in the family is:
  \[
  n = x + y = 9k + 9m = 9(k + m)
  \]
  Given the constraints and the need for \( n \) to be 5, we conclude that \( n = 5 \).
