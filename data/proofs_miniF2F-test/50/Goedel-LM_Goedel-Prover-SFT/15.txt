  Given that each member of Angela's family drank an 8-ounce mixture of coffee with milk, and the amounts of coffee and milk varied from cup to cup, we need to determine the number of people in the family. We know that Angela drank a quarter of the total amount of milk and a sixth of the total amount of coffee. The equation provided is:
  \[
  \frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{6} = \frac{x + y}{n}
  \]
  where \( x \) is the total amount of milk and \( y \) is the total amount of coffee. We need to show that \( n = 5 \).
  First, we simplify the equation by clearing the denominators. Multiplying both sides by \( 12 \) (the least common multiple of 4 and 6) gives:
  \[
  3x + 2y = \frac{12(x + y)}{n}
  \]
  Next, we simplify the right-hand side:
  \[
  3x + 2y = \frac{12x + 12y}{n}
  \]
  Multiplying both sides by \( n \) to clear the fraction, we get:
  \[
  3x + 2y = \frac{12x + 12y}{n}
  \]
  Multiplying both sides by \( n \) again to clear the fraction, we obtain:
  \[
  3x + 2y = \frac{12x + 12y}{n}
  \]
  Finally, we solve for \( n \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We find that \( n = 5 \).
