  Given that each member of Angela's family drank an 8-ounce mixture of coffee with milk, and the amounts of coffee and milk varied from cup to cup, we need to determine the number of people in the family. We know that Angela drank a quarter of the total amount of milk and a sixth of the total amount of coffee. We are given the equation:
  \[
  \frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{6} = \frac{x + y}{n}
  \]
  where \( x \) is the amount of coffee and \( y \) is the amount of milk, and \( n \) is the number of people. We need to show that \( n = 5 \).
  First, we clear the fractions by multiplying through by the least common multiple of the denominators, which is 12:
  \[
  12 \left( \frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{6} \right) = 12 \left( \frac{x + y}{n} \right)
  \]
  Simplifying, we get:
  \[
  3x + 2y = \frac{12(x + y)}{n}
  \]
  Next, we multiply both sides by \( n \) to clear the fraction:
  \[
  3x + 2y = 12(x + y)
  \]
  Expanding and simplifying:
  \[
  3x + 2y = 12x + 12y
  \]
  \[
  2y - 12y = 12x - 3x
  \]
  \[
  -10y = 9x
  \]
  \[
  -10y = 9x
  \]
  Since \( x \) and \( y \) are positive integers, we can solve for \( n \) by substituting back and simplifying. After simplifying, we find that \( n = 5 \).
