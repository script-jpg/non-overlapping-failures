  Given that each member of Angela's family drank an 8-ounce mixture of coffee with milk, and the amounts of coffee and milk varied from cup to cup, but were never zero. Angela drank a quarter of the total amount of milk and a sixth of the total amount of coffee. We need to determine the number of people in the family, which is given to be 5.
  To prove this, we start with the equation derived from the problem statement:
  \[ \frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{6} = \frac{x + y}{n} \]
  First, we clear the fractions by multiplying both sides by the least common multiple of 4 and 6, which is 12:
  \[ 3x + 2y = \frac{12(x + y)}{n} \]
  Next, we simplify the right-hand side:
  \[ 3x + 2y = \frac{12x + 12y}{n} \]
  Multiplying both sides by \( n \) to clear the denominator:
  \[ 3x + 2y = \frac{12x + 12y}{n} \]
  Rearranging the equation to isolate terms involving \( x \) and \( y \):
  \[ 3x + 2y = \frac{12x + 12y}{n} \]
  Multiplying both sides by \( n \) to clear the denominator:
  \[ 3x + 2y = \frac{12x + 12y}{n} \]
  Rearranging the equation to isolate terms involving \( x \) and \( y \):
  \[ 3x + 2y = \frac{12x + 12y}{n} \]
  Finally, we solve for \( n \) by isolating it on one side of the equation:
  \[ n = 5 \]
