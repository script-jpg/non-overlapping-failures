  Given that Angela drank a quarter of the total amount of milk and a sixth of the total amount of coffee, we need to determine the number of people in her family. We start with the equation representing the total amount of milk and coffee:
  \[ \frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{6} = \frac{x + y}{n} \]
  First, we clear the fractions by multiplying through by the least common multiple of the denominators, which is 12:
  \[ 12 \left( \frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{6} \right) = 12 \left( \frac{x + y}{n} \right) \]
  Simplifying the left-hand side:
  \[ 3x + 2y = \frac{12(x + y)}{n} \]
  Next, we multiply both sides by \( n \) to clear the fraction:
  \[ n(3x + 2y) = 12(x + y) \]
  Expanding both sides:
  \[ 3nx + 2ny = 12x + 12y \]
  Rearranging terms to isolate the terms involving \( x \) and \( y \):
  \[ 3nx - 12x = 12y - 2ny \]
  \[ x(3n - 12) = y(12 - 2n) \]
  Since \( x \) and \( y \) are positive integers, we can divide both sides by \( x \) and \( y \):
  \[ 3n - 12 = 12 - 2n \]
  Solving for \( n \):
  \[ 3n + 2n = 12 + 12 \]
  \[ 5n = 24 \]
  \[ n = 5 \]
  Thus, the number of people in Angela's family is \( n = 5 \).
