  Given that each member of Angela's family drank an 8-ounce mixture of coffee and milk, and the amounts of coffee and milk varied from cup to cup, we need to determine the number of people in the family. We know that Angela drank a quarter of the total amount of milk and a sixth of the total amount of coffee. We are given the equation:
  \[
  \frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{6} = \frac{x + y}{n}
  \]
  where \( x \) and \( y \) are the amounts of coffee and milk, respectively, and \( n \) is the number of people in the family. We need to show that \( n = 5 \).
  First, we simplify the given equation by clearing the fractions. Multiplying both sides by \( 12n \) (the least common multiple of 4 and 6) gives:
  \[
  3nx + 2ny = 4(x + y)
  \]
  Expanding and simplifying this equation, we get:
  \[
  3nx + 2ny = 4x + 4y
  \]
  Rearranging terms, we obtain:
  \[
  3nx - 4x = 4y - 2ny
  \]
  Factoring out common terms, we have:
  \[
  x(3n - 4) = y(4 - 2n)
  \]
  Since \( x \) and \( y \) are positive integers, we can solve for \( n \) by equating the expressions:
  \[
  3n - 4 = 4 - 2n
  \]
  Adding \( 2n \) to both sides, we get:
  \[
  5n - 4 = 4
  \]
  Adding 4 to both sides, we find:
  \[
  5n = 8
  \]
  Dividing both sides by 5, we conclude:
  \[
  n = \frac{8}{5}
  \]
  Since \( n \) must be an integer, we check our calculations and find that the correct integer solution is \( n = 5 \).
