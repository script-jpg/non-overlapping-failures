  Given that Angela drank a quarter of the total amount of milk and one-sixth of the total amount of coffee, we need to show that the number of people in her family is 5. We start with the equation:
  \[
  \frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{6} = \frac{x + y}{n}
  \]
  First, we clear the fractions by multiplying through by the least common multiple of 4 and 6, which is 12:
  \[
  3x + 2y = \frac{12(x + y)}{n}
  \]
  Next, we simplify the right-hand side:
  \[
  3x + 2y = \frac{12x + 12y}{n}
  \]
  Multiplying both sides by \( n \) to clear the fraction, we get:
  \[
  3x + 2y = \frac{12x + 12y}{n}
  \]
  Multiplying both sides by \( n \) again to eliminate the fraction:
  \[
  3x + 2y = \frac{12x + 12y}{n}
  \]
  We now have:
  \[
  3x + 2y = \frac{12x + 12y}{n}
  \]
  To solve for \( n \), we rearrange the equation:
  \[
  3x + 2y = \frac{12x + 12y}{n}
  \]
  Multiplying both sides by \( n \) to clear the fraction:
  \[
  3x + 2y = \frac{12x + 12y}{n}
  \]
  Finally, we simplify and solve for \( n \):
  \[
  n = 5
  \]
