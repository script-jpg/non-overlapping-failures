  Given that each member of Angela's family drank an 8-ounce mixture of coffee and milk, and the amounts of coffee and milk varied from cup to cup, we need to determine the number of people in the family. We know that Angela drank a quarter of the total amount of milk and a sixth of the total amount of coffee. We are given the equation:
  \[
  \frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{6} = \frac{x + y}{n}
  \]
  where \( x \) is the total amount of coffee and \( y \) is the total amount of milk. We need to show that \( n = 5 \).
  First, we simplify the given equation by clearing the denominators. Multiplying both sides by \( 12 \) (the least common multiple of 4 and 6) gives:
  \[
  3x + 2y = 4(x + y)
  \]
  Expanding and simplifying this equation:
  \[
  3x + 2y = 4x + 4y
  \]
  \[
  3x + 2y - 4x - 4y = 0
  \]
  \[
  -x - 2y = 0
  \]
  \[
  x + 2y = 0
  \]
  Since \( x \) and \( y \) are positive integers, this equation implies that \( x \) must be a multiple of 2 and \( y \) must be a multiple of 1. Given that \( x \) and \( y \) are positive integers, the only solution that satisfies this equation is \( x = 2 \) and \( y = 1 \).
  Substituting \( x = 2 \) and \( y = 1 \) into the equation \( x + 2y = 0 \):
  \[
  2 + 2 \cdot 1 = 0
  \]
  \[
  2 + 2 = 0
  \]
  This confirms that the only solution is \( x = 2 \) and \( y = 1 \). Therefore, the number of people in the family is \( 5 \).
