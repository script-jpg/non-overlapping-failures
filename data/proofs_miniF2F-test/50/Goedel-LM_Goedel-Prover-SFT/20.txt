  Given that Angela drank a quarter of the total amount of milk and a sixth of the total amount of coffee, we need to determine the number of people in the family. We start with the equation:
  \[
  \frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{6} = \frac{x + y}{n}
  \]
  First, we clear the fractions by multiplying through by the least common multiple of 4 and 6, which is 12:
  \[
  3x + 2y = \frac{12(x + y)}{n}
  \]
  Next, we simplify the equation:
  \[
  3x + 2y = \frac{12x + 12y}{n}
  \]
  Multiplying both sides by \( n \) to clear the fraction, we get:
  \[
  3nx + 2ny = 12x + 12y
  \]
  Rearranging terms, we have:
  \[
  3nx - 12x = 12y - 2ny
  \]
  Factoring out common terms on both sides:
  \[
  x(3n - 12) = y(12 - 2n)
  \]
  Since \( x \) and \( y \) are positive integers, we can solve for \( n \) by equating the expressions:
  \[
  3n - 12 = \frac{12 - 2n}{y}
  \]
  Given that \( y \) is a positive integer, the only value of \( n \) that satisfies this equation is \( n = 5 \).
