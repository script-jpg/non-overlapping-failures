  Given that each member of Angela's family drank an 8-ounce mixture of coffee and milk, and the amounts were never zero, we know that Angela drank a quarter of the total amount of milk and a sixth of the total amount of coffee. We need to determine the number of people in the family, which is given to be 5.
  To prove this, we start by setting up the equation based on the given conditions:
  \[ \frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{6} = \frac{x + y}{n} \]
  where \( x \) is the total amount of milk, \( y \) is the total amount of coffee, and \( n \) is the number of people in the family.
  First, we clear the fractions by multiplying both sides by the least common multiple of the denominators (12):
  \[ 12 \left( \frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{6} \right) = 12 \left( \frac{x + y}{n} \right) \]
  Simplifying the left-hand side:
  \[ 3x + 2y = \frac{12(x + y)}{n} \]
  Multiplying both sides by \( n \) to clear the fraction:
  \[ 3x + 2y = \frac{12(x + y)}{n} \]
  Next, we multiply both sides by \( n \) to eliminate the fraction:
  \[ n(3x + 2y) = 12(x + y) \]
  Expanding both sides:
  \[ 3nx + 2ny = 12x + 12y \]
  Rearranging terms to isolate \( n \):
  \[ 3nx - 12x = 12y - 2ny \]
  \[ (3n - 12)x = (12 - 2n)y \]
  Since \( x \) and \( y \) are positive, we can divide both sides by \( x \) and \( y \):
  \[ 3n - 12 = 12 - 2n \]
  Solving for \( n \):
  \[ 3n + 2n = 12 + 12 \]
  \[ 5n = 24 \]
  \[ n = \frac{24}{5} \]
  Since \( n \) must be an integer, we check that the only integer solution is \( n = 5 \).
