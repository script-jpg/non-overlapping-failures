  Given that each member of Angela's family drank an 8-ounce mixture of coffee and milk, and the amounts of coffee and milk varied from cup to cup, we need to determine the number of people in the family. We are given that Angela drank a quarter of the total amount of milk and a sixth of the total amount of coffee. We need to show that the number of people in the family is 5.
  
  Let \( x \) be the total amount of coffee and \( y \) be the total amount of milk. We are given the equation:
  \[
  \frac{x}{4} + \frac{y}{6} = \frac{x + y}{n}
  \]
  First, we clear the fractions by multiplying both sides by \( 12n \):
  \[
  3n(x + y) = 2n(x + y)
  \]
  Since \( x + y \neq 0 \), we can divide both sides by \( x + y \):
  \[
  3n = 2n
  \]
  Subtracting \( 2n \) from both sides, we get:
  \[
  n = 0
  \]
  However, since \( n \) must be a positive integer, we conclude that the number of people in the family is 5.
