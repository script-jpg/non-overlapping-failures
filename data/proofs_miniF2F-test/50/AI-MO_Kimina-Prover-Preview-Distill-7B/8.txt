The proof will first rewrite the given equation, then it will show that $x+y$ is divisible by $12$. It will show that $12$ is the least common multiple of $4$ and $6$, but we don't need this. Then it will show that $x+y=12$. It will also show that $12$ is positive, which is a contradiction. The final part shows that $n=5$.
The key insight is that $x+y$ is a positive number which is divisible by $12$ and is equal to $n$. Therefore, $n$ is divisible by $12$, which implies that $n=12$.
