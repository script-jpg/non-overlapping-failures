  Given a sequence of nonnegative real numbers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) such that the sum \(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = n\), we need to show that the product \(\prod_{i=1}^n a_i \leq 1\).
  To prove this, we use the property of the product of a sequence of numbers. Specifically, we use the fact that the product of a sequence of numbers is less than or equal to 1 if each number in the sequence is less than or equal to 1. This is a direct application of the AM-GM inequality, which states that for any sequence of numbers, the product is bounded by the sum of the numbers.
