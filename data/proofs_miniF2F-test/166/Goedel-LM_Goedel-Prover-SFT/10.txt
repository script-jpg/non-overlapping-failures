  We need to show that for a sequence of nonnegative real numbers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) such that \(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = n\), the product \(\prod_{i=1}^n a_i \leq 1\).
  1. **Initial Setup**: We start by noting that the sum of the sequence is given by \(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = n\).
  2. **Non-negativity of Squares**: Since all \(a_i\) are nonnegative, their squares \(a_i^2\) are also nonnegative.
  3. **AM-GM Inequality**: By the AM-GM inequality, we know that for any non-negative numbers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\),
     \[
     \frac{a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n}{n} \geq \sqrt[n]{a_1 a_2 \cdots a_n}
     \]
     Given \(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = n\), we have:
     \[
     1 \geq \sqrt[n]{a_1 a_2 \cdots a_n}
     \]
     This implies:
     \[
     a_1 a_2 \cdots a_n \leq 1
     \]
  4. **Conclusion**: Since \(a_1 a_2 \cdots a_n \leq 1\), we conclude that \(\prod_{i=1}^n a_i \leq 1\).
