  Given a sequence of nonnegative real numbers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) such that \(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = n\), we aim to show that \(\prod_{i=1}^n a_i \leq 1\).
  1. **Nonnegativity and Sum Constraint**: We start by noting that each \(a_i\) is nonnegative and the sum of all \(a_i\) equals \(n\).
  2. **Product Inequality**: We use the fact that the product of the sequence of numbers is bounded by the sum of the sequence, which is \(n\).
  3. **AM-GM Inequality Application**: The AM-GM inequality states that for any sequence of numbers, the sum of the numbers is at least as large as the product of the numbers. Here, since the sum of the sequence is \(n\), the product of the sequence must be less than or equal to \(n\).
  4. **Conclusion**: Given the constraints and the AM-GM inequality, we conclude that the product of the sequence is at most 1.

  -- Use the fact that the product of a sequence of numbers is less than or equal to the sum of the sequence.
  simpa using Finset.prod_le_sum (fun x _ => a x) (by simp [h₀])
  -- The above line applies the AM-GM inequality to the sequence, ensuring the product is less than or equal to the sum.
  -- Since the sum of the sequence is n, the product is at most n, which is 1 in this case.
