  Given a sequence of nonnegative real numbers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) such that \(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = n\), we need to show that \(\prod_{i=1}^n a_i \leq 1\).
  1. **Initial Setup**: We start by noting that the sum of the sequence \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) is given by \(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = n\).
  2. **Non-negativity and Bounds**: Since \(a_i\) are nonnegative and their sum is \(n\), we can infer that each \(a_i\) must be less than or equal to 1.
  3. **Product Inequality**: We need to show that the product \(\prod_{i=1}^n a_i\) is less than or equal to 1. Given the constraints on \(a_i\), we can use the fact that the product of a sequence of numbers each less than or equal to 1 is less than or equal to 1.
