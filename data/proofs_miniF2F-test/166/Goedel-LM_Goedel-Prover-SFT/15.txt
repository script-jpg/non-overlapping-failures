  Given a sequence of nonnegative real numbers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) such that \(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = n\), we aim to show that \(\prod_{i=1}^n a_i \leq 1\).
  1. **Base Case (n = 0):**
     - The sum of the sequence over an empty range is trivially zero.
     - The product over an empty range is also zero.
     - Since the sum is zero, the product is zero, which is less than or equal to 1.
  2. **Inductive Step:**
     - Assume the statement holds for \(n\).
     - For \(n+1\), consider the sum and product of the sequence.
     - The sum of the sequence up to \(n+1\) is the sum of the sequence up to \(n\) plus \(a_{n+1}\).
     - Since \(a_{n+1}\) is nonnegative, the new sum does not decrease the value.
     - The new product is the product of the sequence up to \(n\) multiplied by \(a_{n+1}\).
     - By the inductive hypothesis, the product of the sequence up to \(n\) is less than or equal to 1.
     - Since \(a_{n+1}\) is nonnegative, the new product is less than or equal to 1.
