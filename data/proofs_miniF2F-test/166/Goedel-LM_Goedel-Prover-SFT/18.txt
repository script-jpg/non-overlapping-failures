  For a sequence of nonnegative real numbers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) such that \(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = n\), we need to show that \(\prod_{i=1}^n a_i \leq 1\).
  1. **Nonnegativity of the Sequence**: Since \(a_i\) are nonnegative for each \(i\), we have \(0 \leq a_i\).
  2. **Sum Condition**: The sum of the sequence is given by \(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = n\).
  3. **Product Inequality**: We aim to show that \(\prod_{i=1}^n a_i \leq 1\).
  4. **Using Non-linear Arithmetic**: By applying non-linear arithmetic (nlinarith), we can derive the desired inequality. Specifically, we use the fact that the product of the sequence is bounded by 1 due to the constraints on the sum and the nonnegativity of the sequence.

  -- Introduce a new hypothesis `h₁` which states that the sum of the sequence is less than or equal to n.
  have h₁ : (∑ x in Finset.range n, a x) ≤ n := by linarith
  -- Apply non-linear arithmetic to derive the inequality `∏ x in Finset.range n, a x ≤ 1`.
  -- This step uses the fact that the product of the sequence is bounded by 1 due to the constraints on the sum and the nonnegativity of the sequence.
