  Given a sequence of nonnegative real numbers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) such that \(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = n\), we need to show that \(\prod_{i=1}^n a_i \leq 1\).
  1. **Sum and Product Inequality**: We use the fact that the sum of the sequence equals \(n\) and apply the AM-GM inequality to the product of the sequence.
  2. **Non-negativity and Sum Constraint**: The non-negativity of the sequence and the sum constraint ensure that the terms are well-defined and the sum is correctly computed.
  3. **Applying AM-GM Inequality**: The AM-GM inequality states that for any non-negative numbers \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\), \(\frac{x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n}{n} \geq \sqrt[n]{x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n}\). Here, the product of the sequence is bounded by the sum of the sequence, which simplifies to \(n\).
  4. **Conclusion**: Given the constraints and the AM-GM inequality, the product of the sequence must be less than or equal to 1.
