  Given a sequence of nonnegative real numbers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) such that \(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = n\), we need to show that \(\prod_{i=1}^n a_i \leq 1\).
  1. **Base Case (n = 0):** When \(n = 0\), the sum \(\sum_{i=1}^0 a_i = 0\), which trivially satisfies the condition. The product \(\prod_{i=1}^0 a_i\) is also defined to be 1, which is trivially less than or equal to 1.
  2. **Inductive Step:** Assume the statement holds for \(n\). We need to show it holds for \(n + 1\).
     - The sum of the sequence for \(n + 1\) is \(\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} a_i = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i + a_{n+1}\). Given that \(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = n\), we have \(\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} a_i = n + a_{n+1}\).
     - By the inductive hypothesis, \(\prod_{i=1}^n a_i \leq 1\).
     - Using the fact that \(a_{n+1}\) is nonnegative and the sum constraint \(n + a_{n+1} = n\), we can deduce that \(a_{n+1} = 0\) to satisfy the sum condition.
     - Therefore, \(\prod_{i=1}^{n+1} a_i = \prod_{i=1}^n a_i \cdot a_{n+1} = 1 \cdot 0 = 0\), which is trivially less than or equal to 1.
  By induction, the statement holds for all \(n\).

    -- Given the sum constraint, the nth term must be 0 to satisfy the sum condition.
