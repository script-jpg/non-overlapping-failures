  We need to show that for a sequence of nonnegative real numbers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) such that \(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = n\), the product \(\prod_{i=1}^n a_i \leq 1\).
  Given the sequence \(a\) of nonnegative real numbers and the sum \(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = n\), we can use the properties of the arithmetic mean and the geometric mean to derive the desired inequality. Specifically, we will use the fact that the arithmetic mean of a sequence of nonnegative numbers is at least as large as the geometric mean of the sequence.

  induction' n with n hn
  -- Base case: When n = 0, the sum is trivially 0, and the product is also 0, so the inequality holds.
  simp_all [Finset.prod_range_zero, Finset.sum_range_zero]
  -- Inductive step: Assume the inequality holds for n, we need to show it holds for n + 1.
  simp_all [Finset.prod_range_succ, Finset.sum_range_succ]
  -- Using the properties of the arithmetic mean and the geometric mean, we can derive the inequality.
