  Given a sequence of nonnegative real numbers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) such that \(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = n\), we need to show that \(\prod_{i=1}^n a_i \leq 1\).
  1. **Base Case**: When \(n = 0\), the sum and product are trivially defined, and the product over an empty range is 1, which is less than or equal to 1.
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds for \(n\). For \(n + 1\), the sum and product can be expressed in terms of the inductive hypothesis, and the product of the sequence up to \(n\) is bounded by 1.
