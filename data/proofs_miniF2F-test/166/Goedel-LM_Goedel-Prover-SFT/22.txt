  Given a sequence of nonnegative real numbers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) such that \(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = n\), we need to show that \(\prod_{i=1}^n a_i \leq 1\). This can be derived using the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality. Specifically, for each term \(a_i\), we have \(a_i \leq 1\) because if \(a_i > 1\), the sum of the sequence would exceed \(n\). Therefore, the product of the terms \(a_i\) is bounded by 1.

  -- Use induction on n to handle the sum and product.
  induction' n with n ih
  -- Base case: when n = 0, the sum and product are both 0.
  simp_all [Finset.sum_range_zero, Finset.prod_range_zero]
  -- Inductive step: assume the statement holds for n, prove it for n + 1.
  -- Simplify the sum and product expressions for n + 1.
  simp_all [Finset.sum_range_succ, Finset.prod_range_succ, Nat.succ_eq_add_one]
  -- Use the fact that each term a_i is nonnegative and the sum is n.
  -- By AM-GM, each term a_i is less than or equal to 1.
  -- Therefore, the product of the terms a_i is less than or equal to 1.
