  Given a sequence of nonnegative real numbers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) such that \(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = n\), we aim to show that \(\prod_{i=1}^n a_i \leq 1\).
  1. **Base Case**: When \(n = 0\), the product \(\prod_{i=0}^0 a_i\) is trivially \(1\).
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds for a sequence of length \(n\). Consider a sequence of length \(n+1\). The product of the sequence can be expressed as \(\prod_{i=0}^{n+1} a_i = \prod_{i=0}^n a_i \cdot a_{n+1}\). By the inductive hypothesis, \(\prod_{i=0}^n a_i \leq 1\). Since \(a_{n+1}\) is nonnegative and the sum of the sequence remains \(n+1\), the product \(\prod_{i=0}^{n+1} a_i\) is bounded by \(\prod_{i=0}^n a_i \cdot a_{n+1} \leq 1 \cdot a_{n+1} = a_{n+1}\). Given that \(a_{n+1}\) is nonnegative and the sum of the sequence is \(n+1\), \(a_{n+1}\) must be less than or equal to 1.
  Thus, by induction, the product of any sequence of nonnegative real numbers summing to \(n\) is less than or equal to 1.
