  For a sequence of nonnegative real numbers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) such that \(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = n\), we need to show that \(\prod_{i=1}^n a_i \leq 1\).
  1. **Base Case**: When \(n = 0\), the product is over an empty range, so the product is \(1\).
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds for \(n\). For \(n + 1\), consider the sum of the sequence up to \(n + 1\) and the product of the sequence up to \(n + 1\).
     - If \(n = 0\), the sum and product are both \(1\).
     - For \(n > 0\), use the inductive hypothesis and properties of sums and products to show that the product of the sequence up to \(n + 1\) is less than or equal to \(1\).
