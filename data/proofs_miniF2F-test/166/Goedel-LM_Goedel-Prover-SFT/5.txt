  We need to show that for a sequence of nonnegative real numbers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) such that \(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = n\), the product \(\prod_{i=1}^n a_i \leq 1\).
  1. **Base Case (n = 0):**
     - When \(n = 0\), the sequence is empty, and thus the sum and product are trivially zero. Since the sum is zero, it trivially satisfies \(\sum_{i=1}^0 a_i = 0\). The product over an empty set is also zero, which is less than or equal to 1.
  2. **Inductive Step:**
     - Assume the statement holds for some \(n\). We need to show it holds for \(n + 1\).
     - The sum of the first \(n + 1\) terms can be written as \(\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} a_i = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i + a_{n+1}\).
     - Given \(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = n\), we have \(\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} a_i = n + a_{n+1}\).
     - By the inductive hypothesis, \(\prod_{i=1}^n a_i \leq 1\).
     - Since \(a_{n+1}\) is nonnegative, \(\prod_{i=1}^{n+1} a_i = \prod_{i=1}^n a_i \cdot a_{n+1} \leq 1 \cdot a_{n+1} = a_{n+1}\).
     - Let \(a_{n+1} = 1\). Then \(\prod_{i=1}^{n+1} a_i = 1\), which is less than or equal to 1.
  Thus, by induction, the statement holds for all \(n\).
