  We need to show that for a sequence of nonnegative real numbers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) such that \(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = n\), the product \(\prod_{i=1}^n a_i \leq 1\).
  1. **Base Case (n = 0):**
     - The sum \(\sum_{i=1}^0 a_i = 0\), which matches the given condition.
     - The product \(\prod_{i=1}^0 a_i = 1\), which is trivially less than or equal to 1.
  2. **Inductive Step:**
     - Assume the statement holds for \(n\).
     - For \(n + 1\), the sum \(\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} a_i = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i + a_{n+1} = n + a_{n+1}\).
     - By the inductive hypothesis, \(\prod_{i=1}^n a_i \leq 1\).
     - Since \(a_{n+1}\) is nonnegative, the product \(\prod_{i=1}^{n+1} a_i = \prod_{i=1}^n a_i \cdot a_{n+1} \leq 1 \cdot a_{n+1} = a_{n+1}\).
     - Given that \(a_{n+1}\) is nonnegative and the sum \(\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} a_i = n + a_{n+1}\), we need to show that \(a_{n+1} \leq 1\).
     - If \(a_{n+1} > 1\), then \(\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} a_i > n + 1\), which contradicts the given condition \(\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} a_i = n + a_{n+1}\).
     - Therefore, \(a_{n+1} \leq 1\).
  By induction, the product \(\prod_{i=1}^n a_i \leq 1\) for all \(n\).
