  Given a sequence of nonnegative real numbers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) such that \(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = n\), we aim to show that \(\prod_{i=1}^n a_i \leq 1\).
  1. **Base Case (n = 0):**
     - If \(n = 0\), the product \(\prod_{i=1}^n a_i\) is trivially zero, which is less than or equal to 1.
  2. **Inductive Step:**
     - Assume the statement holds for \(n\), i.e., \(\prod_{i=1}^n a_i \leq 1\).
     - For \(n+1\), consider the product \(\prod_{i=1}^{n+1} a_i = \prod_{i=1}^n a_i \cdot a_{n+1}\).
     - By the inductive hypothesis, \(\prod_{i=1}^n a_i \leq 1\).
     - Since \(a_{n+1}\) is nonnegative and the sum \(\sum_{i=1}^{n+1} a_i = n + a_{n+1} = n\), it follows that \(a_{n+1} \leq 1\).
     - Therefore, \(\prod_{i=1}^n a_i \cdot a_{n+1} \leq 1 \cdot 1 = 1\).
  Thus, by induction, \(\prod_{i=1}^n a_i \leq 1\) for all \(n\).

  -- Using the inductive hypothesis and the fact that a_{n+1} is nonnegative and the sum constraint,
  -- we can conclude that the product for n+1 is less than or equal to 1.
