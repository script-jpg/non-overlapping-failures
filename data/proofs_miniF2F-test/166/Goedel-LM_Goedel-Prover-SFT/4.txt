  We need to show that for a sequence of nonnegative real numbers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) such that \(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = n\), the product \(\prod_{i=1}^n a_i\) is at most 1. This can be achieved by leveraging the properties of the arithmetic mean-geometric mean inequality (AM-GM inequality) and the fact that the sum of the sequence equals \(n\).
  1. **Non-negativity and Sum Constraint**: Given \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) are nonnegative real numbers and \(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = n\), we can use the AM-GM inequality to relate the sum and the product of the terms.
  2. **AM-GM Inequality Application**: By the AM-GM inequality, for any nonnegative real numbers \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\), we have:
     \[
     \frac{x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n}{n} \geq \sqrt[n]{x_1 x_2 \cdots x_n}
     \]
     Applying this to our sequence, we get:
     \[
     \frac{a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n}{n} \geq \sqrt[n]{a_1 a_2 \cdots a_n}
     \]
     Simplifying the right-hand side, we have:
     \[
     \sqrt[n]{a_1 a_2 \cdots a_n} = \prod_{i=1}^n a_i
     \]
     Given \(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = n\), we can infer that:
     \[
     \prod_{i=1}^n a_i \leq 1
     \]
  3. **Conclusion**: By the properties of the AM-GM inequality and the fact that the sum of the sequence equals \(n\), we conclude that \(\prod_{i=1}^n a_i \leq 1\).
