  Given a sequence of nonnegative real numbers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) such that the sum \( \sum_{i=1}^n a_i = n \), we aim to show that the product \( \prod_{i=1}^n a_i \leq 1 \).
  1. **Sum and Product Inequalities**: We use the fact that the sum of the sequence is \( n \) and apply basic algebraic inequalities to bound the product.
  2. **Non-negativity and Bounds**: By leveraging the non-negativity of the sequence and the given sum constraint, we can derive the desired inequality.

  -- Contradiction arises from the fact that the product of the sequence cannot be greater than 1 if the sum is n.
