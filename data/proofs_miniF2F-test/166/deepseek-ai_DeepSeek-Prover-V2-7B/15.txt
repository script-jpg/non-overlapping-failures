/-- For a sequence of nonnegative real numbers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = n$, show that $\prod_{i=1}^n a_i \leq 1$.

This can be proven using the AM-GM inequality by showing that the arithmetic mean of the sequence is at least the geometric mean, leading to the conclusion that the geometric mean is at most 1.

### Key Ideas:
1. **Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean Inequality (AM-GM)**: For any finite set of nonnegative real numbers, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean.
2. **Given Condition**: The sum of the sequence is \( n \), i.e., \(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = n\).
3. **Applying AM-GM**:
   - The arithmetic mean of the sequence is \(\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n a_i}{n} = 1\).
   - By AM-GM, the geometric mean is bounded by the arithmetic mean, i.e., the geometric mean is at most 1.
4. **Conclusion**: Since the geometric mean is at most 1, the product \(\prod_{i=1}^n a_i\) is at most 1.

### Proof Summary:
1. Use the AM-GM inequality to relate the arithmetic and geometric means of the sequence \(a_i\).
2. The arithmetic mean of the sequence is 1, as the sum is \( n \).
3. By AM-GM, the geometric mean is at most the arithmetic mean, which is 1.
4. Therefore, the product of the sequence is at most 1.
