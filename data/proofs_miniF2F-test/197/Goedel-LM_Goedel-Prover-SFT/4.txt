  Given two different positive numbers \(a\) and \(b\) each differing from their reciprocals by 1, we need to show that \(a + b = \sqrt{5}\).
  1. Start by noting that since \(a\) and \(b\) are positive, \(a \cdot b\) is also positive.
  2. Use the given conditions \(|a - \frac{1}{a}| = 1\) and \(|b - \frac{1}{b}| = 1\) to derive equations involving \(a\) and \(b\).
  3. Simplify these equations to find the values of \(a\) and \(b\).
  4. Use algebraic manipulation and the properties of real numbers to conclude that \(a + b = \sqrt{5}\).
