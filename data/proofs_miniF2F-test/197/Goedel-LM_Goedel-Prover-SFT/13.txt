  Given two different positive numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that each differs from their reciprocals by 1, we need to show that \(a + b = \sqrt{5}\).
  1. Start by simplifying the given conditions using the properties of absolute values.
  2. Use the fact that \(a\) and \(b\) are positive and different from their reciprocals to derive equations involving \(a\) and \(b\).
  3. Solve these equations to find the values of \(a\) and \(b\).
  4. Verify that the sum \(a + b\) equals \(\sqrt{5}\).
