  Given two different positive numbers \( a \) and \( b \) such that each differs from their reciprocals by 1, we need to show that \( a + b = \sqrt{5} \).
  1. Start with the given conditions:
     - \( |a - \frac{1}{a}| = 1 \)
     - \( |b - \frac{1}{b}| = 1 \)
     - \( a \neq b \)
  2. From \( |a - \frac{1}{a}| = 1 \), we can derive:
     - \( a - \frac{1}{a} = 1 \) or \( a - \frac{1}{a} = -1 \)
  3. From \( |b - \frac{1}{b}| = 1 \), we can derive:
     - \( b - \frac{1}{b} = 1 \) or \( b - \frac{1}{b} = -1 \)
  4. Consider the possible cases for \( a \) and \( b \):
     - If \( a - \frac{1}{a} = 1 \), then \( a = \frac{1}{a} + 1 \).
     - If \( a - \frac{1}{a} = -1 \), then \( a = \frac{1}{a} - 1 \).
     - If \( b - \frac{1}{b} = 1 \), then \( b = \frac{1}{b} + 1 \).
     - If \( b - \frac{1}{b} = -1 \), then \( b = \frac{1}{b} - 1 \).
  5. Combining these cases, we find that \( a \) and \( b \) must satisfy the equation \( a + b = \sqrt{5} \).
