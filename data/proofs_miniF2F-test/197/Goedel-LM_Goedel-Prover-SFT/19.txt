  Given two different positive numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that each differs from their reciprocals by 1, we need to show that \(a + b = \sqrt{5}\).
  1. Start by considering the equation \(|a - \frac{1}{a}| = 1\).
  2. Since \(a\) is positive, we can write \(a - \frac{1}{a} = 1\) or \(a - \frac{1}{a} = -1\).
  3. Similarly, for \(b\), we have \(|b - \frac{1}{b}| = 1\), which implies \(b - \frac{1}{b} = 1\) or \(b - \frac{1}{b} = -1\).
  4. We need to solve these equations to find \(a\) and \(b\).
  5. By solving the equations, we find that \(a = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\) and \(b = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}\).
  6. Adding these values, we get \(a + b = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} + \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \sqrt{5}\).
