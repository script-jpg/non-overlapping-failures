  Given two different positive numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that each differs from their reciprocals by 1, we need to show that \(a + b = \sqrt{5}\).
  1. From the given conditions, we have:
     \[
     |a - \frac{1}{a}| = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad |b - \frac{1}{b}| = 1
     \]
  2. This implies:
     \[
     a - \frac{1}{a} = 1 \quad \text{or} \quad a - \frac{1}{a} = -1
     \]
     and similarly for \(b\).
  3. Solving these equations, we find:
     \[
     a = \frac{1}{a} + 1 \quad \text{or} \quad a = \frac{1}{a} - 1
     \]
     which simplifies to:
     \[
     a^2 - a - 1 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad a^2 - a + 1 = 0
     \]
  4. Similarly, for \(b\):
     \[
     b = \frac{1}{b} + 1 \quad \text{or} \quad b = \frac{1}{b} - 1
     \]
     which simplifies to:
     \[
     b^2 - b - 1 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad b^2 - b + 1 = 0
     \]
  5. Since \(a\) and \(b\) are positive and different, we solve the quadratic equations:
     \[
     a^2 - a - 1 = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad b^2 - b - 1 = 0
     \]
  6. The solutions to these equations are:
     \[
     a = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad b = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}
     \]
     or
     \[
     a = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad b = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}
     \]
  7. Since \(a \neq b\), we have:
     \[
     a = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad b = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}
     \]
  8. Therefore, \(a + b\) is:
     \[
     a + b = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} + \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \sqrt{5}
     \]
