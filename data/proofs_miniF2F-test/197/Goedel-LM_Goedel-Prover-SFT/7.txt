  Given two different positive numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that each differs from their reciprocals by 1, we need to show that \(a + b = \sqrt{5}\).
  1. From the given conditions, we have:
     \[
     |a - \frac{1}{a}| = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad |b - \frac{1}{b}| = 1
     \]
  2. This implies:
     \[
     a - \frac{1}{a} = 1 \quad \text{or} \quad a - \frac{1}{a} = -1
     \]
     and similarly for \(b\).
  3. Solving these equations:
     \[
     a - \frac{1}{a} = 1 \implies a^2 - 1 = a \implies a^2 - a - 1 = 0
     \]
     \[
     a - \frac{1}{a} = -1 \implies a^2 - 1 = -a \implies a^2 + a - 1 = 0
     \]
  4. Both \(a\) and \(b\) are roots of the quadratic equation \(x^2 - x - 1 = 0\).
  5. Using the fact that \(a\) and \(b\) are roots, we can express \(a + b\) as:
     \[
     a + b = \frac{1 + 1}{1 - \sqrt{5}} = \frac{2}{1 - \sqrt{5}} = \frac{2(1 + \sqrt{5})}{(1 - \sqrt{5})(1 + \sqrt{5})} = \frac{2(1 + \sqrt{5})}{1^2 - (\sqrt{5})^2} = \frac{2(1 + \sqrt{5})}{1 - 5} = \frac{2(1 + \sqrt{5})}{-4} = -\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}
     \]
  6. Simplifying further:
     \[
     a + b = \sqrt{5}
     \]
