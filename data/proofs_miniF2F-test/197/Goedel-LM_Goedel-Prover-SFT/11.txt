  Given two different positive numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that each differs from their reciprocals by 1, we need to show that \(a + b = \sqrt{5}\).
  1. Start by simplifying the given conditions using the properties of absolute values.
  2. Consider the cases where \(a - 1/a\) and \(b - 1/b\) are either non-negative or negative.
  3. Use the fact that the absolute values of these expressions are 1 to derive equations involving \(a\) and \(b\).
  4. Solve these equations to find the values of \(a\) and \(b\).
  5. Verify that the sum \(a + b\) equals \(\sqrt{5}\).
