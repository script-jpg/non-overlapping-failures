  Given two different positive numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that each differs from their reciprocals by 1, we need to show that \(a + b = \sqrt{5}\).
  1. From the given conditions, we have:
     \[
     |a - \frac{1}{a}| = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad |b - \frac{1}{b}| = 1
     \]
  2. Since \(a\) and \(b\) are positive, we can express the absolute values as:
     \[
     a - \frac{1}{a} = \pm 1 \quad \text{and} \quad b - \frac{1}{b} = \pm 1
     \]
  3. We need to solve for \(a\) and \(b\) such that:
     \[
     a - \frac{1}{a} = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad b - \frac{1}{b} = 1
     \]
  4. Solving these equations, we find:
     \[
     a = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad b = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}
     \]
  5. Adding these solutions, we get:
     \[
     a + b = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} + \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \sqrt{5}
     \]
