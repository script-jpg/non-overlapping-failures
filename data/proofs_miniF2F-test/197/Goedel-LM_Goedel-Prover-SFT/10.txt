  Given two different positive numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that each differs from its reciprocal by 1, we need to find \(a + b\).
  1. From the given conditions, we have:
     \[
     |a - \frac{1}{a}| = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad |b - \frac{1}{b}| = 1
     \]
  2. We can express \(a\) and \(b\) in terms of their reciprocals:
     \[
     a = \frac{1}{a} + 1 \quad \text{and} \quad b = \frac{1}{b} + 1
     \]
  3. Similarly, we can express \(a\) and \(b\) in terms of their reciprocals:
     \[
     a = \frac{1}{a} + 1 \quad \text{and} \quad b = \frac{1}{b} + 1
     \]
  4. Using the fact that \(a\) and \(b\) are positive, we can solve for \(a\) and \(b\) by considering the absolute values and the given conditions.
  5. By solving the equations and using the properties of absolute values, we find that \(a + b = \sqrt{5}\).
