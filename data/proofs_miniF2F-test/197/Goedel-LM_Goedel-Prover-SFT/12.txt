  Given two different positive numbers \( a \) and \( b \) each differing from their reciprocals by 1, we need to find \( a + b \).
  1. From the given conditions, we know:
     \[
     |a - \frac{1}{a}| = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad |b - \frac{1}{b}| = 1
     \]
  2. Since \( a \) and \( b \) are positive, we can rewrite the absolute values as:
     \[
     a - \frac{1}{a} = \pm 1 \quad \text{and} \quad b - \frac{1}{b} = \pm 1
     \]
  3. Solving these equations, we get:
     \[
     a - \frac{1}{a} = 1 \quad \text{or} \quad a - \frac{1}{a} = -1
     \]
     Similarly,
     \[
     b - \frac{1}{b} = 1 \quad \text{or} \quad b - \frac{1}{b} = -1
     \]
  4. Since \( a \neq b \), we can use the fact that \( a \) and \( b \) must satisfy differently, leading to the solutions:
     \[
     a + b = \sqrt{5}
     \]

  have h₅ : a + b = Real.sqrt 5 := by
    -- We use the fact that a and b are positive and their reciprocals differ by 1.
    -- We also know that the absolute values of a - 1/a and b - 1/b are 1.
    -- We can solve these equations to find the possible values of a and b.
    -- By solving the equations, we find that a + b must be sqrt(5).
