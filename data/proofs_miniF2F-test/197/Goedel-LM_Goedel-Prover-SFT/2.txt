  Given two different positive numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that each differs from their reciprocals by 1, we need to show that \(a + b = \sqrt{5}\).
  1. From the given conditions, we have:
     \[
     |a - \frac{1}{a}| = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad |b - \frac{1}{b}| = 1
     \]
  2. This implies:
     \[
     a - \frac{1}{a} = 1 \quad \text{or} \quad a - \frac{1}{a} = -1
     \]
     and similarly for \(b\).
  3. Solving these equations, we get:
     \[
     a = \frac{1}{a} + 1 \quad \text{or} \quad a = \frac{1}{a} - 1
     \]
     and similarly for \(b\).
  4. By solving these equations, we find:
     \[
     a = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad b = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}
     \]
  5. Adding these values, we get:
     \[
     a + b = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} + \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = 1
     \]
  6. However, this contradicts the initial condition that \(a\) and \(b\) are positive and distinct. Therefore, we must have made an error in our assumptions or calculations.
