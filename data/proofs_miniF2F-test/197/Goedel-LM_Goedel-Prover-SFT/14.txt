  Given two different positive numbers \( a \) and \( b \), each differs from their reciprocals by 1. We need to show that \( a + b = \sqrt{5} \).
  1. From the given conditions, we have:
     \[
     |a - \frac{1}{a}| = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad |b - \frac{1}{b}| = 1
     \]
  2. Since \( a \) and \( b \) are positive, we can express the absolute value equations as:
     \[
     a - \frac{1}{a} = 1 \quad \text{or} \quad a - \frac{1}{a} = -1
     \]
     and similarly for \( b \).
  3. Solving these equations, we find:
     \[
     a = \frac{1 + 1}{2} = 1 \quad \text{or} \quad a = \frac{1 - 1}{2} = 0
     \]
     Since \( a \) is positive, \( a = 1 \).
  4. Similarly, for \( b \):
     \[
     b = \frac{1 + 1}{2} = 1 \quad \text{or} \quad b = \frac{1 - 1}{2} = 0
     \]
     Since \( b \) is positive, \( b = 1 \).
  5. Therefore, \( a + b = 1 + 1 = 2 \).
  However, this contradicts the given condition that \( a + b = \sqrt{5} \). Therefore, we must have made an error in our initial assumptions or calculations.
