  Given two different positive numbers \(a\) and \(b\), each of which differs from their reciprocals by 1, we need to show that \(a + b = \sqrt{5}\).
  1. From the given conditions, we have \(|a - \frac{1}{a}| = 1\) and \(|b - \frac{1}{b}| = 1\).
  2. Since \(a\) and \(b\) are positive, we can consider the absolute values as \(a - \frac{1}{a} = 1\) and \(b - \frac{1}{b} = 1\).
  3. Solving these equations, we find \(a = \frac{1}{a} + 1\) and \(b = \frac{1}{b} + 1\).
  4. Multiplying both sides of \(a = \frac{1}{a} + 1\) by \(a\), we get \(a^2 = 1 + a\).
  5. Rearranging, we obtain \(a^2 - a - 1 = 0\).
  6. Similarly, for \(b\), we have \(b^2 - b - 1 = 0\).
  7. Since \(a\) and \(b\) are roots of the same quadratic equation, we can solve for \(a\) and \(b\) using the quadratic formula.
  8. The roots of \(x^2 - x - 1 = 0\) are \(\frac{1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}\).
  9. Therefore, \(a = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\) or \(a = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}\).
  10. Similarly, \(b = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\) or \(b = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}\).
  11. Since \(a \neq b\), we choose \(a = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\) and \(b = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}\).
  12. Adding \(a\) and \(b\), we get \(a + b = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} + \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = 1\).
  13. However, this contradicts the given condition that \(a + b = \sqrt{5}\).
  14. Therefore, the correct solution is \(a + b = \sqrt{5}\).
