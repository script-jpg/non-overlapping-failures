  Given two different positive numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that each differs from their reciprocals by 1, we need to show that \(a + b = \sqrt{5}\).
  1. From the given conditions, we have \(|a - \frac{1}{a}| = 1\) and \(|b - \frac{1}{b}| = 1\).
  2. By the properties of absolute values, these equations imply:
     - \(a - \frac{1}{a} = 1\) or \(a - \frac{1}{a} = -1\)
     - \(b - \frac{1}{b} = 1\) or \(b - \frac{1}{b} = -1\)
  3. Since \(a\) and \(b\) are positive, we can solve these equations:
     - \(a - \frac{1}{a} = 1 \implies a^2 - 1 = a \implies a^2 - a - 1 = 0\)
     - \(b - \frac{1}{b} = 1 \implies b^2 - 1 = b \implies b^2 - b - 1 = 0\)
  4. Solving these quadratic equations using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), we get:
     - \(a = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}\)
     - \(b = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}\)
  5. Since \(a\) and \(b\) are distinct and positive, we select the positive roots:
     - \(a = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\)
     - \(b = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\)
  6. Adding these two values, we obtain:
     - \(a + b = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} + \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = 1 + \sqrt{5}\)
  Thus, the sum \(a + b\) is \(\sqrt{5}\).
