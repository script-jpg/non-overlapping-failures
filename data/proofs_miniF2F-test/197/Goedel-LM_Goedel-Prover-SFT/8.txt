  Given two different positive numbers \(a\) and \(b\), each of which differs from its reciprocal by 1, we need to show that \(a + b = \sqrt{5}\).
  1. Since \(a\) and \(b\) are positive, we can use the given conditions to set up equations involving \(a\) and \(b\).
  2. The condition \(|a - \frac{1}{a}| = 1\) implies that \(a - \frac{1}{a} = \pm 1\).
  3. Similarly, the condition \(|b - \frac{1}{b}| = 1\) implies that \(b - \frac{1}{b} = \pm 1\).
  4. We solve these equations to find the values of \(a\) and \(b\).
  5. By solving the equations, we find that \(a = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\) and \(b = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}\).
  6. Adding these values, we get \(a + b = \sqrt{5}\).
