-- We have $a>0$, $b>0$, and both $a$ and $b$ differ from their reciprocals by 1.
  -- We want to show that $a + b = \sqrt{5}$.

  -- Let's first consider the equation $x - 1/x = 1$.
  -- Multiplying both sides by $x$ (which is positive) gives $x^2 - 1 = x$.
  -- Rearrange to get $x^2 - x - 1 = 0$.
  -- Similarly, the equation $x - 1/x = -1$ can be rewritten as $x^2 + x - 1 = 0$.

  -- Let's analyze the solutions of $x^2 - x - 1 = 0$.
  -- The discriminant is $1 + 4 = 5$.
  -- The solutions are $x = (1 \pm \sqrt{5}) / 2$.
  -- Only the positive solution is valid since $x>0$.
  -- Thus $x = (1 + \sqrt{5}) / 2$.

  -- Now consider $x^2 + x - 1 = 0$.
  -- The discriminant is $1 + 4 = 5$.
  -- The solutions are $x = (-1 \pm \sqrt{5}) / 2$.
  -- Only the positive solution is valid since $x>0$.
  -- Thus $x = (-1 + \sqrt{5}) / 2$.

  -- So there are two positive numbers that differ from their reciprocals by 1:
  -- $(1 + \sqrt{5}) / 2$ and $(-1 + \sqrt{5}) / 2$.
  -- Their sum is $(1 + \sqrt{5}) / 2 + (-1 + \sqrt{5}) / 2 = \sqrt{5}$.
