  -- We're still not done. Let's try a different approach.
  -- We have: `(y^2 - 10) * (y^2 - 3 * x^2 - 11) = -417`
  -- Let's consider the possible values for `y^2 - 10` and `y^2 - 3 * x^2 - 11` that multiply to -417.
  -- Since y^2 ≥ 0, y^2 - 10 ≥ -10, so we only need to consider values of y^2 - 10 in the range [-10, 417].
  -- For each possible value of y^2 - 10, we can solve for x^2 and check if it's an integer.

  -- For example:
  -- If y^2 - 10 = -1, then y^2 = 9, and we have -1 * (9 - 3 * x^2 - 11) = -417
  -- This gives us -(9 - 3 * x^2 - 11) = -417, or 9 - 3 * x^2 - 11 = 417
  -- Simplifying: -3 * x^2 - 2 = 417, -3 * x^2 = 419, x^2 = -419/3, which is not an integer.

  -- If y^2 - 10 = 1, then y^2 = 11, and we have 1 * (11 - 3 * x^2 - 11) = -417
  -- This gives us 11 - 3 * x^2 - 11 = -417, or -3 * x^2 = -417
  -- Simplifying: x^2 = 139, which is not a perfect square.

  -- Continuing in this way, we'll eventually find that the only valid integer solutions are:
  -- (y^2 - 10, y^2 - 3 * x^2 - 11) = (-1, 417), (3, -139), (7, -61), (19, -21), (21, 19), (61, -7), (139, -3), (417, -1)
  -- But only (-1, 417) and (417, -1) give us integer values for x^2.

  -- For (y^2 - 10, y^2 - 3 * x^2 - 11) = (-1, 417):
  -- y^2 - 10 = -1 → y^2 = 9 → y = ±3
  -- y^2 - 3 * x^2 - 11 = 417 → 9 - 3 * x^2 - 11 = 417 → -3 * x^2 - 2 = 417 → -3 * x^2 = 419 → x^2 = -419/3
  -- This doesn't give us an integer value for x^2.

  -- For (y^2 - 10, y^2 - 3 * x^2 - 11) = (417, -1):
  -- y^2 - 10 = 417 → y^2 = 427 → y = ±√427 (not an integer)
  -- y^2 - 3 * x^2 - 11 = -1 → 427 - 3 * x^2 - 11 = -1 → 416 - 3 * x^2 = -1 → 3 * x^2 = 417 → x^2 = 139
  -- This doesn't give us an integer value for x^2.

  -- After checking all possible values, we find that there are no integer values for x and y that satisfy our equation.
  -- This means there must be an error in the problem statement, or our approach is incorrect.

  -- Let's double-check our work.
  -- We started with: `y^2 + 3 * (x^2 * y^2) = 30 * x^2 + 517`
  -- Rearranged to: `3 * (x^2 * y^2) = 30 * x^2 + 517 - y^2`
  -- This seems correct, as it's a direct rearrangement of the original equation.

  -- Let's try a different approach.
  -- We can try to find integer values for x and y by testing small values.
  -- For example, if x = 0, then:
  -- `y^2 + 3 * (0^2 * y^2) = 30 * 0^2 + 517`
  -- `y^2 = 517`
  -- y^2 = 517 isn't a perfect square, so there's no integer y that satisfies this when x = 0.

  -- If x = 1, then:
  -- `y^2 + 3 * (1^2 * y^2) = 30 * 1^2 + 517`
  -- `y^2 + 3 * y^2 = 30 + 517`
  -- `4 * y^2 = 547`
  -- y^2 = 547/4 isn't an integer, so there's no integer y that satisfies this when x = 1.

  -- If x = 2, then:
  -- `y^2 + 3 * (2^2 * y^2) = 30 * 2^2 + 517`
  -- `y^2 + 3 * (4 * y^2) = 120 + 517`
  -- `y^2 + 12 * y^2 = 637`
  -- `13 * y^2 = 637`
  -- y^2 = 637/13 = 49
  -- y = ±7, which are integers!

  -- So we have a solution: x = 2, y = ±7
  -- Let's verify:
  -- y^2 + 3 * (x^2 * y^2) = 49 + 3 * (4 * 49) = 49 + 3 * 196 = 49 + 588 = 637
  -- 30 * x^2 + 517 = 30 * 4 + 517 = 120 + 517 = 637
  -- This checks out!

  -- Now, let's compute 3 * (x^2 * y^2):
  -- 3 * (2^2 * 7^2) = 3 * (4 * 49) = 3 * 196 = 588

  -- We should verify that this is the only solution.
  -- If x = 3, then:
  -- `y^2 + 3 * (3^2 * y^2) = 30 * 3^2 + 517`
  -- `y^2 + 3 * (9 * y^2) = 270 +
