  Given integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( y^2 + 3x^2 y^2 = 30x^2 + 517 \), we need to show that \( 3x^2 y^2 = 588 \).
  1. Start by rewriting the given equation \( y^2 + 3x^2 y^2 = 30x^2 + 517 \).
  2. Rearrange the equation to isolate the terms involving \( x \) and \( y \).
  3. Use algebraic manipulation to express \( 3x^2 y^2 \) in terms of the given equation.
  4. Verify that the resulting expression matches the required value of 588.
