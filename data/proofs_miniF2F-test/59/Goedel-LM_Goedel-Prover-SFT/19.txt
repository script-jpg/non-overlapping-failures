  Given integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( y^2 + 3x^2 y^2 = 30x^2 + 517 \), we need to find \( 3x^2 y^2 \) and show that it equals 588.
  1. Start by isolating \( 3x^2 y^2 \) on one side of the equation.
  2. Use the given equation to express \( 3x^2 y^2 \) in terms of the other terms.
  3. Simplify the equation to find the value of \( 3x^2 y^2 \).

  -- We need to show that 3 * (x ^ 2 * y ^ 2) = 588.
  have h₁ : 3 * (x ^ 2 * y ^ 2) = 588 := by
    -- Use the given equation to express 3 * (x ^ 2 * y ^ 2) in terms of the other terms.
    -- Simplify the equation to find the value of 3 * (x ^ 2 * y ^ 2).
    nlinarith [sq_nonneg (x * y), h₀, sq_nonneg (x * y - 1), sq_nonneg (x * y + 1),
      sq_nonneg (x * y - 2), sq_nonneg (x * y + 2)]
  -- The result h₁ directly gives us the desired equality.
