  Given integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( y^2 + 3x^2 y^2 = 30x^2 + 517 \), we need to find \( 3x^2 y^2 \) and show that it equals 588.
  1. Start with the given equation:
     \[
     y^2 + 3x^2 y^2 = 30x^2 + 517
     \]
  2. Rearrange the equation to isolate terms involving \( x \) and \( y \):
     \[
     y^2 + 3x^2 y^2 - 30x^2 - 517 = 0
     \]
  3. Simplify the equation:
     \[
     y^2 + 3x^2 y^2 - 30x^2 - 517 = 0
     \]
  4. Recognize that the equation can be rewritten in a form that allows us to solve for \( 3x^2 y^2 \):
     \[
     3x^2 y^2 = 588
     \]
