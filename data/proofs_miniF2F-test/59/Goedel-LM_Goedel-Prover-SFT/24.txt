  Given integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( y^2 + 3x^2 y^2 = 30x^2 + 517 \), we need to show that \( 3x^2 y^2 = 588 \).
  1. Start by isolating the term \( 3x^2 y^2 \) in the given equation.
  2. Rearrange the equation to express \( 3x^2 y^2 \) on one side.
  3. Use the fact that the equation must hold for integer values of \( x \) and \( y \) to solve for \( 3x^2 y^2 \).
  4. Verify that the only integer solution that satisfies the equation is \( 3x^2 y^2 = 588 \).
