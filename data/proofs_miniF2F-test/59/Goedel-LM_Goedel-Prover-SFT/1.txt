  Given integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( y^2 + 3x^2 y^2 = 30x^2 + 517 \), we need to show that \( 3x^2 y^2 = 588 \).
  1. Start by isolating the terms involving \( x \) and \( y \) on one side of the equation.
  2. Use algebraic manipulation to simplify the equation.
  3. Use the properties of integers and arithmetic operations to derive the desired result.
