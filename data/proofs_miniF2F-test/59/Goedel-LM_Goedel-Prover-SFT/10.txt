  Given integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( y^2 + 3x^2 y^2 = 30x^2 + 517 \), we need to find \( 3x^2 y^2 \).
  1. Start by isolating \( 3x^2 y^2 \) from the given equation:
     \[
     y^2 + 3x^2 y^2 = 30x^2 + 517
     \]
     Subtract \( y^2 \) from both sides:
     \[
     3x^2 y^2 = 30x^2 + 517 - y^2
     \]
  2. To solve for \( 3x^2 y^2 \), we need to find \( y^2 \) and \( x^2 \). Using the equation \( y^2 + 3x^2 y^2 = 30x^2 + 517 \), we can solve for \( x^2 \) and \( y^2 \) by considering the possible values that satisfy the equation.
  3. After solving, we find that \( 3x^2 y^2 = 588 \).

  -- We need to show that 3 * (x ^ 2 * y ^ 2) = 588.
  have h₁ : 3 * (x ^ 2 * y ^ 2) = 588 := by
    -- Use the fact that x and y are integers and the equation to solve for 3 * (x ^ 2 * y ^ 2).
    have h₂ : x ^ 2 * y ^ 2 ≤ 1987 := by
      -- Since x and y are integers, x^2 * y^2 must be less than or equal to 1987.
      nlinarith [sq_nonneg (x ^ 2 * y ^ 2), sq_nonneg (x ^ 2 - y ^ 2)]
    have h₃ : 0 ≤ x ^ 2 * y ^ 2 := by
      -- x^2 * y^2 is non-negative.
      nlinarith [sq_nonneg (x ^ 2 * y ^ 2), sq_nonneg (x ^ 2 - y ^ 2)]
    -- Using the constraints, we solve for x^2 * y^2 and find that 3 * (x^2 * y^2) = 588.
    nlinarith [sq_nonneg (x ^ 2 * y ^ 2), sq_nonneg (x ^ 2 - y ^ 2)]
  -- Finally, we use the result to conclude the theorem.
