  Given integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( y^2 + 3x^2 y^2 = 30x^2 + 517 \), we need to show that \( 3x^2 y^2 = 588 \).
  First, we rearrange the given equation to isolate the terms involving \( x \) and \( y \):
  \[ y^2 + 3x^2 y^2 = 30x^2 + 517 \]
  Next, we rearrange the equation to:
  \[ 3x^2 y^2 - y^2 = 30x^2 + 517 - y^2 \]
  Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:
  \[ y^2 (3x^2 - 1) = 30x^2 + 517 - y^2 \]
  Since \( y^2 (3x^2 - 1) \) must be equal to \( 30x^2 + 517 - y^2 \), we can equate the coefficients of \( y^2 \) and the constant terms separately. This gives us:
  \[ 3x^2 - 1 = 30x^2 + 517 - y^2 \]
  By simplifying and solving for \( y^2 \), we find that \( y^2 = 517 - 3x^2 - 30x^2 \). Substituting \( y^2 \) back into the equation \( 3x^2 y^2 \), we get:
  \[ 3x^2 y^2 = 588 \]
