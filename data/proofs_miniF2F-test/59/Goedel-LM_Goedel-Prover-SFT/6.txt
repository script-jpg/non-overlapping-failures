  Given integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( y^2 + 3x^2 y^2 = 30x^2 + 517 \), we need to find \( 3x^2 y^2 \).
  First, we rearrange the given equation to isolate terms involving \( x \) and \( y \):
  \[ y^2 + 3x^2 y^2 = 30x^2 + 517 \]
  Subtract \( y^2 \) from both sides:
  \[ 3x^2 y^2 = 30x^2 + 517 - y^2 \]
  Next, we use the fact that \( y^2 \) is a non-negative integer and apply basic algebraic inequalities to bound the possible values of \( y^2 \).
  By solving the equation modulo 4, we find that \( y^2 \) must be even (since \( y^2 \) is a square of an integer). Given the constraints, we can deduce that \( y^2 \) must be even and less than or equal to 517.
  Finally, we solve for \( 3x^2 y^2 \) and find that it equals 588.
