  Given integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( y^2 + 3x^2 y^2 = 30x^2 + 517 \), we need to show that \( 3x^2 y^2 = 588 \).
  1. Start by noting the given equation \( y^2 + 3x^2 y^2 = 30x^2 + 517 \).
  2. Rearrange the equation to isolate terms involving \( x \) and \( y \).
  3. Use algebraic manipulation to simplify the equation.
  4. Solve for \( 3x^2 y^2 \) by manipulating the equation further.
