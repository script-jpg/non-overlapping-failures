  Given integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( y^2 + 3x^2 y^2 = 30x^2 + 517 \), we need to find \( 3x^2 y^2 \) and show that it equals 588.
  1. Start by considering the given equation \( y^2 + 3x^2 y^2 = 30x^2 + 517 \).
  2. Normalize the equation by expanding and simplifying it.
  3. Use algebraic manipulation to isolate terms involving \( x \) and \( y \).
  4. Recognize that the equation can be rewritten in a form that allows for simplification.
  5. Apply non-linear arithmetic to solve for the desired term \( 3x^2 y^2 \).
