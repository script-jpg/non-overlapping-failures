  Given integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( y^2 + 3x^2 y^2 = 30x^2 + 517 \), we need to find \( 3x^2 y^2 \) and show that it equals 588. We start by manipulating the given equation to isolate terms involving \( x \) and \( y \). By expanding and simplifying the equation, we can derive the value of \( 3x^2 y^2 \).
