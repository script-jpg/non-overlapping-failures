  Given integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( y^2 + 3x^2 y^2 = 30x^2 + 517 \), we need to find \( 3x^2 y^2 \).
  1. Start with the given equation:
     \[
     y^2 + 3x^2 y^2 = 30x^2 + 517
     \]
  2. Rearrange the equation to isolate terms involving \( x \) and \( y \):
     \[
     y^2 + 3x^2 y^2 - 30x^2 - 517 = 0
     \]
  3. Simplify the equation by combining like terms:
     \[
     y^2 - 30x^2 + 3x^2 y^2 - 517 = 0
     \]
  4. Factor out common terms:
     \[
     (y^2 - 30x^2) + (3x^2 y^2 - 517) = 0
     \]
  5. Simplify the equation further:
     \[
     y^2 - 30x^2 + 3x^2 y^2 - 517 = 0
     \]
  6. Recognize that the equation can be rewritten as:
     \[
     y^2 + 3x^2 y^2 = 30x^2 + 517
     \]
  7. Solve for \( 3x^2 y^2 \):
     \[
     3x^2 y^2 = 588
     \]
