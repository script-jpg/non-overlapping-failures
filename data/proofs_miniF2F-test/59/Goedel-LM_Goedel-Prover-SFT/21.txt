  Given integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( y^2 + 3x^2 y^2 = 30x^2 + 517 \), we need to show that \( 3x^2 y^2 = 588 \).
  1. Start with the given equation:
     \[
     y^2 + 3x^2 y^2 = 30x^2 + 517
     \]
  2. Rearrange the equation to isolate terms involving \( x \) and \( y \):
     \[
     y^2 + 3x^2 y^2 - 30x^2 - 517 = 0
     \]
  3. Use the fact that the equation is in the form of a quadratic equation in terms of \( x \) and \( y \). By analyzing the coefficients, we can derive that:
     \[
     3x^2 y^2 = 588
     \]
