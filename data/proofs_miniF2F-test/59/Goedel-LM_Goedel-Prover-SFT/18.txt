  Given integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( y^2 + 3x^2 y^2 = 30x^2 + 517 \), we need to find \( 3x^2 y^2 \) and show that it equals 588. We start by simplifying the given equation and manipulating it algebraically. We use the fact that the equation can be rearranged and simplified to isolate terms involving \( x \) and \( y \). By applying algebraic operations and simplifying, we derive the desired result.
