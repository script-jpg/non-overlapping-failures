  Given integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( y^2 + 3x^2 y^2 = 30x^2 + 517 \), we need to find \( 3x^2 y^2 \) and show that it equals 588.
  1. Start by isolating the term \( 3x^2 y^2 \) on one side of the equation.
  2. Use the given equation to express \( 3x^2 y^2 \) in terms of the other terms.
  3. Substitute and simplify to find the value of \( 3x^2 y^2 \).

  -- Apply the function `fun x => x - 30 * x ^ 2` to both sides of the equation to isolate the term involving `3 * (x ^ 2 * y ^ 2)`.
  have h₁ := congr_arg (fun x => x - 30 * x ^ 2) h₀
  -- Simplify the resulting equation to show that `3 * (x ^ 2 * y ^ 2) = 588`.
