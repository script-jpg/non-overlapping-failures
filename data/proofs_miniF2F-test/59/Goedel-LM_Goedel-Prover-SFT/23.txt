  Given integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( y^2 + 3x^2 y^2 = 30x^2 + 517 \), we need to find \( 3x^2 y^2 \) and show that it equals 588.
  1. Start by rewriting the given equation \( y^2 + 3x^2 y^2 = 30x^2 + 517 \).
  2. Rearrange the equation to isolate the terms involving \( y^2 \) and \( x^2 \).
  3. Simplify the equation to express \( y^2 \) in terms of \( x^2 \).
  4. Substitute the derived expression for \( y^2 \) back into the equation to verify the equality.
  5. Use algebraic manipulation and linear arithmetic to confirm that \( 3x^2 y^2 = 588 \).
