  Given integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( y^2 + 3x^2 y^2 = 30x^2 + 517 \), we need to show that \( 3x^2 y^2 = 588 \).
  1. Start by considering the given equation \( y^2 + 3x^2 y^2 = 30x^2 + 517 \).
  2. Rearrange the equation to isolate terms involving \( y^2 \) and \( x^2 \).
  3. Use algebraic manipulation to express \( y^2 \) in terms of \( x^2 \) and constants.
  4. Substitute the derived expression for \( y^2 \) back into the original equation to verify the equality.
