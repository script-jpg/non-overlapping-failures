    -- We need to find n + 2x, which is 97 - x + 2x = 97 + x
    -- From the second equation, we have n + 5x = 265, so n = 265 - 5x
    -- Substitute n = 265 - 5x into the first equation: 265 - 5x + x = 97
    -- Simplify to find x = 39
    -- Then, n = 97 - 39 = 58
    -- Finally, calculate n + 2x = 58 + 2 * 39 = 58 + 78 = 136
    -- This is incorrect, so we need to correct our approach
