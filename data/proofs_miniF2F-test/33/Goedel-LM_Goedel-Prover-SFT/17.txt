  Given the conditions:
  1. \( n + x = 97 \) (the total charge for a one-hour repair job)
  2. \( n + 5x = 265 \) (the total charge for a five-hour repair job)
  We need to find the total charge for a two-hour repair job, which is \( n + 2x \).
  First, we solve the system of equations to find \( n \) and \( x \):
  \[
  \begin{cases}
  n + x = 97 \\
  n + 5x = 265
  \end{cases}
  \]
  Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( n \):
  \[
  (n + 5x) - (n + x) = 265 - 97
  \]
  \[
  4x = 168
  \]
  \[
  x = 42
  \]
  Substitute \( x = 42 \) back into the first equation to find \( n \):
  \[
  n + 42 = 97
  \]
  \[
  n = 55
  \]
  Now, calculate the total charge for a two-hour repair job:
  \[
  n + 2x = 55 + 2 \cdot 42 = 55 + 84 = 139
  \]
  Thus, the total charge for a two-hour repair job is \( \boxed{139} \).
