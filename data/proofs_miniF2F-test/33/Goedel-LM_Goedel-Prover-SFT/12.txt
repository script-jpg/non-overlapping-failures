  Given the charges for plumbing repair jobs:
  - For a one-hour repair job, Mr. Wrench charges \( N \) dollars for coming out to the house plus \( x \) dollars per hour that he works at the house.
  - For a five-hour repair job, the total charge is \( \$265 \).
  - For a one-hour repair job, the total charge is \( \$97 \).
  We need to determine the charge for a two-hour repair job.
  First, we express the given charges in terms of \( N \) and \( x \):
  1. \( N + x = 97 \)
  2. \( N + 5x = 265 \)
  To find the charge for a two-hour repair job, we need to solve for \( N \) and \( x \) and then use these values to calculate \( N + 2x \).
  Subtract the first equation from the second:
  \[ (N + 5x) - (N + x) = 265 - 97 \]
  \[ 4x = 168 \]
  \[ x = 42 \]
  Substitute \( x = 42 \) back into the first equation:
  \[ N + 42 = 97 \]
  \[ N = 55 \]
  Now, calculate the charge for a two-hour repair job:
  \[ N + 2x = 55 + 2 \times 42 = 55 + 84 = 139 \]
  Thus, the charge for a two-hour repair job is \( \$139 \).
