  Given the charges for two plumbing repair jobs:
  1. For a one-hour repair job, Mr. Wrench charges \( N \) dollars for coming out to the house plus \( x \) dollars per hour that he works at the house.
  2. For a five-hour repair job, Mr. Wrench charges \( N + 5x \) dollars.
  We know the total charge for the one-hour job is \( 97 \) dollars and the total charge for the five-hour job is \( 265 \) dollars.
  We need to find the charge for a two-hour repair job, which is \( N + 2x \).
  From the given equations:
  \[ N + x = 97 \]
  \[ N + 5x = 265 \]
  We can solve for \( N \) and \( x \) using these equations.
  Subtract the first equation from the second:
  \[ (N + 5x) - (N + x) = 265 - 97 \]
  \[ 4x = 168 \]
  \[ x = 42 \]
  Substitute \( x = 42 \) back into the first equation:
  \[ N + 42 = 97 \]
  \[ N = 55 \]
  Now, calculate the charge for a two-hour repair job:
  \[ N + 2x = 55 + 2 \times 42 = 55 + 84 = 139 \]
  Thus, the charge for a two-hour repair job is \( 139 \) dollars.

  -- We need to solve for N and x using the given equations.
  have h₂ : 4 * x = 168 := by
    -- Subtract the first equation from the second to isolate 4x.
    linarith
  have h₃ : x = 42 := by
    -- Solve for x by dividing both sides of 4x = 168 by 4.
    linarith
  have h₄ : n = 55 := by
    -- Substitute x = 42 into the first equation to solve for n.
    linarith
  -- Substitute the values of n and x into the expression for the two-hour job.
  rw [h₃, h₄]
  -- Verify that the result is indeed 139.
