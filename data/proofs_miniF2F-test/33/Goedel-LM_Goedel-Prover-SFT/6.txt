  Given the conditions:
  1. For a one-hour repair job, Mr. Wrench charges \( n \) dollars plus \( x \) dollars per hour.
  2. For a five-hour repair job, Mr. Wrench charges \( n \) dollars plus \( 5x \) dollars per hour.
  3. The total cost for the one-hour repair job is \( 97 \) dollars.
  4. The total cost for the five-hour repair job is \( 265 \) dollars.
  We need to determine the total cost for a two-hour repair job.
  From the given equations:
  \[ n + x = 97 \]
  \[ n + 5x = 265 \]
  We can solve for \( n \) and \( x \).
  Subtract the first equation from the second:
  \[ (n + 5x) - (n + x) = 265 - 97 \]
  \[ 4x = 168 \]
  \[ x = 42 \]
  Substitute \( x = 42 \) back into the first equation:
  \[ n + 42 = 97 \]
  \[ n = 55 \]
  Now, calculate the total cost for a two-hour repair job:
  \[ n + 2x = 55 + 2 \cdot 42 = 55 + 84 = 139 \]
  Thus, the total cost for a two-hour repair job is \( 139 \) dollars.
