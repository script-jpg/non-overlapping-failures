  Given the conditions:
  1. For a one-hour repair job, Mr. Wrench charges \( N \) dollars for coming out to the house plus \( x \) dollars per hour he works at the house. The total cost for a one-hour repair is \( N + x = 97 \).
  2. For a five-hour repair job, the total cost is \( N + 5x = 265 \).
  We need to find the cost for a two-hour repair job, which is given by \( N + 2x \).
  First, we solve the system of equations to find \( N \) and \( x \):
  \[
  \begin{cases}
  N + x = 97 \\
  N + 5x = 265
  \end{cases}
  \]
  Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( N \):
  \[
  (N + 5x) - (N + x) = 265 - 97
  \]
  \[
  4x = 168
  \]
  \[
  x = 42
  \]
  Substitute \( x = 42 \) back into the first equation to find \( N \):
  \[
  N + 42 = 97
  \]
  \[
  N = 97 - 42
  \]
  \[
  N = 55
  \]
  Now, calculate the cost for a two-hour repair job:
  \[
  N + 2x = 55 + 2 \times 42 = 55 + 84 = 139
  \]
  Thus, the cost for a two-hour repair job is \( 139 \).
