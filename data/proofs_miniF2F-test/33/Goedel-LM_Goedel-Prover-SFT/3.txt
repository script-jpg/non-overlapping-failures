  Given the charges for plumbing repair jobs:
  - For a one-hour repair job, Mr. Wrench charges \( N \) dollars for coming out to the house plus \( x \) dollars per hour that he works at the house. This results in a total of \( N + x = 97 \) dollars.
  - For a five-hour repair job, Mr. Wrench charges \( N \) dollars for coming out to the house plus \( 5x \) dollars that he works at the house. This results in a total of \( N + 5x = 265 \) dollars.
  We need to determine the charge for a two-hour repair job. By subtracting the one-hour job charge from the five-hour job charge, we find:
  \[ (N + 5x) - (N + x) = 265 - 97 \]
  \[ 4x = 168 \]
  \[ x = 42 \]
  Substituting \( x = 42 \) back into the one-hour job charge:
  \[ N + 42 = 97 \]
  \[ N = 97 - 42 = 55 \]
  Now, for a two-hour repair job:
  \[ N + 2x = 55 + 2 \times 42 = 55 + 84 = 139 \]
  Thus, the charge for a two-hour repair job is \( 139 \) dollars.
