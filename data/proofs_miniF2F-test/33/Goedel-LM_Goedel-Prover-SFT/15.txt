  Given the equations:
  1. \( n + x = 97 \)
  2. \( n + 5x = 265 \)
  We need to find \( n + 2x \).
  First, solve for \( n \) using the first equation:
  \[ n = 97 - x \]
  Substitute \( n \) into the second equation:
  \[ 97 - x + 5x = 265 \]
  Simplify the equation:
  \[ 97 + 4x = 265 \]
  Solve for \( x \):
  \[ 4x = 265 - 97 \]
  \[ 4x = 168 \]
  \[ x = 42 \]
  Now substitute \( x \) back into the expression for \( n \):
  \[ n = 97 - 42 \]
  \[ n = 55 \]
  Finally, calculate \( n + 2x \):
  \[ n + 2x = 55 + 2 \times 42 \]
  \[ n + 2x = 55 + 84 \]
  \[ n + 2x = 139 \]
