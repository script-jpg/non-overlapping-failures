  Given the charges for plumbing repair jobs:
  - For a one-hour repair job, Mr. Wrench charges \( N \) dollars.
  - For a five-hour repair job, Mr. Wrench charges \( 2N \) dollars.
  We know the total charges for these two jobs:
  - The one-hour job charges \( N \) dollars.
  - The five-hour job charges \( 2N \) dollars.
  We are given the equations:
  \[ N + x = 97 \]
  \[ N + 5x = 265 \]
  To find the charge for a two-hour repair job, we need to determine \( N + 2x \).
  First, we solve for \( N \) using the first equation:
  \[ N = 97 - x \]
  Next, substitute \( N \) into the second equation:
  \[ (97 - x) + 5x = 265 \]
  Simplify the equation:
  \[ 97 + 4x = 265 \]
  \[ 4x = 168 \]
  \[ x = 42 \]
  Now, substitute \( x = 42 \) back into the expression for \( N \):
  \[ N = 97 - 42 \]
  \[ N = 55 \]
  Finally, calculate the charge for a two-hour repair job:
  \[ N + 2x = 55 + 2 \cdot 42 \]
  \[ N + 2x = 55 + 84 \]
  \[ N + 2x = 139 \]
