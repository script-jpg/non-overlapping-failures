  Given the charges for Mr. Wrench's plumbing repair jobs, we need to determine the charge for a two-hour repair job. We know that for a one-hour job, the total charge is \$97, and for a five-hour job, the total charge is \$265. We can express these charges as the sum of a base charge \( N \) and the charge per hour \( x \).
  1. From the given information, we have the equations:
     \[
     N + x = 97
     \]
     \[
     N + 5x = 265
     \]
  2. To find \( N \) and \( x \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
     \[
     (N + 5x) - (N + x) = 265 - 97
     \]
     Simplifying this, we get:
     \[
     4x = 168 \implies x = 42
     \]
  3. Substituting \( x = 42 \) back into the first equation:
     \[
     N + 42 = 97 \implies N = 97 - 42 = 55
     \]
  4. Now, we need to find the charge for a two-hour job:
     \[
     N + 2x = 55 + 2 \cdot 42 = 55 + 84 = 139
     \]
  Thus, the charge for a two-hour repair job is \$139.
