  Given that Mr. Wrench charges \( N \) dollars for coming out to the house plus \( x \) dollars per hour he works at the house. We know that for a one-hour repair job, he charges \( \$97 \), and for a five-hour repair job, he charges \( \$265 \). We need to determine his charge for a two-hour repair job.
  From the given information, we have the following equations:
  1. \( N + x = 97 \)
  2. \( N + 5x = 265 \)
  To find \( N + 2x \), we can use these equations. First, subtract the first equation from the second:
  \[ (N + 5x) - (N + x) = 265 - 97 \]
  \[ 4x = 168 \]
  \[ x = 42 \]
  Next, substitute \( x = 42 \) back into the first equation to find \( N \):
  \[ N + 42 = 97 \]
  \[ N = 55 \]
  Now, calculate \( N + 2x \):
  \[ N + 2x = 55 + 2 \times 42 \]
  \[ N + 2x = 55 + 84 \]
  \[ N + 2x = 139 \]
  Thus, the charge for a two-hour repair job is \( \$139 \).
