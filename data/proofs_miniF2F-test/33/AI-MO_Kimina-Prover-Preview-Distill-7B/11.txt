-- From the given conditions, we have the equations:  
  -- 1. n + x = 97 (for the one-hour repair)  
  -- 2. n + 5x = 265 (for the five-hour repair)  

  -- We need to find the value of n + 2x (for a two-hour repair).

  -- Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate n:  
  -- (n + 5x) - (n + x) = 265 - 97  
  -- 4x = 168  
  -- x = 168 / 4 = 42

  have eq1 : 4 * x = 168 := by linarith

  -- Now that we have x = 42, substitute back into the first equation to find n:  
  -- n + 42 = 97  
  -- n = 97 - 42 = 55

  have eq2 : n = 55 := by linarith

  -- Now calculate the charge for a two-hour repair: n + 2x = 55 + 2(42) = 55 + 84 = 139
