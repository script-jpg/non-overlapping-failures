-- The equations are

  -- $n + x = 97$ and $n + 5x = 265$.

  -- Thus, $4x = 265 - 97 = 168$, so $x = 42$.

  -- So, $n = 97 - 42 = 55$, and $n + 2x = 55 + 2 * 42 = \boxed{139}$.

This Lean 4 proof is remarkably concise because Lean's `linarith` tactic is powerful enough to solve systems of linear equations and inequalities. It automatically handles all the algebraic manipulations that we would do by hand:

1. It recognizes that we have a system of two equations: `n + x = 97` and `n + 5x = 265`.
2. It subtracts the first equation from the second to eliminate `n`: `(n + 5x) - (n + x) = 265 - 97`, which simplifies to `4x = 168`.
3. It solves for `x`: `x = 168 / 4 = 42`.
4. It substitutes `x = 42` back into the first equation: `n + 42 = 97`, so `n = 97 - 42 = 55`.
5. It computes the charge for a two-hour repair job: `n + 2x = 55 + 2 * 42 = 55 + 84 = 139`.

The `linarith` tactic is able to perform all these steps automatically because they are standard techniques for solving linear systems, and Lean's automation is powerful enough to handle them without requiring explicit human guidance.

Therefore, the charge for a two-hour repair job is \$139.

/- For each plumbing repair job, Mr. Wrench charges $N$ dollars for coming out to the house plus $x$ dollars per hour that he works at the house. He charged $\$97$ for a one-hour repair job and $\$265$ for a five-hour repair job. What is his charge for a two-hour repair job? Show that it is \$ 139.-/
