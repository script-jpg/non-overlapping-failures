-- This is a system of equations problem. We have two equations:
  -- 1. `n + x = 97` (for a one-hour repair job)
  -- 2. `n + 5x = 265` (for a five-hour repair job)
  -- We need to find `n + 2x` (for a two-hour repair job)

  -- To solve this algebraically, we would subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate `n`:
  -- `(n + 5x) - (n + x) = 265 - 97`
  -- `4x = 168`
  -- `x = 168 / 4 = 42`

  -- Substituting `x = 42` back into the first equation:
  -- `n + 42 = 97`
  -- `n = 97 - 42 = 55`

  -- Therefore, for a two-hour repair job:
  -- `n + 2x = 55 + 2(42) = 55 + 84 = 139`

  -- In Lean, we can use the `linarith` tactic which is powerful enough to solve systems of linear arithmetic goals:
  linarith
```

The Lean 4 solution is remarkably concise. The `linarith` tactic is able to automatically solve systems of linear arithmetic goals. It takes the two given equations as hypotheses (`h₀` and `h₁`) and proves that `n + 2 * x = 139` follows from them.

The informal algebraic solution shows that:
1. Subtract the first equation from the second to find the value of `x`
2. Substitute `x` back into the first equation to find the value of `n`
3. Compute `n + 2x` to find the charge for a two-hour repair job

The Lean proof directly proves the goal from the two given equations without explicitly solving for `n` and `x` separately. The beauty of the `linarith` tactic is that it can handle these kinds of linear systems automatically.

/-- For each plumbing repair job, Mr. Wrench charges $N$ dollars for coming out to the house plus $x$ dollars per hour that he works at the house. He charged $\$97$ for a one-hour repair job and $\$265$ for a five-hour repair job. What is his charge for a two-hour repair job? Show that it is \$ 139.-/
