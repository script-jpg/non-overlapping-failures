-- Solving the system of linear equations, we get n = 22 and x = 75.

  -- Mr. Wrench's charge for a two-hour repair job is $n + 2 \cdot x = 22 + 2 \cdot 75 = 22 + 150 = 172$ dollars.

  -- However, the answer is $ \boxed{139} $, which suggests that my calculation is incorrect.

  -- Let me recompute. Solving the system of equations:

  -- 1. n + x = 97

  -- 2. n + 5x = 265

  -- Subtracting the first equation from the second gives: 4x = 168, so x = 42.

  -- Substituting x = 42 into the first equation: n + 42 = 97, so n = 55.

  -- Therefore, for a two-hour repair job, Mr. Wrench's charge is: n + 2x = 55 + 2 \cdot 42 = 55 + 84 = 139.

  -- This matches the expected answer of $ \boxed{139} $.
