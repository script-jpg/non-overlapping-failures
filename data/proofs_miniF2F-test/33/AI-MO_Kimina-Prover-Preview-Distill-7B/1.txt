-- Subtracting the two equations, we get $4x = 265 - 97 = 168$, so $x = 42$.
  have h2 : 4 * x = 168 := by linarith only [h₀, h₁]
  have hx : x = 42 := by linarith only [h2]

  -- Substituting it back, we get $n + 42 = 97$, so $n = 55$.
  have hn : n = 55 := by linarith only [h₀, hx]

  -- Plugging in $n$ and $x$ into the desired equation, we get $55 + 42 = 97$.
  linarith only [hn, hx]
