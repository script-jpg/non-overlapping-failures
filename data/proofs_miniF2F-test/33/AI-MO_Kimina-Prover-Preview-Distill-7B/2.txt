-- Subtracting the two equations, we get $4x = 265 - 97 = 168$, so $x = 42$.
  have hx : x = 42 := by linarith

  -- Substituting $x = 42$ into the first equation, we get $n + 42 = 97$, so $n = 55$.
  have hn : n = 55 := by linarith

  -- Thus, the charge for a two-hour repair job is $n + 2x = 55 + 2\cdot 42 = \boxed{139}$.
