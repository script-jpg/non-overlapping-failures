-- This is a system of equations problem. We have two equations based on the given information:
  -- 1. n + x = 97 (for a one-hour repair job)
  -- 2. n + 5x = 265 (for a five-hour repair job)
  -- We need to find the value of n + 2x (for a two-hour repair job)

  -- First, let's think about how to solve this algebraically. We can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate n:
  -- (n + 5x) - (n + x) = 265 - 97
  -- 4x = 168
  -- x = 168 / 4 = 42

  -- Now that we have x = 42, we can substitute it back into the first equation to find n:
  -- n + 42 = 97
  -- n = 97 - 42 = 55

  -- Finally, we can calculate n + 2x:
  -- n + 2x = 55 + 2(42) = 55 + 84 = 139

  -- Let's translate this into Lean 2 proof tactics:

  -- We have our two equations as hypotheses:
  -- h₀: n + x = 97
  -- h₁: n + 5x = 265

  -- To find x, we subtract h₀ from h₁:
  have hx : x = 42 := by
    linarith

  -- Now that we have x = 42, we substitute into h₀ to find n:
  have hn : n = 55 := by
    rw [hx] at h₀
    linarith

  -- Finally, we calculate n + 2x:
  show n + 2 * x = 139
  rw [hn, hx]
