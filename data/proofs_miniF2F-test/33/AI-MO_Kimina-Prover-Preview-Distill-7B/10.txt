-- Solving the system of equations: $n + x = 97$ and $n + 5x = 265$
  -- Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate $n$: 
  -- $(n + 5x) - (n + x) = 265 - 97$
  -- $4x = 168$
  -- $x = 168 / 4 = 42$
  have hx : x = 42 := by
    linarith

  -- Substitute $x = 42$ back into the first equation: $n + 42 = 97$
  -- Solving for $n$ gives $n = 97 - 42 = 55$
  have hn : n = 55 := by
    linarith

  -- Now calculate the charge for a two-hour repair job: $n + 2x = 55 + 2 \cdot 42 = 55 + 84 = 139$
