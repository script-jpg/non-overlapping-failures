-- Solving the system of equations: \[ \begin{align*}
  -- n + x &= 97 \\
  -- n + 5x &= 265
  -- \end{align*} \]

  -- Subtracting the first equation from the second: $4x = 168$, so $x = 42$.
  have hx : x = 42 := by linarith

  -- Substituting $x = 42$ into $n + x = 97$: $n + 42 = 97 \implies n = 55$.
  have hn : n = 55 := by linarith

  -- Therefore, for a two-hour repair job, Mr. Wrench charges: $n + 2x = 55 + 2 \cdot 42 = 55 + 84 = 139$.
