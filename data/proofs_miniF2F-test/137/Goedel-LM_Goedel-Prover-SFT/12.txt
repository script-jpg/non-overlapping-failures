  To determine the remainder when \(5^{30}\) is divided by 7, we can use properties of modular arithmetic. Specifically, we will show that \(5^{30} \equiv 1 \pmod{7}\).
  1. First, observe that \(5^2 = 25 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}\).
  2. Next, note that \(5^4 = (5^2)^2 = 4^2 = 16 \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\).
  3. We can continue this pattern: \(5^8 = (5^4)^2 = 2^2 = 4 \pmod{7}\).
  4. Notice that \(5^{16} = (5^8)^2 = 4^2 = 16 \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\).
  By these calculations, we see that \(5^n \pmod{7}\) alternates between 1 and 4 depending on whether \(n\) is even or odd. Since 30 is even, we have:
  \[ 5^{30} \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
  Thus, the remainder when \(5^{30}\) is divided by 7 is 1.
