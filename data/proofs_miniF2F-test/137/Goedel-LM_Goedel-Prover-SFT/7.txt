  To determine the remainder when \(5^{30}\) is divided by 7, we can use modular arithmetic properties. First, observe that \(5 \equiv -2 \pmod{7}\). Therefore, we have:
  \[
  5^{30} \equiv (-2)^{30} \pmod{7}
  \]
  Since \((-2)^{30} = 2^{30}\), we need to find \(2^{30} \mod 7\). We can use the fact that \(2^3 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}\), simplifying the exponent modulo 3:
  \[
  30 \equiv 0 \pmod{3}
  \]
  Thus,
  \[
  2^{30} \equiv 2^0 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
  \]
  Therefore, the remainder when \(5^{30}\) is divided by 7 is 1.

  simp [pow_mod, (by decide : 7 ≠ 0), (by decide : 7 ≠ 1)]
  -- Since 5 ≡ -2 (mod 7), we have 5^30 ≡ (-2)^30 (mod 7).
  -- Since (-2)^30 = 2^30, we need to find 2^30 % 7.
  -- We know 2^3 ≡ 1 (mod 7), so we can simplify the exponent modulo 3.
  -- 30 ≡ 0 (mod 3), so 2^30 ≡ 2^0 ≡ 1 (mod 7).
  -- Therefore, 5^30 % 7 = 1.
