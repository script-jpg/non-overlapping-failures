  To determine the remainder when \(5^{30}\) is divided by 7, we can use properties of modular arithmetic. Specifically, we will show that \(5^{30} \equiv 1 \pmod{7}\).
  1. First, observe that \(5^3 = 125\) and \(125 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}\).
  2. This implies \(5^3 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}\).
  3. Next, consider \(5^6 = (5^3)^2 \equiv 6^2 = 36\).
  4. Since \(36 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}\), we have \(5^6 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}\).
  5. We can express \(5^{30}\) as \((5^6)^5\).
  6. Using the congruence \(5^6 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}\), we get \((5^6)^5 \equiv 1^5 = 1 \pmod{7}\).
  Thus, the remainder when \(5^{30}\) is divided by 7 is 1.
