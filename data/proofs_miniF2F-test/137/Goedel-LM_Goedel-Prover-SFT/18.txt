  To determine the remainder when \(5^{30}\) is divided by 7, we can use properties of modular arithmetic. Specifically, we will use the fact that \(5^3 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}\), which simplifies the calculation of \(5^{30}\) modulo 7.
  1. First, observe that \(5^3 = 125\) and \(125 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}\).
  2. Therefore, \(5^3 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}\).
  3. Next, we can express \(5^{30}\) as \((5^3)^{10}\).
  4. Since \(5^3 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}\), it follows that \((5^3)^{10} \equiv 6^{10} \pmod{7}\).
  5. Calculate \(6^{10} \pmod{7}\):
     - \(6^2 = 36 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}\)
     - \(6^{10} = (6^2)^5 = 1^5 = 1 \pmod{7}\)
  6. Thus, \(5^{30} \equiv 1 \pmod{7}\).
