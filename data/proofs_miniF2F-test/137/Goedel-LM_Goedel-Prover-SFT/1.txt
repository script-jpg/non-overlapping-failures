  To determine the remainder when \(5^{30}\) is divided by 7, we can use properties of modular arithmetic. Specifically, we will show that \(5^{30} \equiv 1 \pmod{7}\).
  First, observe that:
  \[ 5 \equiv -2 \pmod{7} \]
  Thus, we can rewrite \(5^{30}\) in terms of \(-2\):
  \[ 5^{30} \equiv (-2)^{30} \pmod{7} \]
  Since \((-2)^{30} = 2^{30}\) and \(2^{30}\) is a power of 2, we can simplify further:
  \[ 2^{30} \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
  This is because \(2^3 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}\), and thus:
  \[ 2^{30} = (2^3)^{10} \equiv 1^{10} \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
  Therefore, the remainder when \(5^{30}\) is divided by 7 is 1.
