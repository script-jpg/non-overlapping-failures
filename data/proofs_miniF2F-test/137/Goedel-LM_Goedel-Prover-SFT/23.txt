  To determine the remainder when \(5^{30}\) is divided by 7, we can use properties of modular arithmetic. Specifically, we will show that \(5^{30} \equiv 1 \pmod{7}\).
  1. First, observe that \(5 \equiv -2 \pmod{7}\). This is because \(5 = 3 \times 2 + 1\), so \(5 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}\).
  2. Using this equivalence, we can rewrite \(5^{30}\) in terms of \(-2\):
     \[
     5^{30} \equiv (-2)^{30} \pmod{7}
     \]
  3. Since \((-2)^{30} = 2^{30}\) (because raising a negative number to an even power results in a positive number), we have:
     \[
     5^{30} \equiv 2^{30} \pmod{7}
     \]
  4. Next, we need to determine the value of \(2^{30} \pmod{7}\). Notice that:
     \[
     2^3 = 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
     \]
  5. Therefore, for any integer \(k\), \(2^{3k} \equiv 1^k \equiv 1 \pmod{7}\). Since 30 is divisible by 3, we can write:
     \[
     2^{30} = (2^3)^{10} \equiv 1^{10} \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
     \]
  6. Thus, \(5^{30} \equiv 1 \pmod{7}\), and the remainder when \(5^{30}\) is divided by 7 is 1.
