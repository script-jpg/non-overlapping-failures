  To determine the remainder when \(5^{30}\) is divided by 7, we can use modular arithmetic properties. First, we observe the pattern in the powers of 5 modulo 7.
  1. \(5^1 \equiv 5 \pmod{7}\)
  2. \(5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}\)
  3. \(5^3 \equiv 5 \cdot 4 \equiv 20 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}\)
  4. \(5^4 \equiv 5 \cdot 6 \equiv 30 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}\)
  From \(5^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}\), we see that \(5^n \equiv 1 \pmod{7}\) if \(n\) is a multiple of 4. Since 30 is a multiple of 4, we have:
  \[ 5^{30} \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \]
  Thus, the remainder when \(5^{30}\) is divided by 7 is 1.
