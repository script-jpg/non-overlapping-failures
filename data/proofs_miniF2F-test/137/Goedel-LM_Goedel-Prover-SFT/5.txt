  To determine the remainder when \(5^{30}\) is divided by 7, we can use properties of modular arithmetic. First, we observe that \(5 \equiv 5 \pmod{7}\). We need to find \(5^{30} \mod 7\). Notice that \(5^3 = 125 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}\). This implies that \(5^3 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}\). Therefore, for any integer \(k\), \(5^{3k} \equiv 1^k \equiv 1 \pmod{7}\). Since 30 is a multiple of 3, we can write 30 as \(3 \times 10\). Thus, \(5^{30} = (5^3)^{10} \equiv 1^{10} \equiv 1 \pmod{7}\). Hence, the remainder when \(5^{30}\) is divided by 7 is 1.
