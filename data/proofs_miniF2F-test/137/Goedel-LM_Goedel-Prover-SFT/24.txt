  To determine the remainder when \(5^{30}\) is divided by 7, we can use modular arithmetic properties. First, we find the pattern of powers of 5 modulo 7. We observe that:
  \[
  5^1 \equiv 5 \pmod{7}
  \]
  \[
  5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
  \]
  \[
  5^3 \equiv 5 \cdot 4 \equiv 20 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
  \]
  \[
  5^4 \equiv 5 \cdot 6 \equiv 30 \equiv 2 \pmod{7}
  \]
  \[
  5^5 \equiv 5 \cdot 2 \equiv 10 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}
  \]
  \[
  5^6 \equiv 5 \cdot 3 \equiv 15 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
  \]
  Thus, the powers of 5 modulo 7 cycle every 6 steps. Since 30 is a multiple of 6, we have:
  \[
  5^{30} \equiv (5^6)^5 \equiv 1^5 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
  \]
  Therefore, the remainder when \(5^{30}\) is divided by 7 is 1.
