  To determine the remainder when \(5^{30}\) is divided by 7, we can use properties of modular arithmetic. Specifically, we will use the fact that \(5^3 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}\). This allows us to simplify \(5^{30}\) modulo 7 by expressing it in terms of multiples of 3.
  1. Start by noting that \(5^3 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}\).
  2. Express \(5^{30}\) as \((5^3)^{10}\).
  3. Since \(5^3 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}\), it follows that \((5^3)^{10} \equiv 1^{10} \pmod{7}\).
  4. Simplify \(1^{10}\) to get \(1\).
  Thus, the remainder when \(5^{30}\) is divided by 7 is 1.

  -- The above line simplifies the expression using modular arithmetic properties.
  -- Specifically, it uses the fact that 5^3 ≡ 1 (mod 7), allowing us to reduce 5^30 to 1^10.
  -- Since 1^10 = 1, the result is 1 modulo 7.
