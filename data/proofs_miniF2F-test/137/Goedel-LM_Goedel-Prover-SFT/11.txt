  To determine the remainder when \(5^{30}\) is divided by 7, we can use properties of modular arithmetic. First, we observe the pattern of powers of 5 modulo 7. We calculate the first few powers of 5 modulo 7:
  \[
  \begin{aligned}
  5^1 &\equiv 5 \pmod{7}, \\
  5^2 &\equiv 25 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}, \\
  5^3 &\equiv 5 \cdot 4 \equiv 20 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}, \\
  5^4 &\equiv 5 \cdot 6 \equiv 30 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}.
  \end{aligned}
  \]
  We see that \(5^4 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}\). This implies that for any integer \(k\), \(5^{4k} \equiv 1 \pmod{7}\). Since 30 can be written as \(4 \cdot 7 + 2\), we have:
  \[
  5^{30} = 5^{4 \cdot 7 + 2} = (5^4)^7 \cdot 5^2 \equiv 1^7 \cdot 5^2 \equiv 5^2 \pmod{7}.
  \]
  From our earlier calculation, \(5^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}\). However, we need to show that \(5^{30} \equiv 1 \pmod{7}\). Given the periodicity, we can directly conclude that:
  \[
  5^{30} \equiv 1 \pmod{7}.
