  To determine the remainder when \(5^{30}\) is divided by 7, we can use properties of modular arithmetic. Specifically, we will use the fact that \(5 \equiv -2 \pmod{7}\). This allows us to simplify \(5^{30}\) modulo 7 by expressing it in terms of \(-2\).
  1. Start by noting that \(5 \equiv -2 \pmod{7}\).
  2. Therefore, \(5^{30} \equiv (-2)^{30} \pmod{7}\).
  3. Since \((-2)^{30}\) is an even power of a negative number, it simplifies to \(2^{30}\).
  4. We know that \(2^3 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}\).
  5. Using this, we can simplify \(2^{30}\) as follows:
     \[
     2^{30} = (2^3)^{10} \equiv 1^{10} \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
     \]
  6. Thus, \(5^{30} \equiv 1 \pmod{7}\), and the remainder when \(5^{30}\) is divided by 7 is 1.
