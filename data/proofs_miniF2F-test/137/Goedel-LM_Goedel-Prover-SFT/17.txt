  To determine the remainder when \(5^{30}\) is divided by 7, we can use modular arithmetic properties and simplify the expression step by step.
  1. First, observe that \(5 \equiv -2 \pmod{7}\).
  2. Using this equivalence, we can rewrite \(5^{30}\) in terms of \(-2\):
     \[
     5^{30} \equiv (-2)^{30} \pmod{7}
     \]
  3. Since \((-2)^{30} = 2^{30}\) (because raising a negative number to an even power results in a positive number), we have:
     \[
     5^{30} \equiv 2^{30} \pmod{7}
     \]
  4. Next, we need to compute \(2^{30} \mod 7\). Notice that:
     \[
     2^3 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
     \]
  5. Therefore, we can express \(2^{30}\) as:
     \[
     2^{30} = (2^3)^{10} \equiv 1^{10} \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
     \]
  6. Thus, we have shown that:
     \[
     5^{30} \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
     \]
