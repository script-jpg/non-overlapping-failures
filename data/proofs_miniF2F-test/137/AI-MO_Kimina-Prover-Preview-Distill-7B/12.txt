-- To solve this, we can look at the pattern of remainders when powers of 5 are divided by 7.
  -- As we calculate the remainders of successive powers of 5 modulo 7, we find they repeat every 6 terms.
  -- this is because of Fermat's Little Theorem, as 7 is a prime number.
  -- We can calculate the remainder of $5^6$ modulo 7 first.
  have step1 : 5 ^ 6 % 7 = 1 := by norm_num
  -- According to Fermat's Little Theorem, $a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$ for a prime $p$ and an integer $a$ not divisible by $p$.
  -- Here, $p = 7$ and $a = 5$, so $5^{6} \equiv 1 \pmod{7}$.
  -- We can use this to simplify $5^{30}$ modulo 7.
  have step2 : 5 ^ 30 % 7 = (5 ^ 6) ^ 5 % 7 := by ring_nf

  -- We can use the property that $(a \bmod m)^n \bmod m = a^n \bmod m$.

  -- From the above, we know $5^6 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}$, so $(5^6)^5 \equiv 1^5 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}$.
