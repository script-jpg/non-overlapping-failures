-- We apply Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that if $p$ is a prime and $a$ is an integer not divisible by $p$,
  -- then $a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$.
  -- Here, $p = 7$ and $a = 5$, so $5^{6} \equiv 1 \pmod{7}$.
  have h1 : 5 ^ 6 % 7 = 1 := by decide

  -- Then, $5^{30} = (5^{6})^{5}$, so $5^{30} \equiv 1^{5} = 1 \pmod{7}$.
