In this proof, we first establish that $5^6 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}$ using Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that if $p$ is a prime and $a$ is an integer not divisible by $p$, then $a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$. Here, $p = 7$ and $a = 5$. 

Next, we compute $5^{30} \bmod 7$. Notice that $5^{30} = (5^6)^5$. Since we've established that $5^6 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}$, we have $(5^6)^5 \equiv 1^5 \pmod{7}$. 

Since $1^5 = 1$, we conclude that $5^{30} \equiv 1 \pmod{7}$. Therefore, the remainder when $5^{30}$ is divided by 7 is 1.

The Lean proof elegantly captures this mathematical reasoning by first proving the auxiliary fact about $5^6$ and then using `norm_num` to compute the final result from this fact.
