-- We apply Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that if $p$ is a prime and $a$ is an integer not divisible by $p$, -- then $a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$. Here, $p = 7$ and $a = 5$.

  have h1 : 7.Prime := by norm_num
  have h2 : Nat.gcd 5 7 = 1 := by norm_num

  -- By Fermat's Little Theorem, we have $5^{6} \equiv 1 \pmod{7}$.

  have h3 : 5 ^ 6 % 7 = 1 := by
    rw [Nat.pow_mod]
    rfl

  -- Since $5^6 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}$, we can raise both sides to the power of 5 to get $5^{30} \equiv 1^5 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}$.
