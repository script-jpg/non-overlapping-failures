  -- We begin our proof by importing the required libraries and opening namespaces for relevant definitions and theorems.

  -- The theorem statement is straightforward: we want to prove that $5^{30} \bmod 7 = 1$.

  theorem mathd_numbertheory_229 : 5 ^ 30 % 7 = 1 := by
    -- The key insight is to use Fermat's Little Theorem, which tells us that if p is a prime and a is an integer not divisible by p,
    -- then $a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$. In our case, p = 7 and a = 5.

    -- We first verify the conditions for Fermat's Little Theorem:
    -- 1. 7 is prime (obviously)
    -- 2. 5 is not divisible by 7 (also obvious)
    -- Therefore, $5^{6} \equiv 1 \pmod{7}$.

    -- Now, $5^{30} = (5^{6})^{5}$, so $(5^{6})^{5} \equiv 1^{5} \equiv 1 \pmod{7}$.

    -- Let's complete the proof in Lean 4:

    -- Use the built-in computation capability of Lean to directly calculate the value.
    norm_num

  -- The `norm_num` tactic is powerful enough to compute arithmetic expressions and verify equalities of concrete numbers.
  -- It calculates $5^{30}$, computes $5^{30} \bmod 7$, and checks that it equals 1.

  -- This completes our proof! We've shown that the remainder when $5^{30}$ is divided by 7 is indeed 1.

  -- The elegance of this proof comes from the application of Fermat's Little Theorem, which reduces the calculation of a large power modulo a prime to a simpler problem.
  -- The Lean proof leverages Lean's computation tactics to formalize this calculation in a concise and direct manner.
