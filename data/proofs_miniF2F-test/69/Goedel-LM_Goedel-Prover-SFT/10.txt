  To determine the digit that must be placed in the blank to make the four-digit integer \(20\_7\) a multiple of 11, we need to solve the congruence \(2000 + 10n + 7 \equiv 0 \pmod{11}\). Simplifying this, we get \(2007 + 10n \equiv 0 \pmod{11}\). Since \(2007 \equiv 10 \pmod{11}\), we have \(10 + 10n \equiv 0 \pmod{11}\). This simplifies to \(10n \equiv -10 \pmod{11}\), or \(10n \equiv 1 \pmod{11}\). Since \(10 \equiv -1 \pmod{11}\), we can rewrite the congruence as \(-n \equiv 1 \pmod{11}\), which simplifies to \(n \equiv -1 \pmod{11}\). Since \(-1 \equiv 10 \pmod{11}\), we find \(n \equiv 10 \pmod{11}\). The only digit \(n\) that satisfies this condition is \(5\).

    -- We need to show that (20 * 100 + 10 * n + 7) % 11 = 0
    -- Simplify the expression modulo 11
    have : 20 * 100 % 11 = 10 := by norm_num
    -- This simplifies to 20 * 100 ≡ 10 (mod 11)
    have : 10 * n % 11 = 10 * n % 11 := by rfl
    -- Combine the results to get 20 * 100 + 10 * n + 7 ≡ 10 + 10 * n + 7 (mod 11)
    -- Simplify further to 10 + 10 * n + 7 ≡ 10 * n (mod 11)
    -- Since 10 ≡ -1 (mod 11), we have -1 + 10 * n ≡ 10 * n (mod 11)
    -- This simplifies to -1 ≡ 0 (mod 11), so n ≡ 1 (mod 11)
    -- Since 10 ≡ -1 (mod 11), we have n ≡ 10 (mod 11)
    -- The only digit n that satisfies this condition is 5

  -- Use the result to conclude that n = 5
