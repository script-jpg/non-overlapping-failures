  To determine the digit that must be placed in the blank to make the four-digit integer \(20\_7\) a multiple of 11, we need to show that the digit is 5. This can be verified by checking the divisibility condition and ensuring that the sum of the digits of the number is congruent to 0 modulo 11.

  -- We start by noting the given conditions.
  have : n ≤ 9 := by assumption
  have : 11 ∣ 20 * 100 + 10 * n + 7 := by assumption
  -- We use interval cases to check each possible value of n from 0 to 9.
  interval_cases n <;> simp_all (config := {decide := true})
  -- By checking each value of n, we find that only n = 5 satisfies the divisibility condition.
  -- Therefore, the digit that must be placed in the blank is 5.
