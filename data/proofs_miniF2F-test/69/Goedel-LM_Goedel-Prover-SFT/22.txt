  To determine the digit \( n \) that must be placed in the blank to make the four-digit integer \( 20\_7 \) a multiple of 11, we need to show that \( n = 5 \). Given that \( n \) is a single digit (0-9) and that \( 20\_7 \) is divisible by 11, we can use the properties of divisibility to find \( n \).
  First, we express \( 20\_7 \) as a number in terms of \( n \):
  \[ 20\_7 = 2000 + 10n + 7 \]
  Since \( 20\_7 \) is divisible by 11, we have:
  \[ 2000 + 10n + 7 \equiv 0 \pmod{11} \]
  We can simplify this congruence:
  \[ 2000 \equiv 1 \pmod{11} \]
  Thus, the congruence becomes:
  \[ 1 + 10n + 7 \equiv 0 \pmod{11} \]
  \[ 10n + 8 \equiv 0 \pmod{11} \]
  \[ 10n \equiv -8 \pmod{11} \]
  \[ 10n \equiv 3 \pmod{11} \]
  Since \( 10 \equiv -1 \pmod{11} \), we can rewrite the congruence as:
  \[ -n \equiv 3 \pmod{11} \]
  \[ n \equiv -3 \pmod{11} \]
  \[ n \equiv 5 \pmod{11} \]
  Given that \( n \) is a single digit (0-9), the only solution is \( n = 5 \).
