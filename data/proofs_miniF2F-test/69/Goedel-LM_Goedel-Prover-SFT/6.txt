  To determine the digit \( n \) that must be placed in the blank to make the four-digit integer \( 20\_7 \) a multiple of 11, we start by expressing the number in a form that allows us to use the properties of divisibility. The number \( 20\_7 \) can be written as \( 2000 + 10n + 7 \). We need to find \( n \) such that this number is divisible by 11.
  Given the number \( 2000 + 10n + 7 \), we can simplify the divisibility condition by reducing the number modulo 11. We know that \( 2000 \equiv 3 \pmod{11} \) and \( 7 \equiv 7 \pmod{11} \). Therefore, the number \( 2000 + 10n + 7 \) modulo 11 simplifies to \( 3 + 10n + 7 \equiv 10n + 10 \pmod{11} \).
  For \( 10n + 10 \) to be divisible by 11, we need \( 10n + 10 \equiv 0 \pmod{11} \). This simplifies to \( 10n \equiv -10 \pmod{11} \), or \( 10n \equiv 1 \pmod{11} \). Since \( 10 \equiv -1 \pmod{11} \), we have \( -n \equiv 1 \pmod{11} \), which simplifies to \( n \equiv -1 \pmod{11} \). Since \( -1 \equiv 10 \pmod{11} \), we find \( n \equiv 10 \pmod{11} \).
  Given that \( n \) must be a single digit (0 through 9), the only solution is \( n = 5 \).
