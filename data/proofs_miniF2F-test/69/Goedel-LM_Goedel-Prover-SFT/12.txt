  To determine the digit that must be placed in the blank to make the four-digit integer \(20\_7\) a multiple of 11, we need to show that it is 5. The given theorem states that for any natural number \(n\) less than or equal to 9, if \(11\) divides \(20 \times 100 + 10 \times n + 7\), then \(n\) must be 5.
  1. Start by rewriting the divisibility condition \(11 \mid 20 \times 100 + 10 \times n + 7\) to \(20 \times 100 + 10 \times n + 7 \equiv 0 \pmod{11}\).
  2. Simplify the expression modulo 11 to find the value of \(n\) that satisfies the condition.
  3. Use the `omega` tactic to solve the resulting linear congruence.
