  To determine the digit that must be placed in the blank to make the four-digit integer \(20\_7\) a multiple of 11, we need to show that the digit must be 5. This can be verified by checking that \(20\_7\) is divisible by 11 for \(n = 5\), and that no other value of \(n\) from 0 to 9 satisfies this condition.

  -- We need to show that n = 5 given the conditions.
  have : n = 5 := by
    -- Use interval_cases to check each possible value of n from 0 to 9.
    interval_cases n <;> simp_all [Nat.mul_succ, Nat.add_assoc]
    -- Use norm_num to simplify the expressions and check divisibility by 11.
    <;> norm_num at h₁ <;> omega
  -- The result follows directly from the checked values.
