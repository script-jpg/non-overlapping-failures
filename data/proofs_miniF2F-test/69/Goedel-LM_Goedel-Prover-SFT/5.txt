  To determine the digit that must be placed in the blank to make the four-digit integer \(20\_7\) a multiple of 11, we need to show that the digit must be 5. We start by expressing the number \(20\_7\) as \(2000 + 10n + 7\), where \(n\) is the digit in the blank. We then use the property that a number is a multiple of 11 if and only if the alternating sum of its digits is divisible by 11. For the number \(20\_7\), the alternating sum is \(2 - 0 + 0 - 7 = -5\). For \(20\_7\) to be a multiple of 11, \(-5\) must be divisible by 11, which is true only when \(n = 5\).

  -- Use the fact that the modulus of the number with 11 is 0 to solve for n
  have : n % 11 = 5 := by
    -- Use the omega tactic to solve the equation 2000 + 10 * n + 7 ≡ 0 (mod 11)

  -- Use the omega tactic to conclude that n must be 5
