  To determine the digit that must be placed in the blank to make the four-digit integer \(20\_7\) a multiple of 11, we start by expressing the integer in the form \(2000 + 10n + 7\). We need to find \(n\) such that the integer is divisible by 11. The condition for divisibility by 11 is given by the equation \(11 \mid 2000 + 10n + 7\).
  First, we simplify the divisibility condition:
  \[ 11 \mid 2000 + 10n + 7 \]
  \[ 11 \mid 2007 + 10n \]
  Next, we use the fact that \(2007 \equiv 0 \pmod{11}\). This implies that \(10n \equiv 0 \pmod{11}\). Since \(10 \equiv -1 \pmod{11}\), we have:
  \[ -n \equiv 0 \pmod{11} \]
  \[ n \equiv 0 \pmod{11} \]
  Given that \(n\) must be a digit (0 through 9) and \(n \equiv 0 \pmod{11}\), the only possible value for \(n\) is 5.
