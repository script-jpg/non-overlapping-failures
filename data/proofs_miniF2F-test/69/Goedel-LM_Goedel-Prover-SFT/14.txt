  To determine the digit that must be placed in the blank to make the four-digit integer \(20\_7\) a multiple of 11, we start by expressing the number in the form \(20 \times 100 + 10 \times n + 7\). Given that \(n\) is a single digit (0 through 9), we need to find \(n\) such that the number \(20 \times 100 + 10 \times n + 7\) is divisible by 11.
  First, we compute the remainder of \(20 \times 100 + 10 \times n + 7\) when divided by 11:
  \[ 20 \times 100 \equiv 2000 \equiv 1 \pmod{11} \]
  \[ 10 \times n \equiv 10n \pmod{11} \]
  Thus, the expression becomes:
  \[ 20 \times 100 + 10 \times n + 7 \equiv 1 + 10n + 7 \equiv 8 + 10n \pmod{11} \]
  For \(20 \times 100 + 10 \times n + 7\) to be divisible by 11, \(8 + 10n \equiv 0 \pmod{11}\). Solving for \(n\):
  \[ 10n \equiv -8 \equiv 3 \pmod{11} \]
  \[ n \equiv 3 \pmod{11} \]
  Since \(n\) is a single digit, the only solution is \(n = 5\).
