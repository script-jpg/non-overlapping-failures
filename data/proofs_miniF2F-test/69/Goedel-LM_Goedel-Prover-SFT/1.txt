  To determine the digit that must be placed in the blank to make the four-digit integer \(20\_7\) a multiple of 11, we start by expressing the number in a form that allows us to use the properties of divisibility. The number \(20\_7\) can be written as \(2000 + 10n + 7\), where \(n\) is a digit (i.e., \(0 \leq n \leq 9\)). We need to find \(n\) such that the number is divisible by 11.
  First, we rewrite the number \(2000 + 10n + 7\) as \(2007 + 10n\). We then use the property that a number is divisible by 11 if the alternating sum of its digits is divisible by 11. For \(2007 + 10n\), the alternating sum is \(2 - 0 + 0 - 7 + 10n = -5 + 10n\). For this to be divisible by 11, we need \(-5 + 10n \equiv 0 \pmod{11}\).
  Simplifying, we get:
  \[
  -5 + 10n \equiv 0 \pmod{11} \implies 10n \equiv 5 \pmod{11} \implies 2n \equiv 5 \pmod{11} \implies 2n = 11k + 5 \quad \text{for some integer } k.
  \]
  Since \(n\) is a digit (i.e., \(0 \leq n \leq 9\)), the only solution that satisfies this condition is \(n = 5\).
