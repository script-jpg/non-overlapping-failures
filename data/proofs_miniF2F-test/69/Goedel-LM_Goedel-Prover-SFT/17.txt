  To determine the digit that must be placed in the blank to make the four-digit integer \(20\_7\) a multiple of 11, we start by expressing the number in the form \(2000 + 100n + 7\). We need to find \(n\) such that \(11\) divides this number. 
  First, we rewrite the divisibility condition:
  \[ 11 \mid (2000 + 100n + 7) \]
  This can be simplified to:
  \[ 11 \mid (2007 + 100n) \]
  Next, we use the property of divisibility to isolate \(n\). We know that \(11\) divides \(2007 + 100n\) if and only if \(11\) divides \(2007\) and \(11\) divides \(100n\). Since \(11\) divides \(2007\) (as \(2007 = 11 \times 182 + 3\)), it suffices to show that \(11\) divides \(100n\).
  Since \(100 = 11 \times 9 + 1\), we can write:
  \[ 100n = (11 \times 9 + 1) \times n = 11 \times (9n) + n \]
  Thus, the condition \(11 \mid 100n\) becomes:
  \[ 11 \mid (11 \times (9n) + n) \]
  This simplifies to:
  \[ 11 \mid 11 \times (9n) + n \]
  Since \(11 \mid 11 \times (9n)\) (by the property of divisibility), it must be that:
  \[ 11 \mid n \]
  Given that \(n\) is a single digit (0 through 9), the only solution is \(n = 5\), as \(11 \mid 5\) is false. Therefore, the digit that must be placed in the blank is 5.
