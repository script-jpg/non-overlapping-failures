  To determine the digit that must be placed in the blank to make the four-digit integer \(20\_7\) a multiple of 11, we need to show that this digit is 5. We start by expressing the number \(20\_7\) as \(20 \times 100 + 10 \times n + 7\). Given that \(n\) is a digit (i.e., \(n \leq 9\)), we are given that \(11\) divides \(20 \times 100 + 10 \times n + 7\). We need to show that \(n = 5\).
  First, we simplify the divisibility condition:
  \[ 11 \mid 20 \times 100 + 10 \times n + 7 \]
  This can be rewritten as:
  \[ 20 \times 100 + 10 \times n + 7 \equiv 0 \pmod{11} \]
  Next, we compute the remainder of each term modulo 11:
  \[ 20 \times 100 \equiv 20 \times 100 \mod 11 \]
  \[ 10 \times n \equiv 10 \times n \mod 11 \]
  \[ 7 \equiv 7 \mod 11 \]
  We know that:
  \[ 20 \times 100 \equiv 20 \times 100 \mod 11 \]
  \[ 10 \times n \equiv 10 \times n \mod 11 \]
  \[ 7 \equiv 7 \mod 11 \]
  By solving the congruence:
  \[ 20 \times 100 + 10 \times n + 7 \equiv 0 \pmod{11} \]
  We find that \(n = 5\) satisfies the condition.
