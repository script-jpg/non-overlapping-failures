-- The rule for divisibility by 11 states that a number is divisible by 11 if and only if the alternating sum of its digits is divisible by 11.
  -- For the four-digit number $20\_7$, the alternating sum is $2 - 0 + 7 = 9$, which is not divisible by 11.
  -- Let the blank digit be $n$. Then, the alternating sum for the number $20n7$ is $2 - 0 + n - 7 = n - 5$.
