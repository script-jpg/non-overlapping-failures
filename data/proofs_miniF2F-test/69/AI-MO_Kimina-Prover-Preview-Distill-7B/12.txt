# Solving the Digit for a Multiple of 11 Problem in Lean 4

To solve the problem of finding the digit that must be placed in the blank to make the number $20\_7$ a multiple of 11, we need to determine the digit $n$ such that $20n7$ is divisible by 11.

First, let's think about how to approach this problem. A number is divisible by 11 if and only if the alternating sum of its digits is divisible by 11. For the number $20n7$, the alternating sum is $2 - 0 + n - 7 = n - 5$. So we need $n - 5 \equiv 0 \pmod{11}$, which means $n \equiv 5 \pmod{11}$.

Since $n$ is a digit (i.e., $0 \leq n \leq 9$), the only value that satisfies $n \equiv 5 \pmod{11}$ is $n = 5$.

Now, let's formalize this in Lean 4:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

We have imported the necessary libraries and opened namespaces for the mathematical tools we'll need. The `maxHeartbeats 0` option allows Lean to use as many computational resources as needed for this proof.

Next, we'll define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_293 (n : ℕ) (h₀ : n ≤ 9) (h₁ : 11 ∣ 20 * 100 + 10 * n + 7) : n = 5 := by
```

We have a natural number $n$ representing the unknown digit, with the constraint that $n \leq 9$ (since it's a digit), and the condition that $11$ divides $2000 + 10n + 7$. This is precisely the condition that $20n7$ is a multiple of 11, as the number $20n7$ can be expressed as $2000 + 10n + 7$.

Now we need to prove that $n = 5$ is the only value satisfying these constraints:

```tactics
have : (2 + n) - (0 + 7) ≥ -6 := by omega
have : (2 + n) - (0 + 7) ≤ 4 := by omega
omega
```

The key insight is that the alternating sum of the digits of $20n7$ is $(2 + n) - (0 + 7) = n - 5$. For divisibility by 11, we need $n - 5 \equiv 0 \pmod{11}$, which means $n \equiv 5 \pmod{11}$. Given that $0 \leq n \leq 9$, the only solution is $n = 5$.

Lean's `omega` tactic is powerful enough to solve arithmetic goals involving natural numbers with constraints. It can deduce that for $n \leq 9$, the only value making $11 \mid (2000 + 10n + 7)$ true is $n = 5$.

To recap why $n = 5$ is the answer: 
- The alternating sum of $2057$ is $2 - 0 + 5 - 7 = 0$, which is divisible by 11
- For other values of $n$ from 0 to 9, the alternating sum is not divisible by 11

Thus, the final answer is $\boxed{5}$.
