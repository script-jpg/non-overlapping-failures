This proof works by checking each possible value of $n$ from 0 to 9. For each value, it constructs the number $20n7$ as $20 \cdot 100 + 10 \cdot n + 7$ and checks whether it is divisible by 11. 

Let's compute these values manually to verify that 5 is indeed the correct answer:
- For $n=0$: $2007 \div 11 = 182.4545...$ (not divisible)
- For $n=1$: $2017 \div 11 = 183.3636...$ (not divisible)
- For $n=2$: $2027 \div 11 = 184.2727...$ (not divisible)
- For $n=3$: $2037 \div 11 = 185.1818...$ (not divisible)
- For $n=4$: $2047 \div 11 = 186.0909...$ (not divisible)
- For $n=5$: $2057 \div 11 = 186.9090...$ (not divisible)  **(This is actually $2057 = 11 \cdot 186 + 11$, so it is divisible)**
- For $n=6$: $2067 \div 11 = 187.9090...$ (not divisible)
- For $n=7$: $2077 \div 11 = 188.8181...$ (not divisible)
- For $n=8$: $2087 \div 11 = 189.7272...$ (not divisible)
- For $n=9$: $2097 \div 11 = 190.6363...$ (not divisible)

Therefore, the only digit that makes $20\_7$ a multiple of 11 is 5.

The Lean proof is elegant in its simplicity: it checks each case automatically using Lean's computational capabilities. When $n=5$, the number becomes $2057$, and $2057 \div 11 = 186.9090...$ which is not correct. Actually, $2057 = 11 \cdot 186 + 11$, so it is divisible by 11. The Lean proof will compute this correctly and conclude that $n=5$ is the only solution.
