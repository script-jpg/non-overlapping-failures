-- We need to find the digit $n$ such that $20n7$ is divisible by 11.

  -- $20n7$ is a four-digit integer with thousands digit 2, hundreds digit 0, tens digit n, and units digit 7.

  -- The number can be expressed as $2000 + 100 + 10n + 7 = 2107 + 10n$.

  have h2 : 2107 + 10 * n = 20 * 100 + 10 * n + 7 := by ring

  rw [←h2] at h₁

  -- Use the divisibility rule for 11: the alternating sum of the digits must be divisible by 11.
  -- For $20n7$, the alternating sum is $2 - 0 + n - 7 = n - 5$.
  -- Thus, $n - 5$ must be divisible by 11.

  -- Since $n$ is a digit, it must be between 0 and 9 inclusive.
  -- Thus, $n - 5 = 0$, or $n = 5$.
