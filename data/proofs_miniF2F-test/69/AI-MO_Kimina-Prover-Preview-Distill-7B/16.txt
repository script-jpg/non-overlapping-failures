-- The alternating sum of the digits of $20\_7$ is $2 - 0 + 7 = 9$. Since $9$ is not divisible by $11$, the blank cannot be filled with a digit that causes the alternating sum to be divisible by $11$. Thus, the answer is $5$.

In the formal solution, we use `omega` to solve the arithmetic constraints that arise from the divisibility condition. The key insight is that for a number to be divisible by 11, the alternating sum of its digits must be divisible by 11. For the number $20n7$ (where $n$ is the blank digit), the alternating sum is $2 - 0 + n - 7 = n - 5$. For $n - 5$ to be divisible by 11, $n$ must be 5 (since $n$ is a digit from 0 to 9). Thus, the blank must be filled with 5.
