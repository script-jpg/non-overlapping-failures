# Finding the Digit for a Number to be a Multiple of 11

To solve this problem, we need to find the digit $n$ such that the number $20n7$ is divisible by 11.

First, let's think about the rule for divisibility by 11. A number is divisible by 11 if the alternating sum of its digits is divisible by 11. For the number $20n7$:

- Odd position digits: 2, 0, 7
- Even position digits: 0, n

The alternating sum is $(2 + 0 + 7) - (0 + n) = 9 - n$.

For $20n7$ to be divisible by 11, $9 - n$ must be divisible by 11.

Now, since $n$ is a digit (0-9), let's find which value of $n$ makes $9 - n$ divisible by 11:

- If $n = 0$, then $9 - 0 = 9$, not divisible by 11
- If $n = 1$, then $9 - 1 = 8$, not divisible by 11
- If $n = 2$, then $9 - 2 = 7$, not divisible by 11
- If $n = 3$, then $9 - 3 = 6$, not divisible by 11
- If $n = 4$, then $9 - 4 = 5$, not divisible by 11
- If $n = 5$, then $9 - 5 = 4$, not divisible by 11
- If $n = 6$, then $9 - 6 = 3$, not divisible by 11
- If $n = 7$, then $9 - 7 = 2$, not divisible by 11
- If $n = 8$, then $9 - 8 = 1$, not divisible by 11
- If $n = 9$, then $9 - 9 = 0$, which is divisible by 11

Wait, actually, let me re-calculate... I made an error in the rule application. The correct rule is that the difference between the sum of odd-positioned digits and the sum of even-positioned digits should be divisible by 11. Let's recalculate:

For the number $20n7$:
- Sum of odd-positioned digits: $2 + 0 + 7 = 9$
- Sum of even-positioned digits: $0 + n = n$
- Difference: $9 - n$ must be divisible by 11

So we need $9 - n \equiv 0 \pmod{11}$, which means $n \equiv 9 \pmod{11}$. Since $n$ is a digit (0-9), the only value satisfying this is $n = 9 - 11 = -2$ (nope, invalid) or $n = 9 - 11 + 11 = 9$ (nope, not -2). Wait, let's think again. The difference $9 - n$ can be negative. So $9 - n \equiv 0 \pmod{11}$ means $n \equiv 9 \pmod{11}$. But $n$ must be in 0-9, so $n = 9 - 11 = -2$ (invalid) or $n = 9 - 11 + 11 = 9$ (still invalid). Wait, no. If $9 - n \equiv 0 \pmod{11}$, then $n \equiv 9 \pmod{11}$. But $n$ is a digit, so $n = 9$ is the only solution. 

But let me verify with the standard divisibility rule: $2097 \div 11 = 190.6363...$, no, that's not an integer. Hmm, let me check my calculation. $2097 \div 11 = 190.6363...$ is indeed not an integer.

Wait, let's try another approach. The correct calculation should be $2000 + 10n + 7 = 2007 + 10n$. We need this to be divisible by 11.

Let's try $n = 5$: $2007 + 10 \cdot 5 = 2007 + 50 = 2057$.

Checking $2057 \div 11$: $2057 \div 11 = 187$, which is an integer! So $n = 5$ is the correct digit.

So where did I go wrong with the alternating sum? The digits are 2, 0, 5, 7. The alternating sum is $(2 + 5) - (0 + 7) = 7 - 7 = 0$, which is divisible by 11. That's correct.

So the digit is 5. Let's complete the formal proof in Lean 4:

theorem mathd_numbertheory_293 (n : ℕ) (h₀ : n ≤ 9) (h₁ : 11 ∣ 20 * 100 + 10 * n + 7) : n = 5 := by
```

We have a natural number n ≤ 9, and 11 divides 2000 + 10n + 7. We need to prove n = 5.

Let's think about how to approach this proof. Since n is bounded by 9, we can check each possible value to find which one satisfies the divisibility condition.

We'll prove this by checking each possible value of n from 0 to 9 and showing that only n = 5 satisfies the divisibility condition.

```tactics
omega
```

The `omega` tactic is powerful for solving arithmetic goals involving natural numbers. It can automatically solve goals involving linear arithmetic constraints over integers and natural numbers. In this case, it will check each value of n from 0 to 9 (due to the constraint n ≤ 9) and verify which one satisfies the divisibility condition 11 ∣ 20 * 100 + 10 * n + 7.

Let's verify manually to confirm:
- n = 0: 2000 + 0 + 7 = 2007; 2007 ÷ 11 = 182.4545...
- n = 1: 2000 + 10 + 7 = 2017; 2017 ÷ 11 = 183.3636...
- n = 2: 2000 + 20 + 7 = 2027; 2027 ÷ 11 = 184.2727...
- n = 3: 2000 + 30 + 7 = 2037; 2037 ÷ 11 = 185.1818...
- n = 4: 2000 + 40 + 7 = 2047; 2047 ÷ 11 = 186.0909...
- n = 5: 2000 + 50 + 7 = 2057; 2057 ÷ 11 = 187 (exact division)
- n = 6: 2000 + 60 + 7 = 2067; 2067 ÷ 11 = 187.9090...
- n = 7: 2000 + 70 + 7 = 2077; 2077 ÷ 11 = 188.8181...
- n = 8: 2000 + 80 + 7 = 2087; 2087 ÷ 11 = 189.7272...
- n = 9: 2000 + 90 + 7 = 2097; 2097 ÷ 11 = 190.6363...

Only when n = 5 does we get an exact division by 11. Thus, the answer is 5.

The Lean proof will automatically check all these cases using the `omega` tactic, which is able to solve arithmetic goals with natural number constraints. It will verify that n = 5 is the only value satisfying both n ≤ 9 and 11 divides 2000 + 10n + 7.

Therefore, the complete proof is simply:
```tactics
omega
```

The beauty of the `omega` tactic is that it can automatically solve goals involving linear arithmetic constraints over integers and natural numbers, which is exactly what we have here: a constraint on n (n ≤ 9) and a divisibility condition (11 divides 2000 + 10n + 7). It will check all possible values of n and confirm that n = 5 is the unique solution.

So our final answer is that the digit 5 must be placed in the blank to make 20_7 a multiple of 11.
