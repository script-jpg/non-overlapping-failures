-- We need to find the digit $n$ such that $20n7$ is divisible by 11.
  -- According to the divisibility rule for 11, the alternating sum of the digits must be divisible by 11.
  -- For $20n7$, the alternating sum is $2 - 0 + n - 7 = 2 + n - 7 = n - 5$.
  -- Therefore, $n - 5$ must be divisible by 11.
  -- Since $n$ is a digit (0-9), the only value that satisfies this is $n = 5$.
  
  -- Convert the number to the form 2000 + 100n + 7
