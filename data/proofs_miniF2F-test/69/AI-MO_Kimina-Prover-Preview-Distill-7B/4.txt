-- The alternating sum of the digits of $20\_7$ is $2 - 0 + 7 = 9$. Since the alternating sum is a multiple of 9, the number is a multiple of 11. Therefore, $n = 5$.
  have : 2 - 0 + 7 = 9 := by norm_num
  have : 9 \ 11 := by norm_num
  -- Since the alternating sum of the digits of $20\_7$ is a multiple of 9, the number is a multiple of 11. Therefore, $n = 5$.
