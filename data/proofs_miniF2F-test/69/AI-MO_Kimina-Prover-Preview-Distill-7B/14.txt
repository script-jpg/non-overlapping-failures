-- We need to find the value of $n$ that makes $20n7$ a multiple of 11.
  -- According to the rule for divisibility by 11, the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions must be a multiple of 11.
  -- For $20n7$, the sum of the digits in the odd positions is $2 + 0 + 7 = 9$ and the sum of the digits in the even positions is $0 + n = n$.
  -- The difference is $9 - n$, which must be a multiple of 11.
  -- Since $0 \leq n \leq 9$, we have $9 - n \in [0,9]$, so $9 - n = 0$ and $n = 9$.
  -- However, this doesn't match the given answer, so let's try another approach.
  -- We can check each digit $0$-$9$ to see which makes $20n7$ divisible by 11.
  -- The number $20n7$ can be expressed as $2000 + 100n + 7 = 2007 + 100n$.
  -- We need $2007 + 100n \equiv 0 \pmod{11}$.
  -- Since $2007 \equiv 2007 \pmod{11}$ and $100 \equiv 1 \pmod{11}$, we have $2007 + 100n \equiv 2007 + n \pmod{11}$.
  -- Calculating $2007 \pmod{11}$: $2007 \div 11 = 182$ remainder $5$, so $2007 \equiv 5 \pmod{11}$.
  -- Thus, $2007 + 100n \equiv 5 + n \pmod{11}$.
  -- We need $5 + n \equiv 0 \pmod{11}$, which means $n \equiv -5 \pmod{11}$.
  -- Since $0 \leq n \leq 9$, the only value satisfying $n \equiv -5 \pmod{11}$ is $n = 6$.
  -- However, this still doesn't match the given answer, so let's try a different approach.
  -- We can check each digit $0$-$9$ to see which makes $20n7$ divisible by 11.
  -- For $n = 0$, $2007 \div 11 = 182$ remainder $5$, so not divisible by 11.
  -- For $n = 1$, $2017 \div 11 = 183$ remainder $4$, so not divisible by 11.
  -- For $n = 2$, $2027 \div 11 = 184$ remainder $3$, so not divisible by 11.
  -- For $n = 3$, $2037 \div 11 = 185$ remainder $2$, so not divisible by 11.
  -- For $n = 4$, $2047 \div 11 = 186$ remainder $1$, so not divisible by 11.
  -- For $n = 5$, $2057 \div 11 = 187$ remainder $0$, so divisible by 11.
  -- For $n = 6$, $2067 \div 11 = 188$ remainder $10$, so not divisible by 11.
  -- For $n = 7$, $2077 \div 11 = 189$ remainder $8$, so not divisible by 11.
  -- For $n = 8$, $2087 \div 11 = 190$ remainder $7$, so not divisible by 11.
  -- For $n = 9$, $2097 \div 11 = 190$ remainder $7$, so not divisible by 11.
  -- Thus, the only value that makes $20n7$ divisible by 11 is $n = 5$.
