-- The rule for divisibility by 11 states that a number is divisible by 11 if and only if the alternating sum of its digits is divisible by 11.

  -- Applying the rule to our number $2007 + 10n$, we calculate the alternating sum of its digits: $2 - 0 + 0 - 7 = -3$.
  have h₃ : 11 ∣ 2007 - 3 := by decide
  have h₄ : 11 ∣ 10 * n - n := by omega
  -- Since $11$ divides both $2007 - 3$ and $10n - n$, it must divide their sum, which is $2007 + 10n - 3 - n = 2004 + 9n$.
  have h₅ : 11 ∣ 2004 + 9 * n := by omega
  clear h₃ h₄

  -- Therefore, $9n$ must be divisible by 11, which means $n$ must be divisible by 11.
  have h₆ : 11 ∣ 9 * n := by omega
  have h₇ : 11 ∣ n := by omega
  clear h₅

  -- Given that $n$ is a digit (0-9), the only value that satisfies $11 \mid n$ is $n = 0$ or $n = 11$. But since $n \leq 9$, we conclude $n = 0$ is not a valid solution, leaving $n = 5$ as the only valid answer.
