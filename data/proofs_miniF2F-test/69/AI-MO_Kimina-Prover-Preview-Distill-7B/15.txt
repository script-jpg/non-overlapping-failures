-- We need to find the digit $n$ such that $20n7$ is divisible by $11$.

  -- $20n7$ is the four-digit integer with thousands digit 2, hundreds digit 0, tens digit n, and units digit 7.

  -- We know that a number is divisible by 11 if and only if the alternating sum of its digits is divisible by 11.

  -- alternating sum of $20n7$ is $2 - 0 + n - 7 = n - 5$.

  have : 2 - 0 + n - 7 = n - 5 := by ring

  -- So $20n7$ is divisible by 11 if and only if $n - 5$ is divisible by 11.

  have (hn : 11 ∣ 20 * 100 + 10 * n + 7) : 11 ∣ n - 5 := by

    -- 20 * 100 + 10 * n + 7 = 2000 + 10n + 7 = 2007 + 10n

    -- We know that $2007 + 10n$ is divisible by 11 if and only if $n - 5$ is divisible by 11.

    have : 20 * 100 + 10 * n + 7 = 2007 + 10 * n := by omega

    -- alternating sum of $2007 + 10n$ is $2 - 0 + 0 - 7 + 10n = 10n - 5$

    have : 2 - 0 + 0 - 7 + 10 * n = 10 * (n - 5) := by ring

    rw [this] at hn

    -- So $10(n - 5)$ is divisible by 11.

    -- But 10 and 11 are coprime, so $n - 5$ is divisible by 11.

  -- Now, since $n$ is a digit, it must be between 0 and 9.

  -- So $n - 5 = 0$, or $n = 5$.
