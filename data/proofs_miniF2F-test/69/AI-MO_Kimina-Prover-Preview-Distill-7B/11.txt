-- We need to find the digit $n$ such that $20n7$ is divisible by $11$.

  -- We will use the divisibility rule for $11$: A number is divisible by $11$ if and only if the alternating sum of its digits is divisible by $11$.

  have h': 2007 + 10 * n = 2007 + 10 * n := rfl
  rw [h'] at h₁
  -- Simplality simplifies the expression.

  have h1: 2007 + 10 * n = 2007 + 10 * n := rfl
  rw [h1] at h₁
  -- Simplicity continues simplifying.

  -- Now, we compute the alternating sum of the digits of $20n7$:
  -- $2 - 0 + n - 7 = 2 - 0 + n - 7 = n - 5$
  -- So $20n7$ is divisible by $11$ if and only if $n - 5$ is divisible by $11$.
