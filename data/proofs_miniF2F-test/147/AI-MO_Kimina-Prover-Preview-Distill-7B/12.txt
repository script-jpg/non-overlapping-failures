-- Compute $91^2$ in your head. Show that it is 8281.
  norm_num
```

The `norm_num` tactic is sufficient to prove this simple arithmetic fact. It will compute $91^2$ and verify that it equals 8281. The informal reason is that $91 \times 91 = 8281$, which can be verified through direct calculation.

Therefore, the complete Lean 4 proof is:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat

theorem mathd_algebra_304 : 91 ^ 2 = 8281 := by
  norm_num
```

This proof is correct and complete. The Lean system will verify that $91^2 = 8281$ using the computational capabilities of the `norm_num` tactic.
