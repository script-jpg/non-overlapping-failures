The `norm_num` tactic is powerful for arithmetic calculations. It will compute $91^2$ directly and check that it equals $8281$. To do this, it likely uses the formula $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$ with $a = 90$ and $b = 1$, or any other method for squaring numbers that's easier to do mentally.

Let's manually verify:
$91^2 = (90+1)^2 = 90^2 + 2 \cdot 90 \cdot 1 + 1^2 = 8100 + 180 + 1 = 8281$

So indeed, $91^2 = 8281$.

This proof demonstrates a basic but important aspect of formal mathematics: computational verification. Even though the problem is simple, it establishes a foundation for more complex calculations and problem-solving. In Lean, the `norm_num` tactic is part of the proof system that allows us to verify arithmetic facts formally, which is crucial for building reliable mathematical proofs.
