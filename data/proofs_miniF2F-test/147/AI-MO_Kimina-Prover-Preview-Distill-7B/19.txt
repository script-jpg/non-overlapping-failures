calc 91 ^ 2 = 91 * 91 := by ring
         _ = 8281 := by norm_num
```

The `calc` environment allows us to show equalities step by step. 

1. First, we rewrite $91^2$ as $91 \cdot 91$ using the `ring` tactic. This is applying the basic algebraic rule that exponentiation means repeated multiplication. 

2. Next, we compute $91 \cdot 91 = 8281$ using the `norm_num` tactic. This tactic is powerful for arithmetic calculations as it can evaluate numerical expressions efficiently. 

So our complete proof is:
- Start with $91^2$
- Rewrite it as $91 \cdot 91$ (using algebraic definition of exponentiation)
- Compute $91 \cdot 91 = 8281$ (using arithmetic)

The Lean proof is remarkably concise because Lean's automation can handle basic arithmetic facts like this one. In a more complex proof, we might need to provide more detailed steps, but for direct computation of concrete numbers, Lean's built-in tactics can verify the equality directly.
