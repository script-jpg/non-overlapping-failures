calc 91 ^ 2 = 91 * 91 := by ring
         _ = 8281 := by norm_num
```

The `calc` block is perfect here as it allows us to show the computation in a step-by-step manner. We first rewrite $91^2$ as $91 \cdot 91$ using the `ring` tactic, which handles basic algebraic manipulations. Then, we compute the actual product using `norm_num`, which is designed to solve arithmetic goals by performing calculations.

So our complete proof is:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

/-- Compute $91^2$ in your head. Show that it is 8281.-/

theorem mathd_algebra_304 : 91 ^ 2 = 8281 := by
  calc 91 ^ 2 = 91 * 91 := by ring
         _ = 8281 := by norm_num
```

This proof is elegant in its simplicity, as it leverages Lean's automation to handle the arithmetic computation that would otherwise require manual calculation steps.
