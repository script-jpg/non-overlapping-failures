The solution expands the square of 91 by first expressing 91 as (90 + 1). It then applies the binomial theorem to expand (90 + 1)^2. The binomial theorem states that (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2. Substituting a = 90 and b = 1, we get:

- a^2 = 90^2 = 8100
- 2ab = 2 * 90 * 1 = 180
- b^2 = 1^2 = 1

Adding these together: 8100 + 180 + 1 = 8281. Therefore, 91^2 = 8281.
