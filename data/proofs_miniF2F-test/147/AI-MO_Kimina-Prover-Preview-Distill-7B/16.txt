--   90² = 8100, right?
  --  (90+1)² = 90² + 2*90*1 + 1² = 8100 + 180 + 1 = 8281
  calc 91 ^ 2 = (90 + 1) ^ 2 := by norm_num
         _ = 90² + 2 * 90 * 1 + 1 ^ 2 := by ring
         _ = 8100 + 180 + 1 := by norm_num
         _ = 8281 := by norm_num
```

In this proof, we use the binomial theorem to expand $(90+1)^2$. The binomial theorem states that $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$. Here, $a = 90$ and $b = 1$. 

1. Calculate $90^2 = 8100$.
2. Calculate $2 \cdot 90 \cdot 1 = 180$.
3. Calculate $1^2 = 1$.
4. Sum these results: $8100 + 180 + 1 = 8281$.

Thus, $91^2 = 8281$.

# Solving the Mathlib Algebra Problem

I'll solve the problem of proving that $91^2 = 8281$ using Lean 4, following the informal calculation steps.

First, I need to import the necessary libraries:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

```

Now I'll state the theorem:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_304 : 91 ^ 2 = 8281 := by
```

To prove this, I'll expand $91^2$ as $(90+1)^2$ and compute each term.

Using the binomial formula $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$ with $a = 90$ and $b = 1$:

- $90^2 = 8100$
- $2 \cdot 90 \cdot 1 = 180$
- $1^2 = 1$

Adding these: $8100 + 180 + 1 = 8281$

In Lean, we can compute this directly using the `norm_num` tactic, which is powerful enough to evaluate arithmetic expressions:

```tactics
norm_num
```

The `norm_num` tactic is sufficient here because it can compute arithmetic goals involving concrete numbers. It will expand $91^2$ to $(90+1)^2$ and compute the result directly, confirming that it equals $8281$.

So our complete proof is:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat

theorem mathd_algebra_304 : 91 ^ 2 = 8281 := by
  norm_num
```

The proof is remarkably concise because the goal is purely computational with concrete values. Lean's `norm_num` tactic can handle this kind of arithmetic calculation automatically, expanding $(90+1)^2$ using the binomial theorem and verifying that the result is indeed $8281$.
