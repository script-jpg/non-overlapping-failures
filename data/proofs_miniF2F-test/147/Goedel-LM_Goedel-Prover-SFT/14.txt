  To compute \(91^2\) in your head, we can use the method of squaring a binomial. Specifically, we can express \(91\) as \(100 - 9\). Then, we can compute the square of \(100 - 9\) as follows:
  \[
  (100 - 9)^2 = 100^2 - 2 \cdot 100 \cdot 9 + 9^2
  \]
  Calculating each term individually:
  \[
  100^2 = 10000
  \]
  \[
  2 \cdot 100 \cdot 9 = 1800
  \]
  \[
  9^2 = 81
  \]
  Combining these results:
  \[
  10000 - 1800 + 81 = 8281
  \]
  Thus, we have shown that \(91^2 = 8281\).
