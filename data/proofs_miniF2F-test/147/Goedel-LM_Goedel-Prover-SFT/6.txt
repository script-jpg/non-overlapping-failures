  To compute \(91^2\) in your head, we can use the following steps:
  1. Express \(91\) as \(90 + 1\).
  2. Use the binomial expansion formula \((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\) where \(a = 90\) and \(b = 1\).
  3. Calculate each term separately:
     - \(90^2 = 8100\)
     - \(2 \cdot 90 \cdot 1 = 180\)
     - \(1^2 = 1\)
  4. Sum these results: \(8100 + 180 + 1 = 8281\).
  Thus, \(91^2 = 8281\).
