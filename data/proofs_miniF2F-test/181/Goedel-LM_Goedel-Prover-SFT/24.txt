  To find \( f(84) \), we need to follow the definition of the function \( f \) for \( n < 1000 \). We will iteratively apply the recursive definition until we reach a value where the initial function simplifies to a numerical value.
  1. Start with \( n = 84 \).
  2. Apply the recursive definition \( f(n) = f(f(n + 5)) \) for \( n < 1000 \).
  3. Continue applying this definition until we reach a value \( n \) such that \( f(n) = n - 3 \).
  By iterating the recursive definition, we can simplify the expression step by step until we reach a point where the initial function \( f \) simplifies to a numerical value.

  -- Apply the recursive definition of f to 84, since 84 < 1000.
  have h₂ := h₁ 84
  -- Apply the recursive definition of f again to the result of the previous step.
  have h₃ := h₁ 84
  -- Apply the recursive definition of f once more to the result of the previous step.
  have h₄ := h₁ 84
  -- Simplify the expression using the initial condition h₀, which states that f(n) = n - 3 for n ≥ 1000.
  simp [h₀] at h₂ h₃ h₄
  -- Normalize the numerical values to confirm the result.
  norm_num at h₂ h₃ h₄
  -- Use the result from the previous step to conclude the final value of f(84).
