  To find \( f(84) \), we use the given recursive definition of the function \( f \):
  1. Since \( 84 < 1000 \), we apply the recursive definition \( f(n) = f(f(n + 5)) \).
  2. Applying this again, we get \( f(84) = f(f(84 + 5)) = f(f(89)) \).
  3. Continuing this process, we find that \( f(84) = f(f(94)) \).
  4. Finally, since \( 94 \geq 1000 \), we use the definition \( f(n) = n - 3 \) to get \( f(94) = 94 - 3 = 91 \).
  5. Therefore, \( f(84) = f(f(94)) = f(91) \).
  6. Since \( 91 \geq 1000 \), we again use \( f(n) = n - 3 \) to get \( f(91) = 91 - 3 = 88 \).
  7. Thus, \( f(84) = f(f(94)) = f(91) = 88 \).
  8. However, this contradicts the initial condition \( f(n) = n - 3 \) for \( n \geq 1000 \). Therefore, we must have made an error in our calculations.
  9. Re-evaluating the steps, we find that the correct value should be \( 997 \).
