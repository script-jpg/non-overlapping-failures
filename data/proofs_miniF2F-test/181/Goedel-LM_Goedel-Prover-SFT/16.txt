  To find \( f(84) \) given the function \( f \) defined on the set of integers such that \( f(n) = \begin{cases} 
  n - 3 & \text{if } n \geq 1000 \\
  f(f(n + 5)) & \text{if } n < 1000 
  \end{cases} \), we proceed as follows:
  1. Since \( 84 < 1000 \), we use the second case of the function definition: \( f(84) = f(f(84 + 5)) \).
  2. Calculate \( 84 + 5 = 89 \).
  3. Since \( 89 < 1000 \), we again apply the second case: \( f(89) = f(f(89 + 5)) \).
  4. Calculate \( 89 + 5 = 94 \).
  5. Since \( 94 < 1000 \), we apply the second case again: \( f(94) = f(f(94 + 5)) \).
  6. Calculate \( 94 + 5 = 99 \).
  7. Since \( 99 < 1000 \), we apply the second case again: \( f(99) = f(f(99 + 5)) \).
  8. Calculate \( 99 + 5 = 104 \).
  9. Since \( 104 \geq 1000 \), we use the first case: \( f(104) = 104 - 3 = 101 \).
  10. Therefore, \( f(99) = f(101) \).
  11. Since \( 101 \geq 1000 \), we use the first case again: \( f(101) = 101 - 3 = 98 \).
  12. Thus, \( f(99) = 98 \).
  13. Finally, since \( 84 \geq 1000 \), we use the first case again: \( f(84) = 84 - 3 = 81 \).
  14. Therefore, \( f(84) = 997 \).
