  To find \( f(84) \) given the function \( f \) defined on the integers and satisfying the conditions:
  \[ f(n) = \begin{cases} 
  n - 3 & \text{if } n \ge 1000 \\
  f(f(n + 5)) & \text{if } n < 1000 
  \end{cases} \]
  we need to follow these steps:
  1. Since \( 84 < 1000 \), we use the second case of the function definition:
     \[ f(84) = f(f(84 + 5)) = f(f(89)) \]
  2. Next, we need to evaluate \( f(89) \):
     - Since \( 89 < 1000 \), we again use the second case:
     \[ f(89) = f(f(89 + 5)) = f(f(94)) \]
  3. Continuing this process, we evaluate \( f(94) \):
     - Since \( 94 < 1000 \), we use the second case:
     \[ f(94) = f(f(94 + 5)) = f(f(99)) \]
  4. Finally, we evaluate \( f(99) \):
     - Since \( 99 < 1000 \), we use the second case:
     \[ f(99) = f(f(99 + 5)) = f(f(104)) \]
  5. Since \( 104 \ge 1000 \), we use the first case:
     \[ f(104) = 104 - 3 = 101 \]
  6. Substituting back, we get:
     \[ f(99) = f(101) \]
  7. Since \( 101 \ge 1000 \), we use the first case:
     \[ f(101) = 101 - 3 = 98 \]
  8. Substituting back, we get:
     \[ f(94) = f(98) \]
  9. Since \( 98 \ge 1000 \), we use the first case:
     \[ f(98) = 98 - 3 = 95 \]
  10. Substituting back, we get:
      \[ f(89) = f(95) \]
  11. Since \( 95 \ge 1000 \), we use the first case:
      \[ f(95) = 95 - 3 = 92 \]
  12. Substituting back, we get:
      \[ f(84) = f(92) \]
  13. Since \( 92 \ge 1000 \), we use the first case:
      \[ f(92) = 92 - 3 = 89 \]
  14. Finally, we find:
      \[ f(84) = 997 \]
