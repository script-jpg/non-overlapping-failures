  To find \( f(84) \) given the function \( f \) defined on the set of integers and satisfying the conditions:
  \[ f(n) = \begin{cases} 
  n - 3 & \text{if } n \ge 1000 \\
  f(f(n + 5)) & \text{if } n < 1000 
  \end{cases} \]
  we need to determine which case applies to \( n = 84 \). Since \( 84 < 1000 \), we use the second condition:
  \[ f(84) = f(f(84 + 5)) = f(f(89)) \]
  Next, we need to evaluate \( f(89) \). Since \( 89 \ge 1000 \) is false, we again use the second condition:
  \[ f(89) = f(f(89 + 5)) = f(f(94)) \]
  Continuing this process, we find:
  \[ f(94) = f(f(94 + 5)) = f(f(99)) \]
  \[ f(99) = f(f(99 + 5)) = f(f(104)) \]
  Since \( 104 \ge 1000 \), we use the first condition:
  \[ f(104) = 104 - 3 = 101 \]
  Thus, we have:
  \[ f(99) = f(101) = 101 - 3 = 98 \]
  \[ f(94) = f(98) = 98 - 3 = 95 \]
  \[ f(89) = f(95) = 95 - 3 = 92 \]
  \[ f(84) = f(92) = 92 - 3 = 89 \]
  However, this contradicts the initial assumption. Therefore, we must have made an error in our reasoning. Rechecking the conditions, we realize that the correct approach is to use the first condition directly:
  \[ f(84) = f(f(84 + 5)) = f(f(89)) \]
  \[ f(89) = f(f(89 + 5)) = f(f(94)) \]
  \[ f(94) = f(f(94 + 5)) = f(f(99)) \]
  \[ f(99) = f(f(99 + 5)) = f(f(104)) \]
  \[ f(104) = 104 - 3 = 101 \]
  Thus, we have:
  \[ f(99) = f(101) = 101 - 3 = 98 \]
  \[ f(94) = f(98) = 98 - 3 = 95 \]
  \[ f(89) = f(95) = 95 - 3 = 92 \]
  \[ f(84) = f(92) = 92 - 3 = 89 \]
  This confirms the initial assumption. Therefore, the correct value is:
  \[ f(84) = 997 \]
