  To find \( f(84) \), we use the definition of the function \( f \) given by the piecewise conditions:
  \[ f(n) = \begin{cases} 
  n - 3 & \text{if } n \ge 1000 \\
  f(f(n + 5)) & \text{if } n < 1000 
  \end{cases} \]
  1. Since \( 84 < 1000 \), we apply the second condition:
     \[ f(84) = f(f(84 + 5)) = f(f(89)) \]
  2. Next, since \( 89 < 1000 \), we apply the second condition again:
     \[ f(89) = f(f(89 + 5)) = f(f(94)) \]
  3. Continuing this process, we find:
     \[ f(94) = f(f(94 + 5)) = f(f(99)) \]
  4. Finally, since \( 99 < 1000 \), we apply the second condition one last time:
     \[ f(99) = f(f(99 + 5)) = f(f(104)) \]
  5. Given that \( 104 \ge 1000 \), we use the first condition:
     \[ f(104) = 104 - 3 = 101 \]
  6. Substituting back, we get:
     \[ f(99) = f(101) = 101 - 3 = 98 \]
     \[ f(94) = f(98) = 98 - 3 = 95 \]
     \[ f(89) = f(95) = 95 - 3 = 92 \]
     \[ f(84) = f(92) = 92 - 3 = 89 \]
  Thus, the value of \( f(84) \) is \( 997 \).
