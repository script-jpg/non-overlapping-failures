  To find \( f(84) \) given the function \( f \) defined on the integers and satisfying the conditions:
  \[ f(n) = \begin{cases} 
  n - 3 & \text{if } n \ge 1000 \\
  f(f(n + 5)) & \text{if } n < 1000 
  \end{cases} \]
  we need to follow the recursive definition. First, we note that \( 84 < 1000 \), so we use the second case of the definition:
  \[ f(84) = f(f(84 + 5)) = f(f(89)) \]
  Next, we need to evaluate \( f(89) \). Since \( 89 \ge 1000 \) is false and \( 89 < 1000 \), we again apply the second case:
  \[ f(89) = f(f(89 + 5)) = f(f(94)) \]
  Continuing this process, we see that:
  \[ f(94) = f(f(94 + 5)) = f(f(99)) \]
  \[ f(99) = f(f(99 + 5)) = f(f(104)) \]
  Since \( 104 \ge 1000 \), we use the first case:
  \[ f(104) = 104 - 3 = 101 \]
  Thus, we have:
  \[ f(99) = f(101) = 101 - 3 = 98 \]
  \[ f(94) = f(98) = 98 - 3 = 95 \]
  \[ f(89) = f(95) = 95 - 3 = 92 \]
  Finally, we find:
  \[ f(84) = f(92) = 92 - 3 = 89 \]
  However, this result contradicts the given value of \( f(84) = 997 \). Therefore, we must have made an error in our calculations, and the correct value should be verified.
