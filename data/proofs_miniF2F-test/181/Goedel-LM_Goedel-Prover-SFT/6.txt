  To find \( f(84) \), we need to follow the recursive definition of \( f \):
  1. Since \( 84 < 1000 \), we use the second part of the definition:
     \[
     f(84) = f(f(84 + 5)) = f(f(89))
     \]
  2. Next, we need to determine \( f(89) \):
     \[
     f(89) = f(f(89 + 5)) = f(f(94))
     \]
  3. Continuing this process:
     \[
     f(94) = f(f(94 + 5)) = f(f(99))
     \]
  4. Finally, we reach:
     \[
     f(99) = f(f(99 + 5)) = f(f(104))
     \]
  5. Since \( 104 \geq 1000 \), we use the first part of the definition:
     \[
     f(104) = 104 - 3 = 101
     \]
  6. Therefore:
     \[
     f(99) = f(101) = 101 - 3 = 98
     \]
  7. Continuing back:
     \[
     f(94) = f(98) = 98 - 3 = 95
     \]
  8. Continuing back:
     \[
     f(89) = f(95) = 95 - 3 = 92
     \]
  9. Continuing back:
     \[
     f(84) = f(92) = 92 - 3 = 89
     \]
  However, this process seems incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the steps carefully.
