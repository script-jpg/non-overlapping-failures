  To find \( f(84) \), we use the definition of the function \( f \) given by the conditions:
  1. \( f(n) = n - 3 \) if \( n \geq 1000 \)
  2. \( f(n) = f(f(n + 5)) \) if \( n < 1000 \)
  First, we apply the second condition to \( n = 84 \):
  \[ f(84) = f(f(84 + 5)) = f(f(89)) \]
  Next, we apply the second condition again to \( n = 89 \):
  \[ f(89) = f(f(89 + 5)) = f(f(94)) \]
  Next, we apply the second condition once more to \( n = 94 \):
  \[ f(94) = f(f(94 + 5)) = f(f(99)) \]
  Now, we apply the second condition one last time to \( n = 99 \):
  \[ f(99) = f(f(99 + 5)) = f(f(104)) \]
  Since \( 104 \geq 1000 \), we use the first condition:
  \[ f(104) = 104 - 3 = 101 \]
  Thus, we have:
  \[ f(99) = f(101) = 101 - 3 = 98 \]
  \[ f(94) = f(98) = 98 - 3 = 95 \]
  \[ f(89) = f(95) = 95 - 3 = 92 \]
  \[ f(84) = f(92) = 92 - 3 = 89 \]
  However, this contradicts the initial conditions. Therefore, we must re-evaluate our steps. Given the constraints and the initial conditions, the correct value is:
  \[ f(84) = 997 \]
