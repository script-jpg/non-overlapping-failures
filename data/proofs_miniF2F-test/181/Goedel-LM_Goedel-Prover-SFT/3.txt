  To find \( f(84) \) given the function \( f \) defined on the integers and satisfying the conditions:
  \[ f(n) = \begin{cases} 
  n - 3 & \text{if } n \ge 1000 \\
  f(f(n + 5)) & \text{if } n < 1000 
  \end{cases} \]
  we proceed as follows:
  1. Since \( 84 < 1000 \), we use the second condition to get:
     \[ f(84) = f(f(84 + 5)) = f(f(89)) \]
  2. Next, we need to evaluate \( f(89) \):
     \[ 89 \ge 1000 \text{ is false, so we use the second condition again: } f(89) = f(f(89 + 5)) = f(f(94)) \]
  3. Continuing this process, we evaluate \( f(94) \):
     \[ 94 \ge 1000 \text{ is false, so we use the second condition again: } f(94) = f(f(94 + 5)) = f(f(99)) \]
  4. Finally, we evaluate \( f(99) \):
     \[ 99 \ge 1000 \text{ is false, so we use the second condition again: } f(99) = f(f(99 + 5)) = f(f(104)) \]
  Since \( 104 \ge 1000 \), we use the first condition:
  \[ f(104) = 104 - 3 = 101 \]
  Thus, we have:
  \[ f(99) = f(101) \]
  Since \( 101 \ge 1000 \), we use the first condition again:
  \[ f(101) = 101 - 3 = 98 \]
  Therefore:
  \[ f(99) = 98 \]
  Finally, we have:
  \[ f(84) = f(98) \]
  Since \( 98 \ge 1000 \), we use the first condition again:
  \[ f(98) = 98 - 3 = 95 \]
  Thus, we have:
  \[ f(84) = 95 \]
