-- Find the units digit of $29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81$. Show that it is 2.

  -- Break down the goal into smaller subgoals.

  -- First, we have $29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81 = 5100 + 2499 + 1 = 7600$

  have eq : 29 * 79 + 31 * 81 = 7600 := by

    -- This subgoal can be proved by hand calculation.

    norm_num

  -- Then, we have $7600 \equiv 2 \pmod {10}$

  rw [eq]
