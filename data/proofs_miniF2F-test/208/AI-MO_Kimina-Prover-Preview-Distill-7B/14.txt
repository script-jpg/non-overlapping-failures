The Lean proof is remarkably concise because Lean's computational capabilities can directly evaluate the arithmetic expression. The `norm_num` tactic is powerful enough to compute the exact value of the expression $29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81$ and then compute its remainder when divided by 10.

Let's compute this manually to verify:

- $29 \cdot 79 = 29 \cdot (80 - 1) = 29 \cdot 80 - 29 = 2320 - 29 = 2291$
- $31 \cdot 81 = 31 \cdot (80 + 1) = 31 \cdot 80 + 31 = 2480 + 31 = 2511$
- Sum: $2291 + 2511 = 4802$
- $4802 \bmod 10 = 2$

So indeed, the units digit is 2.

In Lean 3, the proof would proceed as follows:
1. The goal is to prove that $(29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81) \bmod 10 = 2$
2. Lean's `norm_num` tactic will compute the arithmetic expression
3. It will calculate $29 \cdot 79 = 2291$
4. It will calculate $31 \cdot 81 = 2511$
5. It will calculate $2291 + 2511 = 4802$
6. It will calculate $4802 \bmod 10 = 2$
7. Since the computed value equals the expected value, the proof is complete

Therefore, the Lean proof is correct and complete. The units digit of $29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81$ is indeed 2.
