-- Find the units digit of $29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81$. Show that it is 2.

  -- Step 1: Calculate the units digit of 29 * 79
  -- The units digit of 29 is 9, and the units digit of 79 is 9.
  -- The units digit of 9 * 9 is 1 (since 9 * 9 = 81)
  have h1 : (29 * 79) % 10 = 1 := by norm_num

  -- Step 2: Calculate the units digit of 31 * 81
  -- The units digit of 31 is 1, and the units digit of 81 is 1.
  -- The units digit of 1 * 1 is 1 (since 1 * 1 = 1)
  have h2 : (31 * 81) % 10 = 1 := by norm_num

  -- Step 3: Calculate the units digit of the sum
  -- The units digit of 1 + 1 is 2 (since 1 + 1 = 2)
  have h3 : (1 + 1) % 10 = 2 := by norm_num

  -- Combine the results
  calc (29 * 79 + 31 * 81) % 10
      = ((29 * 79) % 10 + (31 * 81) % 10) % 10 := by
        simp [Nat.add_mod, Nat.mul_mod]
      _ = (1 + 1) % 10 := by rw [h1, h2]
      _ = 2 := by rw [h3]
