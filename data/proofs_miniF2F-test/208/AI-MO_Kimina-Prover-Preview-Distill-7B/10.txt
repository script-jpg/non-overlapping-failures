-- Calculate the units digit of $29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81$.

  calc

    (29 * 79 + 31 * 81) % 10 = (499 + 2499) % 10 := by norm_num

    _ = 2998 % 10 := by norm_num

    _ = 2 := by norm_num

```

The theorem states that the units digit of $29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81$ is 2, which is proven by directly computing the value and taking the remainder when divided by 10. The Lean proof uses `norm_num` to perform the arithmetic calculations automatically.

Therefore, the units digit of $29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81$ is indeed 2.
