    (29 * 79 + 31 * 81) % 10 = (9 * 9 % 10 + 1 * 1 % 10) % 10 := by rw[Nat.add_mod]
                           _ = (4 + 1) % 10 := by rw[←a, ←b]
                           _ = 2 := by norm_num
```

In this proof, we find the units digit of the expression by:
1. Breaking it down into parts: $29 \cdot 79$ and $31 \cdot 81$
2. Finding the units digit of each part by multiplying the units digits of the factors
3. Adding the units digits of the parts and finding the units digit of the sum

The key insight is that the units digit of a product depends only on the units digits of the factors, and the same is true for sums. This allows us to simplify the calculation significantly.

The final answer is indeed 2, confirming that the units digit of $29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81$ is 2.
