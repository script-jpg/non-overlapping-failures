The proof is straightforward. We need to find the units digit of the expression $29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81$ and show that it equals 2. In number theory, the units digit of a number is equivalent to the number modulo 10. 

Let's break this down step by step:

1. We need to compute $(29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81) \bmod 10$.
2. First, calculate $29 \cdot 79 \bmod 10$:
   - The units digit of 29 is 9
   - The units digit of 79 is 9
   - The units digit of $9 \cdot 9 = 81$ is 1
   - So $29 \cdot 79 \bmod 10 = 1$
3. Next, calculate $31 \cdot 81 \bmod 10$:
   - The units digit of 31 is 1
   - The units digit of 81 is 1
   - The units digit of $1 \cdot 1 = 1$ is 1
   - So $31 \cdot 81 \bmod 10 = 1$
4. Add the two results: $1 + 1 = 2$
5. Therefore, $(29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81) \bmod 10 = 2$

In Lean 4, the `norm_num` tactic is powerful enough to compute arithmetic goals directly. It will:
1. Compute $29 \cdot 79 = 2291$
2. Compute $31 \cdot 81 = 2511$
3. Add them: $2291 + 2511 = 4802$
4. Compute $4802 \bmod 10 = 2$
5. Verify that indeed, the units digit is 2

So our complete proof is:

theorem mathd_numbertheory_235 : (29 * 79 + 31 * 81) % 10 = 2 := by 
  norm_num
```

This proof is complete! The `norm_num` tactic is able to compute the exact value of the expression and then compute its remainder when divided by 10, confirming that it equals 2.
