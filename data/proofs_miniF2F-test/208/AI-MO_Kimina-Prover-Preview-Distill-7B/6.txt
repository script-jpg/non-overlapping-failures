In this Lean 4 solution, we're tasked with finding the units digit of the expression $29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81$. The units digit of a number is its remainder when divided by 10. 

The Lean proof is remarkably concise because Lean's computational engine can directly evaluate arithmetic expressions. The `norm_num` tactic is powerful for arithmetic goals. It will:
1. Compute the products $29 \cdot 79$ and $31 \cdot 81$
2. Add the results
3. Calculate the remainder when divided by 10
4. Verify that this equals 2

Let's manually verify this as well to understand what Lean is computing:

- $29 \cdot 79 = 2291$
- $31 \cdot 81 = 2511$
- Sum: $2291 + 2511 = 4802$
- Units digit: $4802 \bmod 10 = 2$

So indeed, the units digit is 2. Lean's `norm_num` tactic is able to compute this directly, which is why the complete formal proof is just one line.

The `norm_num` tactic is handling all the arithmetic for us, which is appropriate for this kind of computational problem. It's Lean's way of saying "compute this arithmetic expression and verify it equals the claimed value."

Therefore, our complete formal proof is:

theorem mathd_numbertheory_235 : (29 * 79 + 31 * 81) % 10 = 2 := by 
  norm_num
```

This proof is complete and correct. It directly computes the value of the expression and confirms it equals 2 modulo 10, which is precisely the units digit of the number.
