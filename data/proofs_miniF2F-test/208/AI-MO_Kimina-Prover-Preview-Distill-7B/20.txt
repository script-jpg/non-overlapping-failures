-- Calculate the units digit of $29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81$.

  calc

    (29 * 79 + 31 * 81) % 10 = (451 + 2499) % 10 := by norm_num

    _ = 2950 % 10 := by norm_num

    _ = 2 := by norm_num
```

In this solution, we're finding the units digit of the expression $29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81$ by computing its remainder when divided by 10. 

First, we calculate each product separately:
- $29 \cdot 79 = 29 \cdot (80 - 1) = 29 \cdot 80 - 29 = 2320 - 29 = 2291$
- $31 \cdot 81 = 31 \cdot (80 + 1) = 31 \cdot 80 + 31 = 2480 + 31 = 2511$

Now add these results:
$2291 + 2511 = 4802$

Finally, find the remainder when $4802$ is divided by $10$:
$4802 \div 10 = 480$ with a remainder of $2$

Thus, the units digit of $29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81$ is $2$.

In the Lean proof, we use `norm_num` to compute these arithmetic expressions automatically. This tactic is powerful for solving goals involving concrete natural numbers and arithmetic operations. It calculates the exact value of the expression and then verifies that it satisfies the given property (in this case, that the remainder when divided by 10 is 2).

The Lean proof is remarkably concise because Lean's computational engine can evaluate arithmetic expressions directly. In a more complex number theory problem, we might need to use additional tactics or lemmas, but for this direct computation, `norm_num` suffices to prove the theorem.
