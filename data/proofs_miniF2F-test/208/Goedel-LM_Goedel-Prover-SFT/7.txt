  To find the units digit of \(29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81\), we need to determine the units digits of the individual products and then sum them up, focusing on the units digits of the results.
  1. The units digit of \(29\) is \(9\).
  2. The units digit of \(79\) is \(9\).
  3. The units digit of \(31\) is \(1\).
  4. The units digit of \(81\) is \(1\).
  First, we calculate the units digit of \(29 \cdot 79\):
  - The units digit of \(9 \cdot 9\) is \(1\) (since \(9 \cdot 9 = 81\)).
  Next, we calculate the units digit of \(31 \cdot 81\):
  - The units digit of \(1 \cdot 1\) is \(1\) (since \(1 \cdot 1 = 1\)).
  Adding these units digits together:
  - \(1 + 1 = 2\).
  Thus, the units digit of \(29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81\) is \(2\).
