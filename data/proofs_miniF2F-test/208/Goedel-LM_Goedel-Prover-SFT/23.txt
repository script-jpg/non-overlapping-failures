  To find the units digit of \(29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81\), we need to compute the expression modulo 10. First, we calculate the units digits of the individual products and then sum them up, taking the units digit of the result.
  1. The units digit of \(29 \cdot 79\) is the same as the units digit of \(9 \cdot 9\) because \(29 \equiv 9 \pmod{10}\) and \(79 \equiv 9 \pmod{10}\).
  2. The units digit of \(31 \cdot 81\) is the same as the units digit of \(1 \cdot 1\) because \(31 \equiv 1 \pmod{10}\) and \(81 \equiv 1 \pmod{10}\).
  3. The units digit of \(9 \cdot 9\) is 1.
  4. The units digit of \(1 \cdot 1\) is 1.
  5. Adding these units digits, we get \(1 + 1 = 2\).
  Thus, the units digit of \(29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81\) is 2.
