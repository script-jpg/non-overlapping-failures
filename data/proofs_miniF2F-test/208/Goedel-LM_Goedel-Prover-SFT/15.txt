  To find the units digit of \(29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81\) and show that it is 2, we can simplify the problem by focusing on the units digits of the individual multiplications. The units digit of \(29 \cdot 79\) is the same as the units digit of \(9 \cdot 9\), and similarly, the units digit of \(31 \cdot 81\) is the same as the units digit of \(1 \cdot 1\). Adding these units digits together and then finding the units digit of the result will give us the desired units digit.
