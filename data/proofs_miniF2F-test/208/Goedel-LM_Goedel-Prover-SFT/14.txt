  To find the units digit of \(29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81\) and show that it is 2, we can follow these steps:
  1. Calculate the units digits of the individual products:
     - The units digit of \(29 \cdot 79\) is the same as the units digit of \(9 \cdot 9\) because the units digit of 29 is 9 and the units digit of 79 is 9.
     - The units digit of \(31 \cdot 81\) is the same as the units digit of \(1 \cdot 1\) because the units digit of 31 is 1 and the units digit of 81 is 1.
  2. Multiply the units digits:
     - The units digit of \(9 \cdot 9\) is 1 (since \(9 \cdot 9 = 81\)).
     - The units digit of \(1 \cdot 1\) is 1.
  3. Add the units digits:
     - The units digit of \(1 + 1\) is 2.
  Thus, the units digit of \(29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81\) is 2.
