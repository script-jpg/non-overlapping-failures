  To find the units digit of \(29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81\), we can focus on the units digits of the individual products and their sum. The units digit of \(29 \cdot 79\) is determined by the units digits of 29 and 79, which are 9 and 9 respectively. Thus, the units digit of \(29 \cdot 79\) is \(9 \cdot 9 = 81\), so the units digit is 1.
  Similarly, the units digit of \(31 \cdot 81\) is determined by the units digits of 31 and 81, which are 1 and 1 respectively. Thus, the units digit of \(31 \cdot 81\) is \(1 \cdot 1 = 1\).
  Adding these units digits together, we get \(1 + 1 = 2\). Therefore, the units digit of \(29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81\) is 2.

  -- Calculate the units digit of 29 * 79 by focusing on the units digits of 29 and 79.
  -- The units digit of 29 * 79 is 1 (since 9 * 9 = 81).
  -- Calculate the units digit of 31 * 81 by focusing on the units digits of 31 and 81.
  -- The units digit of 31 * 81 is 1 (since 1 * 1 = 1).
  -- Adding these units digits together, we get 1 + 1 = 2.
