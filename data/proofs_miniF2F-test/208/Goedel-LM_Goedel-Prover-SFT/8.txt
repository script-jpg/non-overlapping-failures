  To find the units digit of \(29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81\), we need to compute the expression modulo 10. We start by calculating the units digit of each term separately and then combining the results.
  1. The units digit of \(29\) is \(9\).
  2. The units digit of \(79\) is \(9\).
  3. The units digit of \(31\) is \(1\).
  4. The units digit of \(81\) is \(1\).
  Next, we compute the units digit of the products:
  - The units digit of \(9 \cdot 9\) is \(1\).
  - The units digit of \(1 \cdot 1\) is \(1\).
  Adding these results together:
  - The units digit of \(1 + 1\) is \(2\).
  Thus, the units digit of \(29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81\) is \(2\).
