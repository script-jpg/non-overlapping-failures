  To find the units digit of \(29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81\), we need to compute the expression modulo 10. We start by calculating the units digits of the individual products:
  1. The units digit of \(29\) is \(9\).
  2. The units digit of \(79\) is \(9\).
  3. The units digit of \(31\) is \(1\).
  4. The units digit of \(81\) is \(1\).
  Next, we compute the units digits of the products:
  1. The units digit of \(29 \cdot 79\) is the same as the units digit of \(9 \cdot 9\), which is \(1\).
  2. The units digit of \(31 \cdot 81\) is the same as the units digit of \(1 \cdot 1\), which is \(1\).
  Adding these units digits:
  \[ 1 + 1 = 2 \]
  Thus, the units digit of \(29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81\) is \(2\).
