  To find the units digit of \(29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81\), we need to compute the expression modulo 10. We observe that the units digit of each number is the remainder when the number is divided by 10. Therefore, we can simplify the problem by considering only the units digits of the numbers involved.
  1. The units digit of 29 is 9.
  2. The units digit of 79 is 9.
  3. The units digit of 31 is 1.
  4. The units digit of 81 is 1.
  Thus, the expression \(29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81\) modulo 10 can be simplified to \(9 \cdot 9 + 1 \cdot 1\) modulo 10.
  Calculating this:
  \[ 9 \cdot 9 = 81 \]
  \[ 81 \mod 10 = 1 \]
  \[ 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \]
  \[ 1 \mod 10 = 1 \]
  Adding these results:
  \[ 1 + 1 = 2 \]
  Therefore, the units digit of \(29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81\) is 2.

  -- Simplify the expression modulo 10 by considering only the units digits.
  -- The units digit of 29 is 9, and the units digit of 79 is 9.
  -- The units digit of 31 is 1, and the units digit of 81 is 1.
  -- Thus, the expression simplifies to 9 * 9 + 1 * 1 modulo 10.
