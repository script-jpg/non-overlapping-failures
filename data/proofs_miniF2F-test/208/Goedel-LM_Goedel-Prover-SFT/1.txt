  To find the units digit of \(29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81\), we need to compute the expression modulo 10. First, we calculate the units digits of the individual products:
  - The units digit of \(29 \cdot 79\) is the same as \(9 \cdot 9\) because the units digit of 29 is 9 and the units digit of 79 is 9.
  - The units digit of \(31 \cdot 81\) is the same as \(1 \cdot 1\) because the units digit of 31 is 1 and the units digit of 81 is 1.
  Next, we compute the sum of these units digits:
  - The units digit of \(9 \cdot 9\) is 1.
  - The units digit of \(1 \cdot 1\) is 1.
  Adding these units digits together:
  - \(1 + 1 = 2\).
  Thus, the units digit of \(29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81\) is 2.

  -- Calculate the units digit of 29 * 79 by reducing modulo 10
  -- The units digit of 29 is 9, and the units digit of 79 is 9, so we use 9 * 9
