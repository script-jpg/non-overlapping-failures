  To find the units digit of \(29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81\), we need to compute the expression modulo 10. We will show that the units digit is 2.
  First, we calculate the units digit of each term separately:
  1. The units digit of \(29 \cdot 79\) is \(9 \cdot 9 = 81\), so the units digit is 1.
  2. The units digit of \(31 \cdot 81\) is \(1 \cdot 1 = 1\), so the units digit is 1.
  Adding these two results together:
  \[1 + 1 = 2\]
  Thus, the units digit of \(29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81\) is 2.

  -- Calculate the units digit of 29 * 79 and 31 * 81 separately by reducing modulo 10.
  norm_num [Nat.mul_mod, (by decide : 10 = 10)]
  -- Use norm_num to simplify the expression modulo 10.
  -- This will directly compute the units digit of the entire expression.
  -- The result is 2, as shown in the translated proof above.
