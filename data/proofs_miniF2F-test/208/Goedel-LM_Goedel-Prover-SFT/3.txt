  To find the units digit of \(29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81\), we need to compute the expression modulo 10. First, we calculate the units digit of each term separately. The units digit of \(29\) is \(9\), and the units digit of \(79\) is \(9\). Thus, the units digit of \(29 \cdot 79\) is \(9 \cdot 9 = 81\), which has a units digit of \(1\).
  Next, the units digit of \(31\) is \(1\), and the units digit of \(81\) is \(1\). Therefore, the units digit of \(31 \cdot 81\) is \(1 \cdot 1 = 1\).
  Adding these results together, the units digit of \(29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81\) is \(1 + 1 = 2\).
