  To find the units digit of \(29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81\), we can focus on the units digits of the individual products. The units digit of \(29\) is \(9\), and the units digit of \(79\) is \(9\). Therefore, the units digit of \(29 \cdot 79\) is the same as the units digit of \(9 \cdot 9\), which is \(1\).
  Similarly, the units digit of \(31\) is \(1\), and the units digit of \(81\) is \(1\). Therefore, the units digit of \(31 \cdot 81\) is the same as the units digit of \(1 \cdot 1\), which is \(1\).
  Adding these units digits together, we get \(1 + 1 = 2\).
  Thus, the units digit of \(29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81\) is \(2\).

  -- Calculate the units digit of the product 29 * 79
  have h1 : 29 * 79 % 10 = 9 * 9 % 10 := by
    -- The units digit of 29 is 9 and the units digit of 79 is 9, so we need to find the units digit of 9 * 9
    simp
  -- Calculate the units digit of the product 31 * 81
  have h2 : 31 * 81 % 10 = 1 * 1 % 10 := by
    -- The units digit of 31 is 1 and the units digit of 81 is 1, so we need to find the units digit of 1 * 1
    simp
  -- Combine the results using the calculated units digits
