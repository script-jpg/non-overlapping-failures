  To find the units digit of \(29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81\), we need to compute the expression modulo 10. We start by calculating the units digits of the individual products and then summing them. The units digit of \(29\) is \(9\), and the units digit of \(79\) is \(9\). Thus, the units digit of \(29 \cdot 79\) is \(9 \cdot 9 = 81\), which has a units digit of \(1\). Similarly, the units digit of \(31 \cdot 81\) is \(1 \cdot 1 = 1\). Adding these units digits together, we get \(1 + 1 = 2\). Therefore, the units digit of \(29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81\) is \(2\).

  -- We use `norm_num` to compute the units digit of the expression.
  -- First, we show that the units digit of 29 is 9 and the units digit of 79 is 9.
