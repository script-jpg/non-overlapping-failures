  To find the units digit of the expression \(29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81\), we can focus on the units digits of the individual terms. The units digit of \(29\) is \(9\), and the units digit of \(79\) is \(9\). Similarly, the units digit of \(31\) is \(1\), and the units digit of \(81\) is \(1\). Therefore, we need to compute the units digit of \(9 \cdot 9 + 1 \cdot 1\). This results in \(81 + 1 = 82\), and the units digit of \(82\) is \(2\).

  -- We only need the units digit of the result, so we can use `norm_num` to simplify the expression modulo 10.
  norm_num [Nat.ModEq, Nat.add_mod]
  -- The `norm_num` tactic will compute the units digit of the expression and verify that it is 2.
