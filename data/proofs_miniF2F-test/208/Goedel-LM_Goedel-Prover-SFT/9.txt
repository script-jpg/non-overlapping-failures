  To find the units digit of \(29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81\), we need to determine the units digits of the individual products and then combine them. The units digit of a number is the remainder when the number is divided by 10.
  1. Calculate the units digit of \(29 \cdot 79\):
     - The units digit of \(29\) is \(9\).
     - The units digit of \(79\) is \(9\).
     - The units digit of \(9 \cdot 9\) is \(1\) (since \(9 \cdot 9 = 81\)).
  2. Calculate the units digit of \(31 \cdot 81\):
     - The units digit of \(31\) is \(1\).
     - The units digit of \(81\) is \(1\) (since \(81 = 8 \cdot 10 + 1\)).
     - The units digit of \(1 \cdot 1\) is \(1\).
  3. Combine the units digits:
     - The units digit of \(29 \cdot 79\) is \(1\).
     - The units digit of \(31 \cdot 81\) is \(1\).
     - Adding these units digits: \(1 + 1 = 2\).
  Thus, the units digit of \(29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81\) is \(2\).
