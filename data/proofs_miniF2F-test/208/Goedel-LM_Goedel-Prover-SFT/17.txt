  To find the units digit of \(29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81\), we need to compute the expression modulo 10. We start by calculating the units digits of the individual products and then summing them up.
  1. Calculate the units digit of \(29 \cdot 79\):
     - The units digit of 29 is 9.
     - The units digit of 79 is 9.
     - The units digit of \(9 \cdot 9\) is 1 (since \(9 \cdot 9 = 81\)).
  2. Calculate the units digit of \(31 \cdot 81\):
     - The units digit of 31 is 1.
     - The units digit of 81 is 1 (since \(81 \mod 10 = 1\)).
     - The units digit of \(1 \cdot 1\) is 1.
  3. Sum the units digits:
     - The units digit of \(29 \cdot 79\) is 1.
     - The units digit of \(31 \cdot 81\) is 1.
     - Adding these, the units digit of \(29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81\) is \(1 + 1 = 2\).
  Thus, the units digit of \(29 \cdot 79 + 31 \cdot 81\) is 2.
