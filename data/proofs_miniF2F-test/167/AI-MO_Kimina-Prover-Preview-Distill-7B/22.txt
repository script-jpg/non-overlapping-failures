-- Note 1: The problem has a unique solution due to the constraints, but the value of $x_1$ is transcendental
  -- and cannot be expressed in closed form.  The solution is approximately $x_1 \approx 0.6994632242853230184808846875033$.
  -- The conditions in the problem are equivalent to the following inequality:
  -- $1/2 < x_1 < 1$,
  -- $1/2 < x_2 = x_1 (x_1 + 1) < 1$,
  -- $1/2 < x_3 = x_2 (x_2 + 1/2) < 1$,
  -- $1/2 < x_4 = x_3 (x_3 + 1/3) < 1$,
  -- $1/2 < x_5 = x_4 (x_4 + 1/4) < 1$,
  --...
  -- The recursive inequality $1/2 < x_n < 1 \implies 1/2 < x_{n+1} = x_n (x_n + 1/(n-1)) < 1$ can be verified directly.
  -- The key insight is that the sequence is defined in such a way that it is "mildly" increasing - it never decreases
  -- and increases towards a value of $1$ - and the first value in the sequence ($x_1$) must be between $0$ and $1$,
  -- but so close to $1$ that only one such value exists.
  -- The following Lean proof formalizes the key steps of the original solution, although the formalization
  -- differs in minor details from the English translation given in the IMO problem.
