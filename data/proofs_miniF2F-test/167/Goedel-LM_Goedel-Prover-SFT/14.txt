  We need to prove that there exists exactly one value of \( x_1 \) such that for the sequence \( x_1, x_2, \ldots \) defined by \( x_{n+1} = x_n \left( x_n + \frac{1}{n} \right) \), the inequalities \( 0 < x_n < x_{n+1} < 1 \) hold for every \( n \).
  Given the sequence \( f \) defined by \( f(1, x) = x \) and \( f(n+1, x) = f(n, x) \left( f(n, x) + \frac{1}{n} \right) \), we need to find \( a \) such that \( 0 < a \) and \( a < 1 \) and for all \( n \), \( 0 < f(n, a) < f(n+1, a) < 1 \).
  We claim that \( a = \frac{1}{2} \) satisfies this condition. By induction, we can show that \( f(n, \frac{1}{2}) \) is always positive and less than 1, ensuring the required inequalities.
