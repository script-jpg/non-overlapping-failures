  We need to prove that there exists exactly one real number \( x_1 \) such that for the sequence \( x_1, x_2, \ldots \) defined by \( x_{n+1} = x_n (x_n + \frac{1}{n}) \), we have \( 0 < x_n < x_{n+1} < 1 \) for all \( n \).
  1. **Base Case**: For \( n = 1 \), we have \( x_1 = x \).
  2. **Recursive Step**: For \( n = 1 \), we have \( x_2 = x_1 (x_1 + \frac{1}{1}) = x (x + 1) \).
  3. **Initial Conditions**: We need \( 0 < x < 1 \).
  Given the recursive definition, we can express \( x_2 \) in terms of \( x_1 \):
  \[ x_2 = x_1 (x_1 + \frac{1}{1}) = x_1 (x_1 + 1) \]
  To ensure \( 0 < x_1 < 1 \), we need to check the conditions:
  \[ 0 < x_1 (x_1 + 1) < 1 \]
  This simplifies to:
  \[ 0 < x_1 < 1 \]
  Since \( x_1 \) must be in the interval \( (0, 1) \), the only possible value for \( x_1 \) that satisfies these conditions is \( x_1 = \frac{1}{2} \).
