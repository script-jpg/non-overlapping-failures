  We need to prove that there exists exactly one value of \( x_1 \) such that \( 0 < x_n < x_{n+1} < 1 \) for every \( n \). We will show that the sequence \( x_n \) defined by \( x_1 = 1 \) and \( x_{n+1} = x_n (x_n + \frac{1}{n}) \) for \( n \geq 1 \) is the only sequence satisfying the given conditions.
  1. **Base Case**: For \( n = 1 \), \( x_1 = 1 \).
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume \( x_n = x \). Then, \( x_{n+1} = x (x + \frac{1}{n}) \).
  3. **Conditions**: We need \( 0 < x_n < x_{n+1} < 1 \).
  4. **Verification**: For \( x_n = 1 \), \( x_{n+1} = 1 \cdot (1 + \frac{1}{n}) = 1 + \frac{1}{n} \). Since \( \frac{1}{n} > 0 \), \( 1 + \frac{1}{n} > 1 \). However, \( 1 \) and \( 1 + \frac{1}{n} \) are not in the interval \( (0, 1) \). Therefore, we need to find the correct \( x_1 \) such that \( 0 < x_n < x_{n+1} < 1 \) for all \( n \).
