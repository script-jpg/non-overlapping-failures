  We need to prove that for the sequence \( x_1, x_2, \ldots \) defined by \( x_{n+1} = x_n \left( x_n + \frac{1}{n} \right) \), there exists exactly one value of \( x_1 \) such that \( 0 < x_n < x_{n+1} < 1 \) for every \( n \).
  1. **Existence**: We start by showing that \( x_1 = 1 \) satisfies the conditions \( 0 < x_n < x_{n+1} < 1 \) for all \( n \).
  2. **Uniqueness**: We then show that any other value of \( x_1 \) does not satisfy the conditions.

  -- We claim that the unique value is x₁ = 1.
  use 1
  -- We need to show two things: that 1 satisfies the conditions, and that it is the only one that does.
  constructor
  -- First, we show that 1 satisfies the conditions.
  intro n hn
  -- We use the given properties to show that f n 1 > 0 and f (n + 1) 1 > f n 1.
  simpa [h₀, h₁, hn] using h₁ 1 0
  -- Now, we show that 1 is the only value that satisfies the conditions.
  intro a h
  -- We use the properties of the sequence to show that a must be 1.
  have h₁' := h 0
  simpa [h₀, h₁] at h₁'
