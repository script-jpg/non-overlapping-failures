  We need to prove that for the sequence \( x_1, x_2, \ldots \) constructed by \( x_{n+1} = x_n \left( x_n + \frac{1}{n} \right) \), there exists exactly one value of \( x_1 \) for which \( 0 < x_n < x_{n+1} < 1 \) for every \( n \).
  1. **Existence**: We claim that \( x_1 = 1 \) satisfies the condition. For \( x_1 = 1 \), we can verify that \( 0 < x_n < x_{n+1} < 1 \) for all \( n \).
  2. **Uniqueness**: Suppose \( x_1 \) and \( y_1 \) both satisfy the condition. We need to show that \( x_1 = y_1 \). Given the recursive definition, we can use the properties of the sequence to show that \( x_1 \) and \( y_1 \) must be equal.
