  For every real number \( x_1 \), construct the sequence \( x_1, x_2, \ldots \) by setting \( x_{n+1} = x_n \left( x_n + \frac{1}{n} \right) \) for each \( n \geq 1 \). Prove that there exists exactly one value of \( x_1 \) for which \( 0 < x_n < x_{n+1} < 1 \) for every \( n \).

  -- We need to show that 1 / 2 satisfies the conditions and is unique.

    -- For n = 1, we have f(1, 1/2) = 1/2.
