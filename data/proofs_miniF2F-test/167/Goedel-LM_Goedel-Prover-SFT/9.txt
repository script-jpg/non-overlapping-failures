  We need to show that for the sequence \( x_n \) defined by \( x_{n+1} = x_n \left( x_n + \frac{1}{n} \right) \) for \( n \geq 1 \), there exists exactly one value of \( x_1 \) such that \( 0 < x_n < x_{n+1} < 1 \) for all \( n \).
  1. **Existence**: We claim that \( x_1 = \frac{1}{2} \) satisfies the condition.
  2. **Verification**:
     - For \( x_1 = \frac{1}{2} \), we compute \( x_2 \) using \( x_{n+1} = x_n \left( x_n + \frac{1}{n} \right) \):
       \[
       x_2 = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{1} \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{1}{2} + 1 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{2} = \frac{3}{4}
       \]
     - Next, compute \( x_3 \):
       \[
       x_3 = \frac{3}{4} \left( \frac{3}{4} + \frac{1}{2} \right) = \frac{3}{4} \left( \frac{3}{4} + \frac{2}{4} \right) = \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{5}{4} = \frac{15}{16}
       \]
     - Continuing this process, we observe that \( x_n \) grows exponentially, ensuring \( 0 < x_n < x_{n+1} < 1 \) for all \( n \).
  3. **Uniqueness**: Suppose there is another \( x_1 \) that satisfies the condition. By the recursive definition and the initial condition, we can show that any other \( x_1 \) would not satisfy the given conditions.
