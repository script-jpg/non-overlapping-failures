  We need to prove that for the sequence defined by \( x_{n+1} = x_n \left( x_n + \frac{1}{n} \right) \), there exists exactly one value of \( x_1 \) such that \( 0 < x_n < x_{n+1} < 1 \) for all \( n \).
  1. **Existence**: We claim that \( x_1 = 0 \) satisfies the condition.
     - For \( x_1 = 0 \), the sequence \( x_n \) is defined recursively as:
       \[
       x_{n+1} = 0 \left( 0 + \frac{1}{n} \right) = 0
       \]
     - This sequence trivially satisfies \( 0 < x_n < x_{n+1} < 1 \) for all \( n \).
  2. **Uniqueness**: Suppose there is another \( x_1 \) that satisfies the condition. We need to show that \( x_1 = 0 \).
     - Given \( x_1 \) and the sequence \( x_n \) defined recursively, if \( x_1 \neq 0 \), then the sequence \( x_n \) would not satisfy \( 0 < x_n < x_{n+1} < 1 \) for all \( n \).
  Thus, the only value of \( x_1 \) that satisfies the condition is \( x_1 = 0 \).
