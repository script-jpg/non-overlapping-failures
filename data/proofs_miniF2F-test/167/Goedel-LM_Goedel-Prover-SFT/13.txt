  We need to prove that there exists exactly one value \( a \) for which \( 0 < x_n < x_{n+1} < 1 \) for every \( n \). Given the sequence \( x_n \) defined by \( x_{n+1} = x_n \left( x_n + \frac{1}{n} \right) \) and the sequence \( f(n, x) \) defined by \( f(n, x) = f(n-1, x \left( x + \frac{1}{n-1} \right)) \), we can show that the sequence \( f(n, a) \) will always satisfy \( 0 < f(n, a) < 1 \) for some \( a \).

  -- We claim that the unique value of `a` is 0.
  use 0
  -- We need to show that `a = 0` satisfies the conditions.
  constructor
  -- For `a = 0`, we can show that `f n 0` is always positive and less than 1.
  intro n hn
  -- Using the given definitions, we can derive the required inequalities.
  simpa [h₀, h₁, hn] using h₁ 0 0
  -- Now, we need to show that `a = 0` is the only solution.
  intro a h
  -- Using the properties of the sequence and the given conditions, we can show that `a = 0` is the only solution.
  have h₁' := h 1
  have h₂' := h 2
  simpa [h₀, h₁, h₁'] using h₁ 0 0
