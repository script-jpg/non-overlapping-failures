  We need to prove that there exists exactly one value of \( x_1 \) for which \( 0 < x_n < x_{n+1} < 1 \) for every \( n \). Given the sequence \( x_n \) defined by \( x_{n+1} = x_n \left( x_n + \frac{1}{n} \right) \), we will show that the sequence \( f(n, x) \) is defined by \( f(1, x) = x \) and \( f(n+1, x) = f(n, x) \left( f(n, x) + \frac{1}{n} \right) \). We will prove that the sequence \( f(n, x) \) will always satisfy \( 0 < f(n, x) < 1 \) for \( x \) in the interval \( (0, 1) \).
