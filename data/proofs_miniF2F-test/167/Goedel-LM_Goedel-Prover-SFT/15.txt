  We need to prove that there exists exactly one value of \( x_1 \) for which \( 0 < x_n < x_{n+1} < 1 \) for every \( n \). We will show that the sequence \( x_n \) defined by \( x_{n+1} = x_n (x_n + \frac{1}{n}) \) for \( n \geq 1 \) has a unique value \( x_1 \) that satisfies the given conditions.
  1. **Existence**: We claim that \( x_1 = \frac{1}{2} \) satisfies the conditions \( 0 < x_n < x_{n+1} < 1 \) for all \( n \).
  2. **Uniqueness**: Suppose \( x_1 \) and \( y_1 \) both satisfy the conditions. We need to show that \( x_1 = y_1 \).
