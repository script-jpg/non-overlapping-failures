  We need to prove that for a sequence \( x_1, x_2, \ldots \) defined by \( x_{n+1} = x_n \left( x_n + \frac{1}{n} \right) \) for each \( n \geq 1 \), there exists exactly one value of \( x_1 \) such that \( 0 < x_n < x_{n+1} < 1 \) for every \( n \).
  1. **Existence**: We claim that \( x_1 = \frac{1}{2} \) satisfies the conditions.
  2. **Uniqueness**: We need to show that no other value of \( x_1 \) can satisfy the conditions.

  -- We claim that the unique solution is x_1 = 1/2.
  use 1 / 2
  -- We need to show two things: that 1/2 satisfies the conditions and that it is the only one that does.
  constructor
  -- First, we show that 1/2 satisfies the conditions.
  intro n hn
  -- Using the definition of f, we compute f(n, 1/2) and show that it satisfies the conditions.
  simp_all [h₀, h₁, Nat.cast_pos]
  norm_num
  -- Now, we show that 1/2 is the only solution.
  intro y hy
  -- We use the properties of f to show that y must be 1/2.
  have h₂ := hy 1
  have h₃ := hy 2
