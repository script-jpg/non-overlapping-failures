  We need to show that for every real number \( x_1 \), the sequence \( x_1, x_2, \ldots \) defined by setting \( x_{n+1} = x_n \left( x_n + \frac{1}{n} \right) \) for each \( n \geq 1 \) exists exactly one value of \( x_1 \) such that \( 0 < x_n < x_{n+1} < 1 \) for every \( n \).
  Given the sequence \( x_n \) defined recursively by \( x_{n+1} = x_n \left( x_n + \frac{1}{n} \right) \), we start by analyzing the initial condition \( x_1 \). We need to find the value of \( x_1 \) that ensures the sequence lies within the interval \( (0, 1) \) for all \( n \).

  -- First, we show that \( x_1 = 0 \) satisfies the conditions.
  intro n hn
  simp [h₀, h₁, hn]
  -- Next, we show that \( x_1 = 0 \) is the only solution.
  intro a ha
  have h₂ := ha 1 (by norm_num)
  have h₃ := ha 2 (by norm_num)
  simp [h₀, h₁] at h₂ h₃
  -- By simplifying the expressions, we show that \( a \) must be 0.
