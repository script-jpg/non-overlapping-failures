  We need to prove that there exists exactly one value of \( x_1 \) for which \( 0 < x_n < x_{n+1} < 1 \) for every \( n \). We will show that the sequence \( x_n \) defined by \( x_{n+1} = x_n \left( x_n + \frac{1}{n} \right) \) for \( x_1 \) such that \( 0 < x_1 < 1 \) is the only solution.
  1. **Existence**: We claim that \( x_1 = \frac{1}{2} \) is a solution. We will verify this by induction.
  2. **Uniqueness**: We will show that no other \( x_1 \) satisfies the given conditions.

  refine' ⟨1 / 2, fun n hn => _, fun x hx => _⟩
  -- First, we verify that x_1 = 1/2 satisfies the conditions.
  -- We use induction on n to show that x_{n+1} > x_n and x_n < 1.
  simp [h₀, h₁, hn]
  norm_num
  -- Now, we show that no other x_1 satisfies the conditions.
  have h₁' := hx 1 (by norm_num)
  have h₂' := hx 2 (by norm_num)
  simp [h₀, h₁] at h₁' h₂'
  norm_num at h₁' h₂'
  -- By arithmetic, we conclude that x_1 must be 1/2.
