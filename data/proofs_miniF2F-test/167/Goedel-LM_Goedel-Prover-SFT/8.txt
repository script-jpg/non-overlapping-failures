  We need to prove that there exists a unique real number \( a \) such that for the sequence \( x_n \) defined by \( x_{n+1} = x_n (x_n + \frac{1}{n}) \), the sequence satisfies \( 0 < x_n < x_{n+1} < 1 \) for all \( n \).
  1. **Existence**: We claim that \( a = 0 \) satisfies the conditions.
     - For any \( n \), \( f(n, 0) = 0 \), which is trivially positive.
     - For any \( n \), \( f(n+1, 0) = 0 \), which is positive and less than 1.
  2. **Uniqueness**: Suppose there is another \( a \) that satisfies the conditions. We need to show that \( a = 0 \).
     - Consider the values of \( f(n, a) \) for \( n = 1 \) and \( n = 2 \).
     - By the recursive definition, \( f(2, a) = f(1, a) \cdot (f(1, a) + \frac{1}{1}) \).
     - Since \( f(1, a) = a \), we have \( f(2, a) = a \cdot (a + 1) \).
     - Given \( 0 < f(2, a) < 1 \), we get \( 0 < a \cdot (a + 1) < 1 \).
     - The only solution to this inequality is \( a = 0 \).
