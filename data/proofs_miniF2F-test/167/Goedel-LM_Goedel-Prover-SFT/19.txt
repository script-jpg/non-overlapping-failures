  We need to prove that there exists exactly one value of \( x_1 \) for which \( 0 < x_n < x_{n+1} < 1 \) for every \( n \geq 1 \). The sequence \( x_n \) is defined by \( x_{n+1} = x_n \left( x_n + \frac{1}{n} \right) \).
  1. **Existence**: We show that \( x_1 = 0 \) satisfies the conditions \( 0 < x_n < x_{n+1} < 1 \) for all \( n \).
  2. **Uniqueness**: We show that no other value of \( x_1 \) can satisfy the given conditions.
