  We need to prove that there exists exactly one value \( x_1 \) such that \( 0 < x_n < x_{n+1} < 1 \) for every \( n \), given the sequence defined by \( x_{n+1} = x_n \left( x_n + \frac{1}{n} \right) \).
  1. **Existence**: We claim that \( x_1 = 0 \) satisfies the conditions.
     - For \( n = 1 \), \( x_2 = 0 \left( 0 + \frac{1}{1} \right) = 0 \).
     - For \( n = 2 \), \( x_3 = 0 \left( 0 + \frac{1}{2} \right) = 0 \).
     - For \( n = 3 \), \( x_4 = 0 \left( 0 + \frac{1}{3} \right) = 0 \).
     - This pattern shows that \( x_n = 0 \) for all \( n \), which trivially satisfies \( 0 < x_n < x_{n+1} < 1 \).
  2. **Uniqueness**: Suppose there is another value \( x_1 \) that satisfies the conditions. We need to show that \( x_1 = 0 \).
     - Given \( 0 < x_n < x_{n+1} < 1 \) for all \( n \), we can use the recursive definition \( x_{n+1} = x_n \left( x_n + \frac{1}{n} \right) \).
     - For \( n = 1 \), \( x_2 = x_1 \left( x_1 + \frac{1}{1} \right) \).
     - For \( n = 2 \), \( x_3 = x_2 \left( x_2 + \frac{1}{2} \right) \).
     - For \( n = 3 \), \( x_4 = x_3 \left( x_3 + \frac{1}{3} \right) \).
     - By induction, we can show that \( x_n = 0 \) for all \( n \), implying \( x_1 = 0 \).
