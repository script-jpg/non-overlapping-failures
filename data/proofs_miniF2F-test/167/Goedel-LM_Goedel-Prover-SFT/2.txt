/-We construct the sequence \( x_1, x_2, \ldots \) for every real number \( x_1 \) by setting \( x_{n+1} = x_n \left( x_n + \frac{1}{n} \right) \) for each \( n \geq 1 \). We need to prove that there exists exactly one value of \( x_1 \) for which \( 0 < x_n < x_{n+1} < 1 \) for every \( n \).
  To prove this, we will use the given properties \( h_0 \) and \( h_1 \) to analyze the sequence and its behavior.
  1. **Existence**: We need to show that there exists a unique value \( a \) such that for all \( n \), \( 0 < n \rightarrow 0 < f(n, a) < f(n+1, a) < 1 \).
  2. **Uniqueness**: We need to show that if \( a \) satisfies the above conditions, then \( a \) is unique.
  Given the recursive definition \( x_{n+1} = x_n \left( x_n + \frac{1}{n} \right) \), we can use the properties \( h_0 \) and \( h_1 \) to derive the necessary conditions for the sequence to remain in the interval \( (0, 1) \) for all \( n \).
