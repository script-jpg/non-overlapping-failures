  We need to prove that there exists exactly one value \( x_1 \) such that \( 0 < x_n < x_{n+1} < 1 \) for every \( n \). We define the sequence \( x_n \) by \( x_{n+1} = x_n \left( x_n + \frac{1}{n} \right) \).
  First, we show that \( x_1 = 1 \) satisfies the given conditions. We then show that this value is unique by demonstrating that any other value \( x_1 \) would not satisfy the conditions.
