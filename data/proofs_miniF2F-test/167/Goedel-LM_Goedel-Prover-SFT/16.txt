  We need to prove that there exists exactly one value of \( x_1 \) such that \( 0 < x_n < x_{n+1} < 1 \) for every \( n \). Given the recursive sequence defined by \( x_{n+1} = x_n \left( x_n + \frac{1}{n} \right) \), we can show that the sequence converges to a unique point \( a \) where \( 0 < a < 1 \). This point is \( a = \frac{1}{2} \), and we can verify that this value satisfies the given conditions.
