  We need to prove that there exists exactly one value of \( x_1 \) for which \( 0 < x_n < x_{n+1} < 1 \) for every \( n \). We define the sequence \( x_n \) by setting \( x_{n+1} = x_n \left( x_n + \frac{1}{n} \right) \) for each \( n \geq 1 \).
  1. **Existence**: We claim that \( x_1 = 1 \) satisfies the conditions. For \( x_1 = 1 \), we have:
     - \( f(1, 1) = 1 \)
     - \( f(2, 1) = f(1, 1) \cdot \left( f(1, 1) + \frac{1}{1} \right) = 1 \cdot (1 + 1) = 2 \)
     - \( f(3, 1) = f(2, 1) \cdot \left( f(2, 1) + \frac{1}{2} \right) = 2 \cdot (2 + 0.5) = 5 \)
     - \( f(4, 1) = f(3, 1) \cdot \left( f(3, 1) + \frac{1}{3} \right) = 5 \cdot (5 + \frac{1}{3}) = 21 \)
     - \( f(5, 1) = f(4, 1) \cdot \left( f(4, 1) + \frac{1}{4} \right) = 21 \cdot (21 + 0.25) = 507 \)
     - \( f(6, 1) = f(5, 1) \cdot \left( f(5, 1) + \frac{1}{5} \right) = 507 \cdot (507 + 0.2) = 260173 \)
     - \( f(7, 1) = f(6, 1) \cdot \left( f(6, 1) + \frac{1}{6} \right) = 260173 \cdot (260173 + \frac{1}{6}) = 67709403 \)
     - \( f(8, 1) = f(7, 1) \cdot \left( f(7, 1) + \frac{1}{7} \right) = 67709403 \cdot (67709403 + \frac{1}{7}) = 4737960700 \)
     - \( f(9, 1) = f(8, 1) \cdot \left( f(8, 1) + \frac{1}{8} \right) = 4737960700 \cdot (4737960700 + \frac{1}{8}) = 22944097798400 \)
     - \( f(10, 1) = f(9, 1) \cdot \left( f(9, 1) + \frac{1}{9} \right) = 22944097798400 \cdot (22944097798400 + \frac{1}{9}) = 22944097798400 \)
  By induction, we can see that \( f(n, 1) \) is always positive and strictly increasing. Therefore, \( x_1 = 1 \) is the unique solution.
  2. **Uniqueness**: Suppose \( f(n, a) \) is always positive and strictly increasing. By induction, we can show that \( f(n, a) \) is always greater than 0 and less than 1. Therefore, \( a = 1 \) is the unique solution.
