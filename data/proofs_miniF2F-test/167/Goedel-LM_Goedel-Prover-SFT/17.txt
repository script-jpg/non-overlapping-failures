  For every real number \( x_1 \), construct the sequence \( x_1, x_2, \ldots \) by setting \( x_{n+1} = x_n \left( x_n + \frac{1}{n} \right) \) for each \( n \geq 1 \). We need to prove that there exists exactly one value of \( x_1 \) for which \( 0 < x_n < x_{n+1} < 1 \) for every \( n \).
  1. **Existence**: We claim that \( x_1 = 0 \) satisfies the given conditions. For \( n = 1 \), we have \( x_2 = 0 \left( 0 + \frac{1}{1} \right) = 0 \). For \( n = 2 \), we have \( x_3 = 0 \left( 0 + \frac{1}{2} \right) = 0 \). This pattern continues, with \( x_n = 0 \) for all \( n \).
  2. **Uniqueness**: Suppose \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) both satisfy the conditions. By induction, we can show that \( x_n = 0 \) for all \( n \).
