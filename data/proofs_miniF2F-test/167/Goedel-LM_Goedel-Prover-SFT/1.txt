/-For every real number \( x_1 \), consider the sequence \( x_1, x_2, \ldots \) defined by \( x_{n+1} = x_n \left( x_n + \frac{1}{n} \right) \) for each \( n \geq 1 \). We need to prove that there exists exactly one value of \( x_1 \) for which \( 0 < x_n < x_{n+1} < 1 \) for every \( n \).
  To prove this, we will show that there is a unique value \( a \) such that for all \( n \), \( 0 < f(n, a) < f(n+1, a) < 1 \). We start by using the given properties of the function \( f \):
  1. \( f(1, a) = a \)
  2. \( f(n+1, a) = f(n, a) \left( f(n, a) + \frac{1}{n} \right) \)
  We will use these properties to construct the sequence and show that it satisfies the required conditions.
