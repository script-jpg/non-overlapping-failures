  For every real number \( x_1 \), construct the sequence \( x_1, x_2, \ldots \) by setting \( x_{n+1} = x_n \left( x_n + \frac{1}{n} \right) \) for each \( n \geq 1 \). We need to prove that there exists exactly one value of \( x_1 \) for which \( 0 < x_n < x_{n+1} < 1 \) for every \( n \).

  -- We claim that the unique value is \( x_1 = 0 \).

  -- For \( x_n = 0 \), we have \( 0 < 0 \) is false, so we need to adjust our construction.
  -- Let's consider the sequence \( x_n = \frac{1}{n} \).
  -- We will show that \( x_n = \frac{1}{n} \) satisfies the conditions.
