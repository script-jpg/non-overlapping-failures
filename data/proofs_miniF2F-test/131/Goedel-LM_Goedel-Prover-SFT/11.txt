  Given the function \( f \) defined on the set of positive rational numbers such that \( f(a \cdot b) = f(a) + f(b) \) for all positive rational numbers \( a \) and \( b \), and the property \( f(p) = p \) for every prime number \( p \), we need to determine which of the given numbers \( x \) is such that \( f(x) < 0 \).
  First, we use the property of \( f \) for prime numbers to find \( f(2) \) and \( f(11) \):
  \[ f(2) = 2 \]
  \[ f(11) = 11 \]
  Next, we use the multiplicative property of \( f \) to express \( f(25/11) \) in terms of \( f(2) \) and \( f(11) \):
  \[ f(25/11) = f(25) - f(11) \]
  Since \( 25 = 5^2 \) and \( 11 \) is a prime number, we can further break down \( f(25) \) and \( f(11) \):
  \[ f(25) = f(5^2) = 2f(5) \]
  \[ f(11) = 11 \]
  Given that \( f(p) = p \) for all prime numbers \( p \), we have:
  \[ f(5) = 5 \]
  Thus:
  \[ f(25) = 2 \cdot 5 = 10 \]
  \[ f(25/11) = 10 - 11 = -1 \]
  Since \( -1 < 0 \), we conclude that:
  \[ f(25/11) < 0 \]
