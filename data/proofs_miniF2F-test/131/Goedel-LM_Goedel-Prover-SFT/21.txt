  Given the function \( f \) defined on the set of positive rational numbers such that \( f(a \cdot b) = f(a) + f(b) \) for all positive rational numbers \( a \) and \( b \), and given that \( f(p) = p \) for every prime number \( p \), we need to determine which of the numbers \( \frac{17}{32} \), \( \frac{11}{16} \), \( \frac{7}{9} \), \( \frac{7}{6} \), or \( \frac{25}{11} \) satisfies \( f(x) < 0 \).
  First, we use the property \( f(a \cdot b) = f(a) + f(b) \) to break down the number \( \frac{25}{11} \) into its prime factors. We know that \( \frac{25}{11} = \frac{5^2}{11} \), where 11 is a prime number. Using the given property, we can express \( f\left(\frac{25}{11}\right) \) as:
  \[ f\left(\frac{25}{11}\right) = f\left(\frac{5^2}{11}\right) = f(5^2) - f(11) \]
  Next, we use the fact that \( f(p) = p \) for every prime number \( p \), so:
  \[ f(5^2) = 5^2 = 25 \]
  \[ f(11) = 11 \]
  Thus:
  \[ f\left(\frac{25}{11}\right) = 25 - 11 = 14 \]
  Since \( 14 \geq 0 \), it follows that \( f\left(\frac{25}{11}\right) \geq 0 \). Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{25}{11}\right) \) cannot be less than 0.
