  Given the function \( f \) defined on the set of positive rational numbers such that \( f(a \cdot b) = f(a) + f(b) \) for all positive rational numbers \( a \) and \( b \), and the property \( f(p) = p \) for every prime number \( p \), we need to determine which of the given numbers \( x \) results in \( f(x) < 0 \).
  First, we use the property of \( f \) to express \( f(25/11) \) in terms of simpler fractions. We know that \( 25/11 \) can be decomposed into a product of primes:
  \[
  \frac{25}{11} = \frac{5^2}{11}
  \]
  Using the property \( f(a \cdot b) = f(a) + f(b) \), we have:
  \[
  f\left(\frac{25}{11}\right) = f\left(\frac{5^2}{11}\right) = f\left(\frac{5}{11}\right) + f\left(\frac{5}{11}\right) = 2f\left(\frac{5}{11}\right)
  \]
  Since \( f(p) = p \) for every prime \( p \), we know that \( f\left(\frac{5}{11}\right) = \frac{5}{11} \). Therefore:
  \[
  f\left(\frac{25}{11}\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{5}{11} = \frac{10}{11}
  \]
  However, we need to check if \( f(25/11) < 0 \). Given that \( \frac{10}{11} \) is a positive number, it follows that \( f(25/11) \geq 0 \). Therefore, the statement \( f(25/11) < 0 \) is false, and the correct answer is \( \text{E} \).

  -- Use the property of f to express f(25/11) in terms of simpler fractions.
  have h₂ := h₀ (5 / 11) (by norm_num) (5 / 11) (by norm_num)
  -- Simplify the expression using the property f(a * b) = f(a) + f(b).
  norm_num at h₂
  -- Since f(p) = p for every prime p, we know that f(5/11) = 5/11.
  have h₃ := h₁ 5 (by decide)
  -- Therefore, f(25/11) = 2 * (5/11) = 10/11, which is not less than 0.
  have h₄ := h₁ 11 (by decide)
  norm_num at h₃ h₄
  -- The correct answer is E, as f(25/11) is not less than 0.
