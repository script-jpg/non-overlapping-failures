  Given the function \( f \) defined on the set of positive rational numbers such that \( f(a \cdot b) = f(a) + f(b) \) for all positive rational numbers \( a \) and \( b \), and the property \( f(p) = p \) for every prime number \( p \), we need to determine for which of the following numbers \( x \) \( f(x) < 0 \):
  - \(\frac{17}{32}\)
  - \(\frac{11}{16}\)
  - \(\frac{7}{9}\)
  - \(\frac{7}{6}\)
  - \(\frac{25}{11}\)
  We will show that \( f\left(\frac{25}{11}\right) < 0 \).
  First, we use the property \( f(p) = p \) for every prime number \( p \). Specifically, \( f(2) = 2 \), \( f(3) = 3 \), \( f(5) = 5 \), \( f(7) = 7 \), and so on.
  Next, we express \(\frac{25}{11}\) as a product of primes:
  \[
  \frac{25}{11} = 5^2 \cdot 11
  \]
  Using the property \( f(a \cdot b) = f(a) + f(b) \), we have:
  \[
  f\left(5^2 \cdot 11\right) = f(5^2) + f(11)
  \]
  Since \( 5^2 = 25 \) and \( 11 \) is a prime number, we can write:
  \[
  f\left(25 \cdot 11\right) = f(25) + f(11)
  \]
  Given \( f(25) = 25 \) and \( f(11) = 11 \), we get:
  \[
  f\left(25 \cdot 11\right) = 25 + 11 = 36
  \]
  Thus, \( f\left(\frac{25}{11}\right) = 36 \), which is not less than 0. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate our approach.
