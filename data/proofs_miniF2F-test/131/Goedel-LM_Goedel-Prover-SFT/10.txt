  Given the function \( f \) defined on the set of positive rational numbers such that \( f(a \cdot b) = f(a) + f(b) \) for all positive rational numbers \( a \) and \( b \), and the property \( f(p) = p \) for every prime number \( p \), we need to determine which of the numbers \( x \) satisfies \( f(x) < 0 \).
  First, we use the property \( f(a \cdot b) = f(a) + f(b) \) to express \( f(25 / 11) \) in terms of simpler fractions. We know that \( 25 / 11 \) can be factored into primes and other rational numbers. Using the given properties, we can derive the value of \( f(25 / 11) \) and compare it to 0.

  -- Use the property f(a * b) = f(a) + f(b) to express f(25 / 11)
  have h₂ := h₀ (25 / 11) (by norm_num) 11 (by norm_num)
  -- Simplify the expression using the given properties
  simp only [h₁, Nat.cast_ofNat, Nat.cast_one, mul_one, one_mul, mul_div_cancel_left] at h₂
  -- Normalize the numerical values
  norm_num at h₂
  -- Use linear arithmetic to conclude the proof
