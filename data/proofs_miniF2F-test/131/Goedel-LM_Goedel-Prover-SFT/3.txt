  Given the function \( f \) defined on the set of positive rational numbers such that \( f(a \cdot b) = f(a) + f(b) \) for all positive rational numbers \( a \) and \( b \), and knowing that \( f(p) = p \) for every prime number \( p \), we need to determine for which of the given numbers \( x \) the function \( f \) is negative.
  
  First, we use the property \( f(a \cdot b) = f(a) + f(b) \) to break down the problem. We can express \( \frac{25}{11} \) as a product of simpler fractions:
  \[
  \frac{25}{11} = \frac{5}{11} \cdot 5
  \]
  Using the given property, we have:
  \[
  f\left(\frac{25}{11}\right) = f\left(\frac{5}{11} \cdot 5\right) = f\left(\frac{5}{11}\right) + f(5)
  \]
  Since \( f(5) = 5 \) (by the property \( f(p) = p \) for prime numbers), we get:
  \[
  f\left(\frac{25}{11}\right) = f\left(\frac{5}{11}\right) + 5
  \]
  Next, we need to determine \( f\left(\frac{5}{11}\right) \). Using the property again, we can express \( \frac{5}{11} \) as a product of simpler fractions:
  \[
  \frac{5}{11} = \frac{5}{11} \cdot 1 = \frac{5}{11} \cdot 1
  \]
  Since \( f(1) = 0 \) (by the property \( f(1) = 0 \)), we have:
  \[
  f\left(\frac{5}{11}\right) = f\left(\frac{5}{11} \cdot 1\right) = f\left(\frac{5}{11}\right)
  \]
  Given that \( f(p) = p \) for prime numbers, we know:
  \[
  f\left(\frac{5}{11}\right) = \frac{5}{11}
  \]
  Thus, we have:
  \[
  f\left(\frac{25}{11}\right) = \frac{5}{11} + 5 = \frac{5}{11} + \frac{55}{11} = \frac{60}{11}
  \]
  Since \( \frac{60}{11} > 0 \), we conclude that \( f\left(\frac{25}{11}\right) \geq 0 \). However, the problem states that \( f(x) < 0 \), which implies a contradiction. Therefore, the correct answer is \( \boxed{E} \).
