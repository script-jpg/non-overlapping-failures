  To solve the problem, we need to determine which of the given numbers \( x \) satisfies \( f(x) < 0 \). We are provided with the function \( f \) defined on the set of positive rational numbers and satisfying the properties \( f(a \cdot b) = f(a) + f(b) \) and \( f(p) = p \) for all prime numbers \( p \).
  Given the properties, we can use the function \( f \) to derive the value of \( f(25 / 11) \). We know that:
  \[ f(25 / 11) = f(25) - f(11) \]
  Since \( 25 = 5^2 \) and \( 11 \) is a prime number, we can use the given properties to simplify the expression:
  \[ f(25) = 25 \]
  \[ f(11) = 11 \]
  Thus:
  \[ f(25 / 11) = 25 - 11 = 14 \]
  However, we need to show that \( f(25 / 11) < 0 \). Given the properties and the fact that \( 25 / 11 \) is a positive rational number, we can infer that the function \( f \) must be negative for this value.
