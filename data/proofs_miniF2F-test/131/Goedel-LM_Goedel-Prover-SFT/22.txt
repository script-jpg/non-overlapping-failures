  Given the function \( f \) defined on the set of positive rational numbers such that \( f(a \cdot b) = f(a) + f(b) \) for all positive rational numbers \( a \) and \( b \), and the property \( f(p) = p \) for every prime number \( p \), we need to determine which of the given numbers \( x \) satisfies \( f(x) < 0 \).
  1. We start by noting that \( f \) is a function that satisfies \( f(a \cdot b) = f(a) + f(b) \) and \( f(p) = p \) for all primes \( p \).
  2. We need to check the values of \( f \) at specific points to determine if \( f(x) < 0 \) for any \( x \).
  3. By evaluating \( f \) at specific points and using the properties of \( f \), we can deduce the required inequality.
