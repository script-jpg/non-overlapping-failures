  Given the function \( f \) defined on the set of positive rational numbers such that \( f(a \cdot b) = f(a) + f(b) \) for all positive rational numbers \( a \) and \( b \), and the property \( f(p) = p \) for every prime number \( p \), we need to determine which of the numbers \( \frac{17}{32} \), \( \frac{11}{16} \), \( \frac{7}{9} \), \( \frac{7}{6} \), or \( \frac{25}{11} \) satisfies \( f(x) < 0 \).
  
  We start by expressing \( \frac{25}{11} \) as a product of prime numbers. Using the properties of \( f \), we can break down \( f(25/11) \) into simpler components:
  \[
  f(25/11) = f(5/11 \cdot 5) = f(5/11) + f(5)
  \]
  Next, we use the fact that \( f(p) = p \) for every prime number \( p \). Thus, we have:
  \[
  f(5/11) = f(5) - f(11)
  \]
  Given that \( f(11) = 11 \) and \( f(5) = 5 \), we substitute these values in:
  \[
  f(25/11) = 5 - 11 = -6
  \]
  Since \(-6 < 0\), we conclude that \( f(25/11) < 0 \).
