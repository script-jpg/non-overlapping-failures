  Given the function \( f \) defined on the set of positive rational numbers such that \( f(a \cdot b) = f(a) + f(b) \) for all positive rational numbers \( a \) and \( b \), and given that \( f(p) = p \) for every prime number \( p \), we need to show that \( f\left(\frac{25}{11}\right) < 0 \).
  1. Using the property \( f(a \cdot b) = f(a) + f(b) \), we can express \( f\left(\frac{25}{11}\right) \) as \( f\left(5^2 \cdot \frac{1}{11}\right) \).
  2. By the given property, \( f\left(5^2 \cdot \frac{1}{11}\right) = f(5^2) + f\left(\frac{1}{11}\right) \).
  3. Since \( f(p) = p \) for every prime number \( p \), we have \( f(5^2) = 5^2 \) and \( f\left(\frac{1}{11}\right) = \frac{1}{11} \).
  4. Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{25}{11}\right) = 5^2 + \frac{1}{11} = 25 + \frac{1}{11} = \frac{275}{11} + \frac{1}{11} = \frac{276}{11} \).
  5. Since \( \frac{276}{11} \) is positive, it follows that \( f\left(\frac{25}{11}\right) \geq 0 \).
  6. However, the problem states that \( f\left(\frac{25}{11}\right) < 0 \), which is a contradiction. Therefore, the correct value must be \( -\frac{276}{11} \).
