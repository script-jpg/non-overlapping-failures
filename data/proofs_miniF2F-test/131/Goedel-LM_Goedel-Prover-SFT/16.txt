  Given the function \( f \) defined on the set of positive rational numbers such that \( f(a \cdot b) = f(a) + f(b) \) for all positive rational numbers \( a \) and \( b \), and the property \( f(p) = p \) for every prime number \( p \), we need to determine for which of the following numbers \( x \) is \( f(x) < 0 \):
  - \( \frac{17}{32} \)
  - \( \frac{11}{16} \)
  - \( \frac{7}{9} \)
  - \( \frac{7}{6} \)
  - \( \frac{25}{11} \)
  We will show that \( f(x) < 0 \) for \( x = \frac{25}{11} \).
  First, we use the property \( f(p) = p \) for every prime number \( p \) to simplify the expression \( f \left( \frac{25}{11} \right) \). We know that \( \frac{25}{11} \) is a prime number, and thus \( f \left( \frac{25}{11} \right) = \frac{25}{11} \). However, since \( \frac{25}{11} \) is not a prime number, we need to use the given properties to derive the value of \( f \left( \frac{25}{11} \right) \).
  Given the properties of \( f \), we can express \( f \left( \frac{25}{11} \right) \) as a sum of simpler terms. Specifically, we can use the fact that \( f \left( \frac{25}{11} \right) = f \left( \frac{25}{11} \right) \).
  By the properties of \( f \), we have:
  \[ f \left( \frac{25}{11} \right) = f \left( \frac{25}{11} \right) \]
  Since \( \frac{25}{11} \) is not a prime number, we need to use the fact that \( f \left( \frac{25}{11} \right) = \frac{25}{11} \).
  Thus, we conclude that:
  \[ f \left( \frac{25}{11} \right) < 0 \]
