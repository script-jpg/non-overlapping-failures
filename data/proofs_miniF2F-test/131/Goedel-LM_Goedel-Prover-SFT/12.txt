  Given the function \( f \) defined on the set of positive rational numbers such that \( f(a \cdot b) = f(a) + f(b) \) for all positive rational numbers \( a \) and \( b \), and the property \( f(p) = p \) for every prime number \( p \), we need to determine for which of the following numbers \( x \) is \( f(x) < 0 \):
  - \( \frac{17}{32} \)
  - \( \frac{11}{16} \)
  - \( \frac{7}{9} \)
  - \( \frac{7}{6} \)
  - \( \frac{25}{11} \)
  We will show that \( f \left( \frac{25}{11} \right) < 0 \).
  First, we use the property of \( f \) for prime numbers:
  \[ f \left( \frac{25}{11} \right) = \frac{25}{11} \]
  Since \( \frac{25}{11} \) is a prime number, we have:
  \[ f \left( \frac{25}{11} \right) = \frac{25}{11} \]
  Given that \( \frac{25}{11} \) is a positive number less than 1, we can conclude that:
  \[ \frac{25}{11} < 0 \]
  Thus, the answer is \( \boxed{E} \).

  have h₂ : f (25 /. 11) < 0 := by
    -- Use the property of f for prime numbers
    have h₃ : f (25 /. 11) = 25 /. 11 := by
      apply h₁
      norm_num
    -- Since 25/11 is a prime number, we have f(25/11) = 25/11
    rw [h₃]
    -- Given that 25/11 is a positive number less than 1, we conclude that f(25/11) < 0
