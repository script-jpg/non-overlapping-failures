  To solve the problem, we need to use the properties of the function \( f \) and the given properties to derive the value of \( f \) at a specific point. Specifically, we are given that \( f \) satisfies the property \( f(a \cdot b) = f(a) + f(b) \) for all positive rational numbers \( a \) and \( b \). Additionally, \( f \) is given to be \( p \) for every prime number \( p \). We need to find the value of \( f \) at \( \frac{25}{11} \) and show that it is less than 0.

  -- Use the property of f to express f(25/11) in terms of simpler fractions
  have h₂ := h₀ (5 / 11) (by norm_num) (5 / 11) (by norm_num)
  have h₃ := h₀ 5 (by norm_num) 11 (by norm_num)
  have h₄ := h₀ (5 / 11) (by norm_num) 5 (by norm_num)
  have h₅ := h₀ (5 / 11) (by norm_num) 11 (by norm_num)
  have h₆ := h₀ 5 (by norm_num) 11 (by norm_num)
  -- Simplify the expressions using the given properties
  norm_num at h₂ h₃ h₄ h₅ h₆
  -- Use the fact that f(p) = p for primes to simplify further
  simp_all [h₁]
  -- Combine the results to conclude that f(25/11) < 0
