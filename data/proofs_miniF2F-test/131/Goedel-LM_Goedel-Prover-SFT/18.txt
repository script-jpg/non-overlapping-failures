  Given the function \( f \) defined on the set of positive rational numbers such that \( f(a \cdot b) = f(a) + f(b) \) for all positive rational numbers \( a \) and \( b \), and the property \( f(p) = p \) for every prime number \( p \), we need to determine which of the numbers \( \frac{17}{32} \), \( \frac{11}{16} \), \( \frac{7}{9} \), \( \frac{7}{6} \), or \( \frac{25}{11} \) is such that \( f(x) < 0 \).
  First, we use the property \( f(a \cdot b) = f(a) + f(b) \) to break down the base-11 fraction:
  \[ f\left(\frac{25}{11}\right) = f\left(25\right) - f\left(11\right) \]
  Next, we use the property \( f(p) = p \) for every prime number \( p \):
  \[ f(25) = 25 \]
  \[ f(11) = 11 \]
  Thus, we have:
  \[ f\left(\frac{25}{11}\right) = 25 - 11 = 14 \]
  Since \( 14 \) is not less than \( 0 \), we need to check the base-11 fraction:
  \[ \frac{25}{11} = 2 + \frac{3}{11} \]
  Using the property \( f(a \cdot b) = f(a) + f(b) \):
  \[ f\left(2 + \frac{3}{11}\right) = f\left(2\right) + f\left(\frac{3}{11}\right) \]
  Since \( f(2) = 2 \) and \( f(3) = 3 \):
  \[ f\left(2 + \frac{3}{11}\right) = 2 + 3 = 5 \]
  Thus, \( f\left(\frac{25}{11}\right) = 5 \), which is not less than \( 0 \). Therefore, the correct answer is \( \frac{25}{11} \).
