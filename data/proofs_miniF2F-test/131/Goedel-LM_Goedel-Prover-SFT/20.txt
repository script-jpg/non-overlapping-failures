  Given the function \( f \) defined on the set of positive rational numbers such that \( f(a \cdot b) = f(a) + f(b) \) for all positive rational numbers \( a \) and \( b \), and given that \( f(p) = p \) for every prime number \( p \), we need to determine the value of \( f \) at \( \frac{25}{11} \) and show that it is less than 0.
  1. Using the property \( f(a \cdot b) = f(a) + f(b) \), we can express \( f\left(\frac{25}{11}\right) \) in terms of simpler fractions.
  2. We know that \( f(p) = p \) for every prime \( p \).
  3. By applying the multiplicative property repeatedly, we can break down \( f\left(\frac{25}{11}\right) \) into a sum of simpler terms.
  4. Using the fact that \( f(p) = p \) for primes, we can compute the exact value of \( f\left(\frac{25}{11}\right) \).
  5. Finally, we verify that the computed value is indeed less than 0.
