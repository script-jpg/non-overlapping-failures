  Given the function \( f \) defined on the set of positive rational numbers such that \( f(a \cdot b) = f(a) + f(b) \) for all positive rational numbers \( a \) and \( b \), and given that \( f(p) = p \) for every prime number \( p \), we need to determine for which of the following numbers \( x \) \( f(x) < 0 \):
  - \(\frac{17}{32}\)
  - \(\frac{11}{16}\)
  - \(\frac{7}{9}\)
  - \(\frac{7}{6}\)
  - \(\frac{25}{11}\)
  We will show that \( f\left(\frac{25}{11}\right) < 0 \).
  First, we use the property \( f(p) = p \) for every prime number \( p \). We express \( \frac{25}{11} \) as a product of prime numbers:
  \[
  \frac{25}{11} = \frac{5^2}{11}
  \]
  Since \( 5 \) is a prime number, we can use the given property to simplify \( f\left(\frac{25}{11}\right) \):
  \[
  f\left(\frac{25}{11}\right) = f\left(5^2 / 11\right) = f\left(5^2\right) - f(11)
  \]
  Next, we use the property \( f(a \cdot b) = f(a) + f(b) \):
  \[
  f\left(5^2\right) = f\left(5 \cdot 5\right) = f(5) + f(5) = 2f(5)
  \]
  Since \( f(11) = 11 \) (by the property \( f(p) = p \) for prime \( p \)), we have:
  \[
  f\left(\frac{25}{11}\right) = 2f(5) - 11
  \]
  To find \( f(5) \), we use the property \( f(a \cdot b) = f(a) + f(b) \):
  \[
  f(5) = f\left(5 \cdot 1\right) = f(5) + f(1)
  \]
  Since \( f(1) = 1 \) (by the property \( f(p) = p \) for prime \( p \)), we have:
  \[
  f(5) = f(5) + 1 \implies f(5) = 1
  \]
  Thus:
  \[
  f\left(\frac{25}{11}\right) = 2 \cdot 1 - 11 = 2 - 11 = -9
  \]
  Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{25}{11}\right) < 0 \).
