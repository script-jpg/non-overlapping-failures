  Given a function \( f \) defined on the set of positive rational numbers such that \( f(a \cdot b) = f(a) + f(b) \) for all positive rational numbers \( a \) and \( b \), and given that \( f \) also satisfies \( f(p) = p \) for every prime number \( p \), we need to determine the value of \( x \) for which \( f(x) < 0 \).
  First, we use the given properties of \( f \) to evaluate \( f \) at specific points. We know that \( f(a \cdot b) = f(a) + f(b) \). Using this property, we can express \( f(25 / 11) \) in terms of simpler fractions.
  Next, we use the fact that \( f(p) = p \) for every prime number \( p \). This allows us to simplify the expression for \( f(25 / 11) \) further.
  Finally, we combine the results to show that \( f(25 / 11) < 0 \).
