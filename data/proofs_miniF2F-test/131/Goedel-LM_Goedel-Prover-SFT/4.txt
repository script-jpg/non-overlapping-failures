  Given the function \( f \) defined on the set of positive rational numbers such that \( f(a \cdot b) = f(a) + f(b) \) for all positive rational numbers \( a \) and \( b \), and given that \( f(p) = p \) for every prime number \( p \), we need to determine for which of the following numbers \( x \) is \( f(x) < 0 \):
  \[
  \textbf{(A) } \frac{17}{32} \qquad \textbf{(B) } \frac{11}{16} \qquad \textbf{(C) } \frac{7}{9} \qquad \textbf{(D) } \frac{7}{6} \qquad \textbf{(E) } \frac{25}{11}
  \]
  We aim to show that the answer is \(\textbf{(E) } \frac{25}{11}\).
