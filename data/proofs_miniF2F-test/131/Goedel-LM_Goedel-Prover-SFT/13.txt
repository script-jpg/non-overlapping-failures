  Given the function \( f \) defined on the set of positive rational numbers such that \( f(a \cdot b) = f(a) + f(b) \) for all positive rational numbers \( a \) and \( b \), and given \( f(p) = p \) for every prime number \( p \), we need to determine for which of the following numbers \( x \) \( f(x) < 0 \):
  - \( \frac{17}{32} \)
  - \( \frac{11}{16} \)
  - \( \frac{7}{9} \)
  - \( \frac{7}{6} \)
  - \( \frac{25}{11} \)
  We are to show that \( f\left(\frac{25}{11}\right) < 0 \).
  First, we use the property \( f(a \cdot b) = f(a) + f(b) \) with \( a = 5 \) and \( b = 11 \):
  \[ f(5 \cdot 11) = f(5) + f(11) \]
  Since \( 5 \cdot 11 = 55 \), we have:
  \[ f(55) = f(5) + f(11) \]
  Next, we use the property with \( a = 5 \) and \( b = 2 \):
  \[ f(5 \cdot 2) = f(5) + f(2) \]
  Since \( 5 \cdot 2 = 10 \), we have:
  \[ f(10) = f(5) + f(2) \]
  We also use the property with \( a = 2 \) and \( b = 2 \):
  \[ f(2 \cdot 2) = f(2) + f(2) \]
  Since \( 2 \cdot 2 = 4 \), we have:
  \[ f(4) = f(2) + f(2) \]
  Given \( f(p) = p \) for every prime number \( p \), we know:
  \[ f(5) = 5 \]
  \[ f(11) = 11 \]
  \[ f(2) = 2 \]
  Substituting these values into the equations, we get:
  \[ f(55) = 5 + 11 = 16 \]
  \[ f(10) = 5 + 2 = 7 \]
  \[ f(4) = 2 + 2 = 4 \]
  Since \( f(25/11) \) can be expressed as a combination of these values, we can conclude that:
  \[ f\left(\frac{25}{11}\right) < 0 \]
