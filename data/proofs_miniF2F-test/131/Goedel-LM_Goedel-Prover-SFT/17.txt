  To show that \( f \left( \frac{25}{11} \right) < 0 \), we start by using the properties of the function \( f \). Given that \( f \) satisfies \( f(a \cdot b) = f(a) + f(b) \) for all positive rational numbers \( a \) and \( b \), and that \( f(p) = p \) for every prime number \( p \), we can derive the value of \( f \left( \frac{25}{11} \right) \).
  1. First, we use the property \( f(a \cdot b) = f(a) + f(b) \) to express \( f \left( \frac{25}{11} \right) \) in terms of simpler fractions.
  2. We know that \( f(p) = p \) for every prime \( p \), so we can use this property to simplify the expression.
  3. By applying the multiplicative property repeatedly, we can break down \( \frac{25}{11} \) into simpler fractions.
  4. Finally, we use the fact that \( f(p) = p \) for every prime \( p \) to conclude that \( f \left( \frac{25}{11} \right) = -\frac{25}{11} \), which is less than 0.
