  Given a function \( f \) defined on the set of positive rational numbers such that \( f(a \cdot b) = f(a) + f(b) \) for all positive rational numbers \( a \) and \( b \), and given that \( f(p) = p \) for every prime number \( p \), we need to determine for which of the following numbers \( x \) is \( f(x) < 0 \):
  - \( \frac{17}{32} \)
  - \( \frac{11}{16} \)
  - \( \frac{7}{9} \)
  - \( \frac{7}{6} \)
  - \( \frac{25}{11} \)
  To show that \( f \) is less than 0 for \( \frac{25}{11} \), we use the properties of the function and the given prime condition. Specifically, we use the property \( f(p) = p \) for prime numbers and the multiplicative property of \( f \).
  1. We start by expressing \( \frac{25}{11} \) in terms of prime numbers.
  2. Using the multiplicative property of \( f \), we can break down \( f \) into simpler components.
  3. We then apply the property \( f(p) = p \) for prime numbers to simplify the expression.
  4. Finally, we use the fact that \( \frac{25}{11} \) is a product of primes and the given properties to conclude that \( f(25/11) < 0 \).
