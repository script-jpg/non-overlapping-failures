  Given the function \( f \) defined on the set of positive rational numbers such that \( f(a \cdot b) = f(a) + f(b) \) for all positive rational numbers \( a \) and \( b \), and given the property \( f(p) = p \) for every prime number \( p \), we need to determine for which of the numbers \( x \) is \( f(x) < 0 \). The numbers are:
  - \( \frac{17}{32} \)
  - \( \frac{11}{16} \)
  - \( \frac{7}{9} \)
  - \( \frac{7}{6} \)
  - \( \frac{25}{11} \)
  We are to show that \( f \) is negative for \( \frac{25}{11} \).

  -- Combine the results to show that f(25/11) is negative.
