  Given the function \( f \) defined on the set of positive rational numbers such that \( f(a \cdot b) = f(a) + f(b) \) for all positive rational numbers \( a \) and \( b \), and the property \( f(p) = p \) for every prime number \( p \), we need to determine for which of the given numbers \( x \) is \( f(x) < 0 \).
  To solve this, we use the properties of \( f \):
  1. \( f(a \cdot b) = f(a) + f(b) \)
  2. \( f(p) = p \) for every prime \( p \)
  We will evaluate \( f \) at specific points and use the properties to derive the value of \( f \) at \( \frac{25}{11} \).
