-- The function $f$ is defined on the set of positive rational numbers and satisfies $f(a\cdot b)=f(a)+f(b)$ for all positive rational numbers $a$ and $b$.
  -- This implies that $f\left(\frac{p}{q}\right) = f(p) - f(q)$ if $\frac{p}{q}$ is a positive rational number, where $p$ and $q$ are primes.
  have h₂ (p q : ℕ) (hp : Nat.Prime p) (hq : Nat.Prime q) : f (p /. q) = f p - f q := by
    rw [show (p : ℚ) / q = p * (1 / q) by simp]
    rw [h₀ p (by positivity) (1/q) (by positivity)]
    rw [h₀ _ (by positivity) _ (by positivity)]
    ring

  -- Suppose that $f$ also has the property that $f(p)=p$ for every prime number $p$.
  -- Using this fact, we can compute $f\left(\frac{p}{q}\right) = f(p) - f(q) = p - q$ if $\frac{p}{q}$ is a positive rational number, where $p$ and $q$ are primes.
  replace h₂ (p q : ℕ) (hp : Nat.Prime p) (hq : Nat.Prime q) : f (p /. q) = p - q := by
    rw [h₂ p q hp hq ]
    rw [h₁ p hp, h₁ q hq]

  -- For which of the following numbers $x$ is $f(x)<0$?
  -- We can compute $f\left(\frac{25}{11}\right) = f\left(\frac{5\cdot 5}{11}\right) = f(5) - f(11) = 5 - 11 = -6$.
  have h₃ : f (25 /. 11) = -6 := by
    rw [h₂ 25 11 (by norm_num) (by norm_num)]
    rw [h₁ 5 (by norm_num), h₁ 11 (by norm_num)]
    norm_num

  -- Therefore $f\left(\frac{25}{11}\right) = -6 < 0$.

  -- The final answer is \textbf{(E) }\frac{25}{11}.
