-- First, let's calculate the value of $f$ for the factors of the given options.

  have h_11 : f 11 = 11 := by
    specialize h₁ 11 Nat.prime11
    exact h₁

  have h_7 : f 7 = 7 := by
    specialize h₁ 7 Nat.prime7
    exact h₁

  have h_2 : f 2 = 2 := by
    specialize h₁ 2 Nat.prime2
    exact h₁

  have h_3 : f 3 = 3 := by
    specialize h₁ 3 Nat.prime3
    exact h₁

  have h_5 : f 5 = 5 := by
    specialize h₁ 5 Nat.prime5
    exact h₁

  -- Now, let's calculate $f(25/11)$:

  have h_25_11 : f (25 /. 11) = -6 := by
    rw [show (25 /. 11 : ℚ) = (5 /. 11) ^ 2 by norm_num]
    have : f (5 /. 11) = f 5 - f 11 := by
      specialize h₀ (5 / 11) (11 / 11) (by norm_num) (by norm_num)
      norm_num at h₀
      exact h₀
    rw [this, h_11, h_5]
    norm_num
  --The answer is indeed (E) $\frac{25}{11}$, as f(x) is negative for exactly this number.

  rw [h_25_11]
  norm_num
