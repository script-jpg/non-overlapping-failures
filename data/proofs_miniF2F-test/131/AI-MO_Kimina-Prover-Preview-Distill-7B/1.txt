-- The function f is defined on the set of positive rational numbers and satisfies f(a·b) = f(a) + f(b).
  -- We also know that f(p) = p for any prime number p.

  -- We need to determine which of the given numbers has f(x) < 0.

  -- Let's start by analyzing f(1). Since 1 is a positive rational number, we can consider f(1·1) = f(1) + f(1).

  -- We can also determine f(1/p) for a prime p. Using f(1) = f(1/p·p) = f(1/p) + f(p) = f(1/p) + p,
