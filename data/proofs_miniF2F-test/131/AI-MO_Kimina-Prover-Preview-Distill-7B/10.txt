-- Let's first analyze the number 25/11. We need to determine if f(25/11) < 0.

  -- Decompose 25/11 into its prime components:
  -- 25 = 5 × 5
  -- 11 = 11 (prime)
  -- So 25/11 = 5² × 11⁻¹

  -- Using the property f(a·b) = f(a) + f(b), we get:
  -- f(25/11) = f(5² × 11⁻¹) = f(5²) + f(11⁻¹)
  --          = 2·f(5) - f(11)
  -- (Note: f(5²) = 2·f(5) because f(a²) = f(a·a) = f(a) + f(a) = 2·f(a))

  -- Given that f(p) = p for any prime p:
  -- f(5) = 5 and f(11) = 11

  -- So f(25/11) = 2×5 - 11 = 10 - 11 = -1 < 0

  have : f (25 /. 11) = f (5 ^ 2) + f (11⁻¹) := by
    rw [show (25 /. 11 : ℚ) = (5 ^ 2) * (11⁻¹) by norm_num]
    exact h₀ (5 ^ 2) (by norm_num) (11⁻¹) (by norm_num)

  -- The key is to show that f(11⁻¹) = -f(11). This would give us:
  -- f(25/11) = 2×f(5) + f(11⁻¹) = 2×5 + (-f(11)) = 10 - 11 = -1 < 0

  have : f (11⁻¹) = - f 11 := by
    have : f 1 = f (11 * (11⁻¹)) := by
      norm_num
    rw [h₀ 11 (by norm_num) (11⁻¹) (by norm_num)] at this
    linarith

  -- We also need that f(5) = 5 and f(11) = 11, which follows from the given properties.

  have : f 5 = 5 := by exact h₁ 5 (by norm_num)
  have : f 11 = 11 := by exact h₁ 11 (by norm_num)

  -- Putting it all together:
  -- f(25/11) = f(5²) + f(11⁻¹) = 2×f(5) + (-f(11)) = 2×5 - 11 = 10 - 11 = -1 < 0

  have : f (5 ^ 2) = 2 * f 5 := by
    rw [pow_two]
    have : f (5 * 5) = f 5 + f 5 := h₀ 5 (by norm_num) 5 (by norm_num)
    linarith
