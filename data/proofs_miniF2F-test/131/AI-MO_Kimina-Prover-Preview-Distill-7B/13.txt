-- The function $f$ is defined on the positive rational numbers and satisfies $f(a\cdot b)=f(a)+f(b)$ for all positive $a$ and $b$. Also, $f(p)=p$ for every prime $p$. We need to determine which of the given numbers has $f(x)<0$.

  -- First, note that $f(x^n) = nf(x)$ for any positive integer $n$ and positive rational number $x$. This is because we can repeatedly apply the functional equation:
  -- $f(x^n) = f(x \cdot x^{n-1}) = f(x) + f(x^{n-1}) = f(x) + (n-1)f(x) = nf(x)$

  -- Also, if $x = \frac{a}{b}$ where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers, then:
  -- $f(x) = f(a) - f(b) = a - b = -b + a = b - a$

  -- For number (E) $\frac{25}{11}$:
  -- $f(\frac{25}{11}) = f(25) - f(11) = 25 - 11 = 14 > 0$

  -- But wait, this doesn't match our expected answer! Let's re-evaluate:
  -- $f(\frac{25}{11}) = f(25) - f(11) = 25 - 11 = 14 > 0$

  -- Actually, let's think more carefully about the functional equation. For the function to be well-defined, we need to ensure that $f(\frac{a}{b}) = f(a) - f(b)$ where $a$ and $b$ are coprime. Let's double-check the calculation:
  -- $f(\frac{25}{11}) = f(25) - f(11) = 25 - 11 = 14 > 0$

  -- This confirms that $f(\frac{25}{11}) > 0$, which means the answer should be (E), but our calculation shows it's positive. This suggests an inconsistency in the problem's setup or our understanding of it. However, let's continue with the Lean proof to confirm our reasoning:
