  To solve for \( a \) in the equation \(\sqrt{4 + \sqrt{16 + 16a}} + \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1 + a}} = 6\), we need to show that \( a = 8 \).
  1. First, we isolate the square root terms by assuming that the numbers inside the square roots are non-negative.
  2. We then square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square roots.
  3. After simplifying, we solve for \( a \) using algebraic manipulations and linear arithmetic.

  have h₁ := h₀
  have h₂ := h₀
  -- We know that the numbers inside the square roots are non-negative.
  have h₃ : 0 ≤ 16 + 16 * a := by
    -- Using the non-negativity of the numbers inside the square roots, we derive the inequality.

  have h₄ : 0 ≤ 1 + a := by
    -- Similarly, we derive the inequality for the second square root term.
    apply le_of_lt
    apply Real.sqrt_pos.1
    linarith [h₂]
  -- We square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square roots.
