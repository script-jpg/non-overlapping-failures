  To solve for \( a \) in the equation \( \sqrt{4 + \sqrt{16 + 16a}} + \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1 + a}} = 6 \), we first establish that the terms inside the square roots are non-negative. This allows us to use the properties of square roots and algebraic manipulations to simplify the equation. We then use the given constraints and the properties of the square root function to derive the value of \( a \).
