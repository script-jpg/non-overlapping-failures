  To solve for \( a \) in the equation \(\sqrt{4 + \sqrt{16 + 16a}} + \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1 + a}} = 6\), we need to show that \( a = 8 \).
  1. First, we establish that the expression inside the square root \(\sqrt{16 + 16a}\) is non-negative. This implies that \( 16 + 16a \geq 0 \), which simplifies to \( a \geq -1 \).
  2. Next, we use the fact that the square root function is non-negative to deduce that \(\sqrt{4 + \sqrt{16 + 16a}} \geq 0\) and \(\sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1 + a}} \geq 0\).
  3. We then use the given equation to derive a relationship involving \( a \). By simplifying and solving the equation, we find that \( a = 8 \).
