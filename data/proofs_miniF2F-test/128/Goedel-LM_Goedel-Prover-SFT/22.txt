  To solve for \( a \) in the equation \(\sqrt{4 + \sqrt{16 + 16a}} + \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1 + a}} = 6\), we start by isolating the square roots. We know that the sum of two square roots equals 6, so we can use this to find \( a \). By squaring both sides and simplifying, we can derive the value of \( a \).
