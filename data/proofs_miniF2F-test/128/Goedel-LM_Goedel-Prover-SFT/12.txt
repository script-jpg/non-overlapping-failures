  To solve the equation \(\sqrt{4 + \sqrt{16 + 16a}} + \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1 + a}} = 6\) for \(a\), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Square both sides**: To eliminate the square roots, we first square both sides of the equation.
  2. **Simplify the expression**: We simplify the resulting expression by isolating the square roots and simplifying the terms.
  3. **Square both sides again**: We then square both sides again to eliminate the remaining square roots.
  4. **Simplify further**: We simplify the expression further to isolate \(a\).
  5. **Solve for \(a\)**: Finally, we solve for \(a\) and find that \(a = 8\).
