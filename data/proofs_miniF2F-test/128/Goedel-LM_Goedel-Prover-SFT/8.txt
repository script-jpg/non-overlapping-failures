Non-negative numbers of the form  $\sqrt{x}+\sqrt{y}$  are always less than a positive number  $z$  if both  $x$  and  $y$  are less than  $z^2$.
  　　Apply this property to the given equation to find an upper bound for  $a$.
  　　Solve the equation, taking into account that the numbers on the left-hand side are non-negative.
  　　When you solve this equation, you should find that  $a$  must be 8.
  　　In this case, the solution where you know that  $a$  is 8 is the only solution, so you don't need to check for other solutions.
  　　The solution  $a = 8$  is valid, and the solution  $a = 6$  is invalid.
  　　Since you are looking for a solution that is always true, what you found is the only solution.
  　　Therefore, the answer is  $a = 8$.
