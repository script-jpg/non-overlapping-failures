To solve the equation \(\sqrt{4 + \sqrt{16 + 16a}} + \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1 + a}} = 6\) for \(a\), we start by isolating the square roots. We assume that the equation holds true and proceed to manipulate the terms algebraically. By simplifying the equation and solving for \(a\), we find that \(a = 8\).

  -- We start by assuming the given equation holds.
  have h₁ : Real.sqrt (4 + Real.sqrt (16 + 16 * a)) + Real.sqrt (1 + Real.sqrt (1 + a)) = 6 := by
    linarith [h₀]
  -- We need to solve for `a`.
  have h₂ : a = 8 := by
    -- We use `nlinarith` to solve the equation by simplifying and solving for `a`.
    nlinarith [Real.sqrt_nonneg (16 + 16 * a), Real.sqrt_nonneg (1 + a), sq_sqrt (show 0 ≤ 16 + 16 * a by nlinarith),
      sq_sqrt (show 0 ≤ 1 + a by nlinarith)]
  -- Finally, we conclude that `a = 8`.
