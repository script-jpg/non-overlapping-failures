1. First, we establish that \( 1 + a \geq 0 \), so \( \sqrt{1 + a} \) is defined.
  have : 0 ≤ 1 + a := by linarith
  -- We know that 16 + 16a is non-negative because a is a real number.
  have : 0 ≤ 16 + 16 * a := by linarith
  -- We also know that 4 + sqrt(16 + 16a) is non-negative.
  have : 0 ≤ 4 + Real.sqrt (16 + 16 * a) := by positivity
  -- We know that 1 + sqrt(1 + a) is non-negative.
  have : 0 ≤ 1 + Real.sqrt (1 + a) := by positivity
  -- Square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square roots.
  nlinarith [sq_sqrt (show 0 ≤ 16 + 16 * a from by linarith),
    sq_sqrt (show 0 ≤ 1 + a from by assumption),
    sq_sqrt (show 0 ≤ 4 + Real.sqrt (16 + 16 * a) from by assumption),
    sq_sqrt (show 0 ≤ 1 + Real.sqrt (1 + a) from by assumption),
    sq_nonneg (Real.sqrt (16 + 16 * a) - 2 * Real.sqrt (1 + Real.sqrt (1 + a)))]
