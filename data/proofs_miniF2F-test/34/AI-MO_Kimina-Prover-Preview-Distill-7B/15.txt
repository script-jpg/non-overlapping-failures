The problem states that a snack-size tin of peaches has 40 calories and is 2% of a person's daily caloric requirement. We need to find the total number of calories in the daily requirement.

First, let's think about how to set up the problem. The key insight is that 2% of the daily requirement equals 40 calories. Let's denote the total daily calories as $x$. Then we have:
- 2% of $x$ = 40 calories
- $0.02 \cdot x = 40$
- Solving for $x$: $x = \frac{40}{0.02} = 2000$

In Lean, we'll need to formalize this as a real number equation. We're given that $x/50 = 40$, which is another way to express the same relationship (since $x/50 = x \cdot 0.02$).

Let's analyze the Lean proof:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

This imports the necessary libraries and opens namespaces for working with real numbers and arithmetic operations.

Now, let's define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_24 (x : ℝ) (h₀ : x / 50 = 40) : x = 2000 := by
```

We have a real number $x$ representing the total daily calories, and we're given that $x/50 = 40$. This is equivalent to $0.02 \cdot x = 40$.

To solve for $x$, we can multiply both sides by 50:
- $x = 40 \cdot 50 = 2000$

Let's complete the Lean proof:

```tactics
field_simp at h₀
linarith
```

The `field_simp` tactic simplifies expressions involving field operations. In this case, it's transforming $x/50 = 40$ into a form that Lean can work with more easily. After simplification, Lean's arithmetic solver (`linarith`) can directly solve for $x$ by multiplying both sides by 50, yielding $x = 2000$.

Therefore, the number of calories that fulfills a person's daily caloric requirement is 2000.
