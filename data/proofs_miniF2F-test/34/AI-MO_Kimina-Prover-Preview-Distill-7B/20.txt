We begin by importing the necessary libraries and setting up the theorem statement. The theorem states that if $x/50 = 40$ (where $x$ represents the total calories in a person's daily requirement), then $x = 2000$.

Now, let's think about the algebraic manipulation needed to solve for $x$. We have the equation $x/50 = 40$, which means that $x = 40 \times 50$. Let's compute this: $40 \times 50 = 2000$. 

In Lean, we can use the `linarith` tactic to solve linear arithmetic goals. The `linarith` tactic is powerful for solving goals involving linear equalities and inequalities over real numbers or integers. In this case, it can directly solve for $x$ given the equation $x/50 = 40$.

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_24 (x : ℝ) (h₀ : x / 50 = 40) : x = 2000 := by
  linarith
```

The `linarith` tactic is applied with the hypothesis `h₀ : x / 50 = 40` and is able to derive that `x = 2000` by multiplying both sides of the equation by 50. This tactic is powerful enough to handle linear equalities directly, so it can solve this goal without further intervention.

To recap the mathematical reasoning: if $x/50 = 40$, then multiplying both sides by 50 gives $x = 40 \times 50 = 2000$. The Lean proof is remarkably concise because the `linarith` tactic can handle this straightforward algebraic manipulation automatically.

Therefore, the Lean 4 proof is complete, showing that if $x/50 = 40$, then $x = 2000$. This confirms that the total calories in a person's daily requirement is 2000, given that a snack-size tin of peaches with 40 calories is 2% of that requirement.
