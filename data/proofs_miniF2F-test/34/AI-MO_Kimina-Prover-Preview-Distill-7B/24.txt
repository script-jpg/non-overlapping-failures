So the approach is to set up the basic structure of the proof, including importing necessary libraries and opening namespaces for common mathematical concepts. Then, the theorem is stated with the given condition that 40 calories is 2% of the daily requirement, expressed as `x / 50 = 40`, where `x` represents the total calories in the daily requirement. Finally, the `linarith` tactic is used to solve the linear arithmetic goal, proving that `x = 2000`.

The key insight is that if 40 calories is 2% of the daily requirement, then the total daily requirement is 40 calories / 2% = 2000 calories. The formal proof captures this calculation precisely by solving the equation `x / 50 = 40` to get `x = 2000`.

Therefore, the answer is 2000 calories.
