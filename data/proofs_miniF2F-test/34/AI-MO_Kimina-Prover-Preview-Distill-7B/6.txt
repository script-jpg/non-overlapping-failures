-- We are given that a snack-size tin of peaches has 40 calories, which is 2% of a person's daily caloric requirement. We need to find the total number of calories in the daily requirement.

  -- Let $x$ be the total number of calories in the daily requirement. Then $2\%$ of $x$ is equal to 40 calories. This can be written as $0.02 \cdot x = 40$.

  -- Solving for $x$, we have $x = \frac{40}{0.02} = 2000$.

The problem essentially gives us that $x/50 = 40$ where $x$ is the total number of calories. This is because 2% is equivalent to dividing by 50 (since 2% = 2/100 = 1/50). So if $x/50 = 40$, then $x = 40 \cdot 50 = 2000$. 

The Lean proof is remarkably concise because Lean's `linarith` tactic is powerful enough to solve linear arithmetic goals directly. It's able to deduce that if $x/50 = 40$, then $x = 2000$ by multiplying both sides by 50. This Lean proof demonstrates how Lean can handle simple algebraic manipulations that would be done by hand in a traditional proof.

Therefore, the answer is 2000 calories.
