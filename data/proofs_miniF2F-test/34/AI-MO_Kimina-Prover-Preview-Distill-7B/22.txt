The problem gives us that a snack-size tin of peaches has 40 calories, which is 2% of a person's daily caloric requirement. We need to find the total number of calories in the daily requirement.

First, let's think about how to set up the equation. If 40 calories is 2% of the daily requirement, we can represent the daily requirement as $x$ calories. Then, 2% of $x$ is $0.02x$. We know $0.02x = 40$.

In Lean, we'll work with the equation $x/50 = 40$ which is equivalent to $0.02x = 40$ because $1/50 = 0.02$.

Let's solve for $x$ algebraically:
$0.02x = 40$
$x = 40 / 0.02$
$x = 40 \times 50$
$x = 2000$

So the total daily caloric requirement is 2000 calories.

In the Lean proof:

We have imported the necessary libraries and opened namespaces. Now we'll define our theorem:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_24 (x : ℝ) (h₀ : x / 50 = 40) : x = 2000 := by
```

We have our theorem statement. We have a real number $x$ where $x/50 = 40$, and we need to prove that $x = 2000$.

To solve $x/50 = 40$, we multiply both sides by 50 to isolate $x$:
$x = 40 \times 50$
$x = 2000$

In Lean, we can use the `linarith` tactic to solve linear arithmetic goals. This tactic can handle the equation $x/50 = 40$ and derive $x = 2000$ directly:

```tactics
linarith
```

The `linarith` tactic is powerful for solving linear equations and inequalities. It automatically manipulates the given equation to solve for $x$. It knows that if $x/50 = 40$, then multiplying both sides by 50 gives $x = 2000$. This is a straightforward algebraic manipulation that Lean's automation can handle directly, so the proof is concise.

Therefore, the complete Lean 3 proof is:

```tactics

import Aesop

theorem mathd_algebra_24 (x : ℝ) (h₀ : x / 50 = 40) : x = 2000 := by 
  linarith
```

This proof demonstrates how Lean's automation can handle simple algebraic manipulations that would typically require several steps in a manual proof. The `linarith` tactic is particularly useful for goals involving linear equations and inequalities over real or integer variables.
