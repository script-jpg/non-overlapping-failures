The problem states that a snack-size tin of peaches has 40 calories and is 2% of a person's daily caloric requirement. We need to find the total number of calories in the daily requirement.

Let's denote the total daily calories as $x$. Since the tin is 2% of the daily requirement, we have $\frac{x}{50} = 40$ (because 2% is equivalent to $\frac{2}{100} = \frac{1}{50}$).

Starting from the equation $\frac{x}{50} = 40$, we can solve for $x$ by multiplying both sides by 50:
$x = 40 \times 50 = 2000$.

So the total daily caloric requirement is 2000 calories.

In Lean, we would formalize this as:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

We're importing the necessary libraries and opening namespaces for mathematical operations. The `maxHeartbeats 0` option allows Lean to run without limits on the number of steps, which is useful for simple arithmetic problems.

Now we'll define the theorem:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_24 (x : ℝ) (h₀ : x / 50 = 40) : x = 2000 := by
```

We have $x$ as a real number representing the total daily calories, and the hypothesis $h₀$ states that $\frac{x}{50} = 40$. We need to prove that $x = 2000$.

To solve $\frac{x}{50} = 40$ for $x$, we multiply both sides by 50:
$\frac{x}{50} \times 50 = 40 \times 50$
$x = 2000$

In Lean, we can solve this equation directly using the `linarith` tactic, which can handle linear arithmetic goals:

```tactics
linarith
```

The `linarith` tactic is powerful enough to solve goals involving linear equalities and inequalities. From $h₀ : x / 50 = 40$, it can multiply both sides by 50 to derive $x = 2000$ automatically, completing our proof.

So our complete solution is:
- We have the equation $\frac{x}{50} = 40$
- Multiplying both sides by 50 gives $x = 40 \times 50 = 2000$
- Therefore, the total daily caloric requirement is 2000 calories

This matches the boxed answer $\boxed{2000}$.
