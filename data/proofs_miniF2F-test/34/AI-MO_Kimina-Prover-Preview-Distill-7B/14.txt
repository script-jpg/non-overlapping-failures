So our complete proof is:

theorem mathd_algebra_24 (x : ℝ) (h₀ : x / 50 = 40) : x = 2000 := by
  linarith
```

This is a straightforward algebraic manipulation. We're told that $x / 50 = 40$, which means $x = 40 \cdot 50 = 2000$. The `linarith` tactic is powerful enough to solve this equation directly by multiplying both sides by 50.
