The problem states that a snack-size tin of peaches has 40 calories and is 2% of a person's daily caloric requirement. We need to find the total number of calories that make up the daily caloric requirement.

If 40 calories is 2% of the daily requirement, then we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{40}{x} = \frac{2}{100}
\]

where \( x \) is the total daily calories. Solving for \( x \), we get:

\[
40 \times 100 = 2 \times x
\]

\[
4000 = 2x
\]

\[
x = \frac{4000}{2} = 2000
\]

So the daily caloric requirement is 2000 calories.

The Lean proof translates this as follows:

We've imported the necessary libraries and opened namespaces to access mathematical definitions and lemmas.

Now we'll define the theorem:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_24 (x : ℝ) (h₀ : x / 50 = 40) : x = 2000 := by
```

We have a real number \( x \) representing the total daily calories, and the hypothesis \( h₀ \) states that \( x / 50 = 40 \). This comes from the fact that 40 calories is 2% of the daily requirement, so:

\[
\frac{x}{50} = 40
\]

This is because 2% is equivalent to dividing by 50 (since 1/0.02 = 50).

Now we solve for \( x \):

```tactics
linarith
```

The Lean tactic `linarith` is powerful enough to solve linear arithmetic goals. It's taking the equation \( x / 50 = 40 \) and multiplying both sides by 50 to get:

\[
x = 40 \times 50 = 2000
\]

Therefore, the total number of calories that make up the daily caloric requirement is 2000, which is our final answer.
