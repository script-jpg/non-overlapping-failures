Let me explain this step by step.

First, we're given that a snack-size tin of peaches has:
- 40 calories
- 2% of a person's daily caloric requirement

We need to find the total calories in a full person's daily requirement.

Let's start by formalizing what we know. We'll use `x` to represent the total calories in a person's daily requirement.

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

I've imported the necessary libraries, set the heartbeats to zero (allowing Lean to work as long as needed), and opened some common namespaces.

Now, let's state the theorem. We want to prove that if `x / 50 = 40`, then `x = 2000`.

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_24 (x : ℝ) (h₀ : x / 50 = 40) : x = 2000 := by
```

So far, I've declared the theorem with:
- A real number `x` representing the total calories in a person's daily requirement
- The assumption `h₀ : x / 50 = 40`, which means that 2% of `x` equals 40 calories

Now I need to solve the equation `x / 50 = 40` for `x`. This is a straightforward algebraic manipulation:
Multiply both sides by 50 to isolate `x`:
`x = 40 * 50`
`x = 2000`

Let's complete the proof in Lean:

```tactics
field_simp at h₀
linarith
```

The `field_simp` tactic simplifies expressions involving field operations, and `linarith` solves linear arithmetic problems. These two tactics together can solve the equation `x / 50 = 40` and verify that `x = 2000`.

Therefore, the total number of calories that fulfill a person's daily caloric requirement is 2000.

The key insight was that if 2% of the total requirement equals 40 calories, then the full requirement is 40 calories divided by 2%, which equals 2000 calories.
