/-- A person's daily caloric requirement is divided into three age groups.  The first group, ages 14-65 years, has a requirement of $1200$ calories.  This requirement is $150$ calories more than the requirement for the second group, ages 66-80 years.  The requirement for the third group, ages 81 years and over, is $200$ calories less than the requirement for the second group.  What is the total caloric requirement for all three age groups? -/
