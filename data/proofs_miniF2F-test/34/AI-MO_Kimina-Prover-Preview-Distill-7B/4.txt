This completes the proof. The key insight is that if 40 calories is 2% of the daily requirement, then the total daily requirement is 2000 calories. This is because 40 calories is 2% of 2000 calories, which is a standard fact about the peaches' calories and daily requirements.

The final answer is $ \boxed{ 2000 } $.
