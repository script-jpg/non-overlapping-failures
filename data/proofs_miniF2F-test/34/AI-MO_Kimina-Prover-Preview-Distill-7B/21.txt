The proof is straightforward: we have a variable $x$ representing the total number of calories in a person's daily requirement. We are given that a snack-size tin of peaches, which has 40 calories, is 2% of this requirement. 

Since 2% is equivalent to $\frac{2}{100} = \frac{1}{50}$, we can set up the equation $\frac{x}{50} = 40$. This equation states that when we take 1/50th of the total calories, we get 40 calories, which is exactly the information given.

From $\frac{x}{50} = 40$, we can multiply both sides by 50 to get $x = 40 \cdot 50$. Calculating this gives $x = 2000$. 

Therefore, a person's daily caloric requirement is 2000 calories. This matches the expected answer of $\boxed{2000}$.

The Lean proof follows this mathematical reasoning exactly. It starts by importing the necessary libraries and opening namespaces for real numbers, arithmetic operations, and topology (though topology isn't directly needed for this proof). 

The theorem statement declares that if $x$ is a real number such that $\frac{x}{50} = 40$, then $x = 2000$. The hypothesis `h₀ : x / 50 = 40` encodes our given information, and the conclusion `x = 2000` is what we want to prove.

The proof proceeds by first deriving that $x = 40 \cdot 50$ from our hypothesis. This is done using the `linarith` tactic, which is powerful enough to solve linear arithmetic goals. Given $\frac{x}{50} = 40$, it can multiply both sides by 50 to obtain $x = 40 \cdot 50$. 

Then, a second `linarith` tactic computes that $40 \cdot 50 = 2000$ and completes the proof by showing that $x = 2000$ follows from $x = 40 \cdot 50$.

This proof demonstrates how Lean's automation can solve simple algebraic equations that would typically require manual calculation in a traditional proof setting. The beauty of formal verification is that even these straightforward calculations can be confirmed with absolute certainty, leaving no room for human error in arithmetic.
