In this problem, we're told that a snack-size tin of peaches has 40 calories and that this is 2% of a person's daily caloric requirement. We need to find the total number of calories in the daily requirement.

First, let's think about how to translate this into an equation. If the tin is 2% of the daily requirement, then:

2% of total calories = 40 calories

Mathematically, if we let $x$ represent the total number of calories in the daily requirement, then:

$\frac{2}{100} \cdot x = 40$

This can be rewritten as:

$\frac{x}{50} = 40$

Now we need to solve this equation to find $x$.

In Lean 4, we'll start by setting up the problem:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

```

We've imported the necessary libraries and opened the relevant namespaces. The `maxHeartbeats 0` setting allows Lean to work as long as needed to solve the problem.

Now we'll define the theorem:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_24 (x : ℝ) (h₀ : x / 50 = 40) : x = 2000 := by
```

We have a real number $x$ representing the total calories, and we're given that $\frac{x}{50} = 40$. We need to prove that $x = 2000$.

To solve $\frac{x}{50} = 40$ for $x$, we multiply both sides by 50:

$x = 40 \cdot 50 = 2000$

In Lean, we can use the `linarith` tactic, which handles linear arithmetic goals:

```tactics
linarith
```

The `linarith` tactic is powerful enough to solve this equation directly. Given $x/50 = 40$, it can deduce that $x = 2000$ by multiplying both sides by 50. This completes the proof.

The key insight is that if 2% of the total calories equals 40, then the total calories must be 40 divided by 0.02, which is 2000. The Lean proof is elegant in its simplicity, directly applying the linear arithmetic solver to derive the conclusion from the given hypothesis.
