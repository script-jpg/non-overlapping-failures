The theorem states that if $x$ is the total number of calories in a person's daily requirement, and a snack-size tin of peaches has 40 calories which is 2% of the daily requirement, then $x = 2000$.

Let me explain the proof:
1. We have the equation $\frac{x}{50} = 40$, which comes from the fact that 2% of $x$ is $40$ calories. Since 2% is $\frac{2}{100} = \frac{1}{50}$, we have $\frac{x}{50} = 40$.
2. To solve for $x$, we multiply both sides by $50$: $x = 40 \cdot 50$.
3. Calculating $40 \cdot 50$ gives $2000$.
4. Therefore, $x = 2000$.

The Lean proof uses `field_simp` to manipulate the division in our hypothesis, and then `linarith` to solve the resulting linear equation. This confirms that the total number of calories in a person's daily requirement is indeed 2000.

The key insight is that if 40 calories is 2% of the daily requirement, then to find the total requirement, we can set up the equation $\frac{x}{50} = 40$, where $x$ is the total calories. This is because $\frac{1}{50} = 0.02$, and $40 = 0.02 \cdot x$.

So our complete answer is: To meet a person's daily caloric requirement, they need 2000 calories, confirming that $\boxed{2000}$ is indeed the final answer.
