The theorem states that if a snack-size tin of peaches has 40 calories and is 2% of a person's daily caloric requirement, then the total number of calories in the daily requirement is 2000. The proof is straightforward: if 40 calories is 2% of the daily requirement, then the total daily requirement is 40 calories / 2% = 2000 calories.

In the Lean proof, we see that we're working with a real number `x` that represents the total daily caloric requirement. The hypothesis `h₀` states that `x / 50 = 40`, which is another way of saying that 40 calories is 2% of the daily requirement (since 50 is 2% of 1000, and 40 is 2% of 2000).

From `h₀`, we can derive that `x = 40 * 50`, which is 2000. The Lean proof uses `linarith` to solve this linear arithmetic goal. After normalization by `norm_num`, we get `x = 2000`, which is then proved by `exact hx`.

This is a simple yet direct proof of the given algebra problem.
