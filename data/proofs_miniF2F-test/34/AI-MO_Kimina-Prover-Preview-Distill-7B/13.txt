The formal Lean 4 solution to the algebra problem is remarkably concise. Let me explain why this is the case and what the Lean code is doing.

The problem states: "If a snack-size tin of peaches has $40$ calories and is $2\%$ of a person's daily caloric requirement, how many calories fulfill a person's daily caloric requirement? Show that it is 2000."

In mathematical terms, we're given that $x/50 = 40$, where $x$ is the total number of calories in the daily requirement. The reasoning is that if 40 calories is 2% of the daily requirement, then we can set up the equation $\frac{x}{50} = 40$, because 2% is equivalent to $\frac{2}{100} = \frac{1}{50}$.

Let's break down the Lean 4 solution:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

These imports and the opening commands are setting up the necessary libraries and namespaces for working with real numbers and arithmetic operations in Lean. The `maxHeartbeats 0` option allows Lean to work with larger proofs without getting stuck in a loop.

Now, let's look at the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_24 (x : ℝ) (h₀ : x / 50 = 40) : x = 2000 := by
```

We have a real number $x$ representing the total calories in the daily requirement, and the hypothesis $h₀: x/50 = 40$ encodes that 40 calories is 2% of $x$ (since $x/50$ is the same as $\frac{1}{50}x$, which is 2% of $x$).

To solve for $x$, we need to multiply both sides of the equation $x/50 = 40$ by 50 to isolate $x$:
$\frac{x}{50} \cdot 50 = 40 \cdot 50$
$x = 2000$

In Lean, we can solve this directly using the `linarith` tactic, which is powerful for solving linear arithmetic goals:

```tactics
linarith
```

The `linarith` tactic is able to solve goals involving linear arithmetic expressions. In this case, it's working with the hypothesis $h₀: x/50 = 40$ and using the properties of real numbers to multiply both sides by 50 and prove that $x = 2000$.

The Lean proof is remarkably concise because the problem is a straightforward algebraic manipulation that Lean's automated tactic can handle without needing an explicit step-by-step breakdown. In a more complex proof, we might need to use additional tactics like `have` to establish intermediate facts, but for this direct relationship, `linarith` is sufficient.

In conclusion, the Lean 4 solution demonstrates that if $x/50 = 40$, then $x = 2000$, confirming that the total number of calories in the daily requirement is indeed 2000.
