This proof is quite straightforward. We have a real number $x$ representing the total calories in a person's daily requirement, and we're given that $x/50 = 40$, which means that a tin of peaches with 40 calories is 2% of the daily requirement (so 50 is 2% of the requirement, and thus the full requirement is 2500). 

Let's solve this algebraically to verify:
- We know $x/50 = 40$
- Multiplying both sides by 50: $x = 40 \cdot 50 = 2000$

So indeed, the total calories in a person's daily requirement is 2000. The Lean proof is simply solving this equation directly using linear arithmetic.

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

We begin by importing the necessary libraries and setting up the theorem. The `maxHeartbeats 0` option allows Lean to use as many computational steps as needed to solve the problem.

Now let's define the theorem:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_24 (x : ℝ) (h₀ : x / 50 = 40) : x = 2000 := by
```

We have a real number $x$ and the hypothesis $h₀ : x / 50 = 40$. We need to prove $x = 2000$.

To solve for $x$ from $x/50 = 40$, we multiply both sides by 50 to get $x = 40 \cdot 50 = 2000$. 

In Lean, we can use the `linarith` tactic, which is powerful enough to solve linear arithmetic goals:

```tactics
linarith
```

The `linarith` tactic is able to solve goals involving linear arithmetic. Given $x / 50 = 40$, it can multiply both sides by 50 to derive $x = 2000$ directly. This is a simple linear equation, and Lean's automation can handle it without further guidance.

Therefore, the complete proof is simply:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

theorem mathd_algebra_24 (x : ℝ) (h₀ : x / 50 = 40) : x = 2000 := by 
  linarith
```

This elegant proof demonstrates how Lean's automation can solve straightforward arithmetic problems. The key insight is that if $x/50 = 40$, then multiplying both sides by 50 gives $x = 2000$, which is exactly what the `linarith` tactic does.
