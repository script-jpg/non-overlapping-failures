The `field_simp` tactic simplifies field expressions, and `linarith` solves linear arithmetic problems. These tactics work together to solve the equation and prove that $x = 2000$.

The key insight in this problem is that if 40 calories represent 2% of a daily requirement, then we can set up a proportion to find the total calories in the daily requirement. The proportion is $\frac{40 \text{ calories}}{x \text{ calories}} = \frac{2\%}{100\%}$. Solving for $x$ when $x / 50 = 40$ essentially captures this proportional relationship, where $x$ represents the total calories in the daily requirement. The equation $x / 50 = 40$ is another way of expressing that $x$ is 2% of the total calories (where 50 represents 100% as a multiple of 2%, essentially a conversion factor).

So the Lean proof is formalizing the solution to the equation $\frac{x}{50} = 40$, which is $x = 40 \times 50 = 2000$.

In conclusion, we have shown that if a snack-size tin of peaches has 40 calories and is 2% of a person's daily caloric requirement, then the total number of calories that fulfill the daily requirement is indeed 2000. This matches our expected answer of $\boxed{2000}$.
