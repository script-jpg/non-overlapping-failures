The theorem states that if $x/50 = 40$, then $x = 2000$. Let's break down the problem and solve it step by step.

First, let's understand what the problem is asking:
- A snack-size tin of peaches has 40 calories
- This is 2% of a person's daily caloric requirement
- We need to find the total number of calories in the daily requirement

If 40 calories is 2% of the daily requirement, we can set up the equation:
$\frac{40}{x} = \frac{2}{100}$ where $x$ is the daily caloric requirement.

Cross-multiplying gives:
$40 \cdot 100 = 2 \cdot x$
$4000 = 2x$
$x = \frac{4000}{2} = 2000$

So the daily caloric requirement is 2000 calories.

Now, let's solve this using Lean 4:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

We've imported the necessary libraries and opened namespaces for our work. The `maxHeartbeats 0` setting allows Lean to run without limits on the number of steps, which is useful for straightforward problems like this.

Now, let's define the theorem:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_24 (x : ℝ) (h₀ : x / 50 = 40) : x = 2000 := by
```

So we have $x/50 = 40$, and we need to prove $x = 2000$.

To solve for $x$, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 50:
$\frac{x}{50} \cdot 50 = 40 \cdot 50$
$x = 2000$

In Lean, we can use the `linarith` tactic, which is powerful for solving linear arithmetic goals:

```tactics
linarith
```

The `linarith` tactic is able to solve goals involving linear arithmetic. It will:
1. Take the hypothesis `h₀ : x / 50 = 40`
2. Multiply both sides by 50 to get `x = 2000`
3. Verify that this is indeed the only solution

Therefore, our complete proof is:
- We have the equation $x/50 = 40$
- Multiplying both sides by 50 gives $x = 2000$
- This is the only solution to the equation
- Therefore, $x = 2000$ is the answer

The Lean proof is elegant in its simplicity because the problem is a direct application of basic algebra. The theorem statement captures the essence of the problem: if $x/50 = 40$, then $x = 2000$. The `linarith` tactic is powerful enough to solve this directly without requiring further steps.
