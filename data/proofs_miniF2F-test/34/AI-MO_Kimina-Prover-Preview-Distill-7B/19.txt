So in summary, we have proven that if a snack-size tin of peaches has 40 calories and is 2% of a person's daily caloric requirement, then the total number of calories that meet the daily caloric requirement is 2000.

The Lean proof works by:
1. Understanding the relationship between the given equation `x / 50 = 40` and the problem statement
2. Using algebraic manipulation to solve for x, which represents the total calories in the daily requirement
3. Verifying that x = 2000, which is the expected answer

The Lean tactics `field_simp` and `linarith` handle the arithmetic operations needed to solve the equation. The `field_simp` tactic simplifies expressions involving field operations, while `linarith` solves linear arithmetic goals. Together, they can solve equations like `x / 50 = 40` to derive that `x = 2000`.
