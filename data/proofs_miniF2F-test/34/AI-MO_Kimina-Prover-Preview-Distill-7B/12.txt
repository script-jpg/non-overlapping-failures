In this problem, we're given that a snack-size tin of peaches has 40 calories and that this is 2% of a person's daily caloric requirement. We need to find the total number of calories in the daily requirement.

First, let's think about how to set up the problem. We're given:
- 40 calories in a tin of peaches
- This is 2% of the daily requirement

We need to find the total daily calories.

If we let $x$ be the total daily calories, then 2% of $x$ is $0.02x$. We're given that $0.02x = 40$.

To solve for $x$, we can multiply both sides by 50 (which is $1/0.02$):
$x = 40 \times 50 = 2000$

Now, let's translate this to Lean. We'll start by importing the necessary libraries:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

```

We're importing Mathlib for mathematical tools and Aesop for automated proof capabilities. The `maxHeartbeats 0` option means Lean will try as hard as possible to solve the problem. We're opening various namespaces for convenient access to mathematical definitions and theorems.

Next, we'll define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_24 (x : ℝ) (h₀ : x / 50 = 40) : x = 2000 := by
```

We have:
- `x : ℝ` is the total daily calories (a real number)
- `h₀ : x / 50 = 40` represents the equation from the problem statement
- We need to prove `x = 2000`

Solving the equation `x / 50 = 40` for `x`:
Multiply both sides by 50: `x = 40 * 50 = 2000`

In Lean, we can use the `linarith` tactic to solve this linear arithmetic problem:

```tactics
linarith
```

The `linarith` tactic is powerful for solving linear arithmetic goals. It will:
1. Take the hypothesis `h₀ : x / 50 = 40`
2. Rewrite it to `x = 40 * 50`
3. Compute `40 * 50 = 2000`
4. Conclude that `x = 2000`, which is exactly our goal

The Lean proof is remarkably concise because the problem is a straightforward algebraic manipulation that `linarith` can solve automatically. The equation `x / 50 = 40` directly translates to `x = 40 * 50` when multiplied by 50, and Lean's arithmetic solver can compute this to get `x = 2000`.

Therefore, the complete answer is 2000 calories.
