The theorem states that if $x$ is a real number such that $x/50 = 40$, then $x = 2000$. This is a straightforward linear equation that can be solved by multiplying both sides by 50. The equation $x/50 = 40$ means that $x$ is 40 times 50, which is 2000. The Lean proof uses `linarith` to solve the equation directly.

In more detail, the equation $x/50 = 40$ can be rewritten as $x = 40 \cdot 50$. Calculating the right-hand side, we get $40 \cdot 50 = 2000$. Therefore, $x = 2000$.

The Lean code:
- Import the necessary libraries
- Define the theorem with the given condition and conclusion
- Use `linarith` to solve the linear equation

The theorem is now proved, showing that if $x/50 = 40$, then $x = 2000$. This confirms that the total daily caloric requirement is 2000 calories, as 40 calories is 2% of 2000.
