  Given that a snack-size tin of peaches has 40 calories and this amount is 2% of a person's daily caloric requirement, we need to determine the total calories in a person's daily caloric requirement. We start with the equation \( \frac{x}{50} = 40 \). To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 50, resulting in \( x = 2000 \).

  -- We start with the given equation x / 50 = 40.
  have h₁ : x / 50 = 40 := h₀
  -- To solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by 50.
  have h₂ : x = 40 * 50 := by linarith
  -- Simplifying the right-hand side, we find x = 2000.
