 Given that a snack-size tin of peaches contains 40 calories and represents 2% of a person's daily caloric requirement, we need to determine the total calories in a person's daily caloric requirement. We are given the equation \( \frac{x}{50} = 40 \), where \( x \) represents the total calories in a person's daily caloric requirement. To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 50, resulting in \( x = 2000 \).
  -/
  -- We start by isolating x in the given equation x / 50 = 40.
  have h₁ : x = 40 * 50 := by
    -- Multiply both sides of the equation by 50 to solve for x.
