  Given that a snack-size tin of peaches has 40 calories and is 2% of a person's daily caloric requirement, we need to determine the daily caloric requirement. We start with the equation \( \frac{x}{50} = 40 \), where \( x \) represents the daily caloric requirement. To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 50, resulting in \( x = 40 \times 50 \). Simplifying the right-hand side, we find \( x = 2000 \).
