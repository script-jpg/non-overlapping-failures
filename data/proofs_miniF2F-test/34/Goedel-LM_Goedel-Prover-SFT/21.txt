  Given that a snack-size tin of peaches has 40 calories and is 2% of a person's daily caloric requirement, we need to determine how many calories fulfill a person's daily caloric requirement. We start with the equation \( \frac{x}{50} = 40 \), where \( x \) represents the total calories in the tin. To solve for \( x \), we first rewrite the equation as \( x = 40 \times 50 \). This step involves multiplying both sides of the equation by 50 to isolate \( x \) on one side. Finally, we compute the right-hand side to find that \( x = 2000 \).
