  Given that a snack-size tin of peaches contains 40 calories and this amount is 2% of a person's daily caloric requirement, we need to determine the total calories in a person's daily caloric requirement. We are given the equation \( \frac{x}{50} = 40 \), where \( x \) represents the total calories in a person's daily caloric requirement. To solve for \( x \), we first isolate \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 50. This yields \( x = 40 \times 50 \). Simplifying the right-hand side, we find \( x = 2000 \).

  -- To solve for x, we start by isolating x in the equation x / 50 = 40.
  -- Multiply both sides by 50 to get x = 40 * 50.
