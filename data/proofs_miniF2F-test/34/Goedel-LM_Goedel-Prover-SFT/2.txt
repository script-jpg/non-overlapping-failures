  Given that a snack-size tin of peaches contains 40 calories and is 2% of a person's daily caloric requirement, we need to determine how many calories would fill a person's daily caloric requirement. We are given that \( \frac{x}{50} = 40 \), where \( x \) represents the total calories. To find \( x \), we first isolate \( x \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 50. This gives us \( x = 40 \times 50 \). Performing the multiplication, we find \( x = 2000 \).

  -- We need to solve for x in the equation x / 50 = 40.
  have h₁ : x = 2000 := by
    -- Multiply both sides of the equation by 50 to isolate x.
    have h₁ : x = 40 * 50 := by

    -- Now we have x = 40 * 50, which simplifies to x = 2000.

  -- The final result is x = 2000.
