  Given that a snack-size tin of peaches has 40 calories and is 2% of a person's daily caloric requirement, we need to determine how many calories fulfill a person's daily caloric requirement. We are given that \( \frac{x}{50} = 40 \). To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 50, resulting in \( x = 40 \times 50 \). Simplifying the right-hand side, we get \( x = 2000 \).

  -- To solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation x / 50 = 40 by 50.

  -- Using the property that if a / b = c, then a = b * c, we rewrite the equation.

  -- Simplifying the right-hand side, we get x = 2000.
