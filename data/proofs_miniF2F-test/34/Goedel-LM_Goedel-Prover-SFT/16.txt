  Given that a snack-size tin of peaches contains 40 calories and represents 2% of a person's daily caloric requirement, we need to determine the total calories required per day. We start by setting up the equation based on the given information:
  1. Let \( x \) be the total calories required per day.
  2. We know that \( x / 50 = 40 \).
  To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 50:
  \[ x = 40 \times 50 \]
  Calculating the right-hand side, we find:
  \[ x = 2000 \]
  Thus, the total calories required per day is 2000.

  -- We need to solve for x in the equation x / 50 = 40.
  have h₁ : x = 2000 := by
    -- Multiply both sides of the equation by 50 to isolate x.
    apply Eq.symm
    -- Use the fact that 50 is non-zero to multiply both sides by 50.
