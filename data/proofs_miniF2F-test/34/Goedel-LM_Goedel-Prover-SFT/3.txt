  Given that a snack-size tin of peaches has 40 calories and this amount is 2% of a person's daily caloric requirement, we need to determine the total calories required for a person's daily caloric requirement. We are given that \( \frac{x}{50} = 40 \). To solve for \( x \), we first clear the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 50. This gives us \( x = 40 \times 50 \). Simplifying the right-hand side, we find \( x = 2000 \).
