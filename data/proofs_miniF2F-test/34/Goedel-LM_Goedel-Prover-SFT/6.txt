  Given that a snack-size tin of peaches contains 40 calories and represents 2% of a person's daily caloric requirement, we need to determine the total calories that fulfill a person's daily caloric requirement. We start by setting up the equation based on the given information:
  \[ \frac{x}{50} = 40 \]
  To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 50:
  \[ x = 40 \times 50 \]
  Simplifying the right-hand side, we find:
  \[ x = 2000 \]
  Thus, the total calories that fulfill a person's daily caloric requirement is 2000.

  -- We need to solve the equation x / 50 = 40 for x.
  -- Multiply both sides by 50 to isolate x on one side.

  -- Simplify the equation to find the value of x.
  -- x / 50 * 50 = 40 * 50 simplifies to x = 2000.
