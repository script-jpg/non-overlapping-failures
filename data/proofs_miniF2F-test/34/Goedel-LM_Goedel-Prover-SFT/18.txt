  Given that a snack-size tin of peaches has 40 calories and represents 2% of a person's daily caloric requirement, we need to determine the total calories in a person's daily caloric requirement. We start with the equation \( \frac{x}{50} = 40 \), where \( x \) represents the total calories. To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 50 to isolate \( x \) on one side. This gives us \( x = 40 \times 50 \). Simplifying the right-hand side, we find \( x = 2000 \).

  -- To find the total calories (x) in a person's daily caloric requirement, we solve the equation x/50 = 40.
  -- Multiplying both sides by 50 to isolate x, we get x = 40 * 50.

  -- Simplifying the right-hand side, we find x = 2000.
