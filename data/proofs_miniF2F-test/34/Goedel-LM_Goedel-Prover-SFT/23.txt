  Given that a snack-size tin of peaches contains 40 calories and this amount represents 2% of a person's daily caloric requirement, we need to determine the total calories required per day. We start by setting up the equation based on the given information: \( \frac{x}{50} = 40 \). To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 50 to isolate \( x \). This gives us \( x = 40 \times 50 \). Performing the multiplication, we find \( x = 2000 \).

  -- We start with the given equation x / 50 = 40.
  have h₁ : x = 40 * 50 := by
    -- To solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by 50.

  -- Verify that 40 * 50 equals 2000.
