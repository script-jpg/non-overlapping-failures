  Given that a snack-size tin of peaches contains 40 calories and is 2% of a person's daily caloric requirement, we need to determine the daily caloric requirement. We start by setting up the equation \( \frac{x}{50} = 40 \), where \( x \) represents the daily caloric requirement. To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 50, resulting in \( x = 40 \times 50 \). Performing the multiplication, we find \( x = 2000 \).

  -- We start with the given equation x / 50 = 40
  have h₁ : x / 50 = 40 := by assumption
  -- To solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by 50
  have h₂ : x = 40 * 50 := by linarith
  -- Performing the multiplication, we find x = 2000
