  Given that a snack-size tin of peaches contains 40 calories and represents 2% of a person's daily caloric requirement, we need to determine how many calories meet a person's daily caloric requirement. We are given that \( x / 50 = 40 \). To find \( x \), we first rewrite the equation by multiplying both sides by 50 to isolate \( x \). This gives us \( x = 40 \times 50 \). Simplifying the right-hand side, we find \( x = 2000 \).
  -/
  -- To find x, we solve the equation x / 50 = 40 by multiplying both sides by 50.
  have h₁ : x = 40 * 50 := by
    -- Multiply both sides of the equation x / 50 = 40 by 50 to isolate x.
    rw [← mul_right_inj' (show (50 : ℝ) ≠ 0 by norm_num)] at h₀
    -- Simplify the equation to solve for x.
    linarith
  -- Substitute the value of x from h₁ into the goal.
  rw [h₁]
  -- Verify that 40 * 50 equals 2000.
