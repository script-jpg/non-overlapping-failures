  Given that a snack-size tin of peaches has 40 calories and is 2% of a person's daily caloric requirement, we need to determine the total calories in a person's daily caloric requirement. We start by setting up the equation based on the given percentage: \( \frac{x}{50} = 40 \). To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 50, resulting in \( x = 40 \times 50 \). Simplifying the right-hand side, we find \( x = 2000 \).
