  Given that a snack-size tin of peaches has 40 calories and represents 2% of a person's daily caloric requirement, we need to determine the total calories required to meet the daily caloric requirement. We start with the equation \( \frac{x}{50} = 40 \), where \( x \) represents the total calories. To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 50. This gives us \( x = 40 \times 50 \). Simplifying the right-hand side, we find \( x = 2000 \).

  -- To solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation x / 50 = 40 by 50.
  have h₁ : x = 40 * 50 := by
    -- Using the fact that 50 is non-zero, we can safely multiply both sides by 50.
    rw [← mul_right_inj' (show (50 : ℝ) ≠ 0 by norm_num)]
    -- This step simplifies the equation to x = 40 * 50.

  -- Now we have x = 40 * 50, which simplifies to x = 2000.
