  To determine the number of solutions to the equation \(\tan(2x) = \cos\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)\) on the interval \([0, 2\pi]\), we start by analyzing the given equation. We need to find the values of \(x\) that satisfy this equation within the specified interval.
  1. **Understanding the Equation**:
     \[
     \tan(2x) = \cos\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)
     \]
     This equation implies a relationship between the tangent of \(2x\) and the cosine of \(\frac{x}{2}\).
  2. **Interval Analysis**:
     We need to check if there are any values of \(x\) in the interval \([0, 2\pi]\) that satisfy the equation.
  3. **Solution Verification**:
     - For \(x = 0\), \(\tan(0) = 0\) and \(\cos(0) = 1\), so \(\tan(2 \cdot 0) = \cos(0/2)\).
     - For \(x = \pi\), \(\tan(2\pi) = 0\) and \(\cos(\pi/2) = 0\), so \(\tan(2 \cdot \pi) = \cos(\pi)\).
     - For \(x = 2\pi\), \(\tan(4\pi) = 0\) and \(\cos(2\pi/2) = 1\), so \(\tan(4\pi) = \cos(2\pi)\).
  4. **Conclusion**:
     - The values \(x = 0, \pi, 2\pi\) satisfy the equation \(\tan(2x) = \cos(x/2)\) within the interval \([0, 2\pi]\).
     - Therefore, the number of solutions is 3.
