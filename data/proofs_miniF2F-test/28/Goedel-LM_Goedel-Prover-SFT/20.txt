  Given the equation \(2x^2 = 4x + 9\), we need to find the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(x = \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{c}\) and \(a + b + c = 26\).
  1. Substitute \(x = \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{2}\) into the equation \(2x^2 = 4x + 9\).
  2. Simplify the equation to isolate terms involving \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).
  3. Solve for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) using the simplified equation.
