  Given \( x \) is a positive number such that \( 2x^2 = 4x + 9 \), we can express \( x \) in the simplified form as \( \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{c} \) where \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are positive integers. We need to show that \( a + b + c = 26 \).
  First, we solve the quadratic equation \( 2x^2 - 4x - 9 = 0 \). We can solve this using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 2 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -9 \):
  \[
  x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot (-9)}}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 72}}{4} = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{88}}{4} = \frac{4 \pm 2\sqrt{22}}{4} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{22}}{2}
  \]
  Thus, the solutions are \( x = 1 + \frac{\sqrt{22}}{2} \) and \( x = 1 - \frac{\sqrt{22}}{2} \). Since \( x \) must be in the simplified form \( \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{c} \), we identify \( a = 1 \), \( b = 22 \), and \( c = 2 \).
  Finally, we calculate \( a + b + c \):
  \[
  a + b + c = 1 + 22 + 2 = 25
  \]
