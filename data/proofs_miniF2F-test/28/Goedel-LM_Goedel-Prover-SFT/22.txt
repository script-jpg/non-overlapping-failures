  Given \( x \) is a positive number such that \( 2x^2 = 4x + 9 \), and \( x \) can be expressed in the simplified form as \( \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{c} \) where \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are positive integers, we need to find \( a + b + c \).
  First, we solve the equation \( 2x^2 = 4x + 9 \):
  \[ 2x^2 - 4x - 9 = 0 \]
  Next, we use the fact that \( x = \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{c} \) and substitute \( c = 2 \):
  \[ x = \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{2} \]
  We substitute \( x \) into the original equation:
  \[ 2 \left( \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{2} \right)^2 = 4 \left( \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{2} \right) + 9 \]
  Simplifying both sides:
  \[ 2 \left( \frac{(a + \sqrt{b})^2}{4} \right) = 4 \left( \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{2} \right) + 9 \]
  \[ \frac{(a + \sqrt{b})^2}{2} = 2(a + \sqrt{b}) + 9 \]
  \[ (a + \sqrt{b})^2 = 4(a + \sqrt{b}) + 18 \]
  Expanding and simplifying:
  \[ a^2 + 2a\sqrt{b} + b = 4a + 4\sqrt{b} + 18 \]
  \[ a^2 + 2a\sqrt{b} + b - 4a - 4\sqrt{b} = 18 \]
  \[ a^2 - 4a + b - 2a\sqrt{b} - 4\sqrt{b} = 18 \]
  Given \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are positive integers, we solve for \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) such that the equation holds true. By inspection and solving the system of equations, we find:
  \[ a = 3, \quad b = 12, \quad c = 2 \]
  Thus, \( a + b + c = 3 + 12 + 2 = 17 \).
