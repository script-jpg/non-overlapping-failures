  Given \( x \) is a positive number such that \( 2x^2 = 4x + 9 \), and \( x \) can be written in the simplified form as \( \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{c} \) where \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are positive integers, we need to find the value of \( a + b + c \).
  First, we solve the equation \( 2x^2 = 4x + 9 \). Rearranging this equation, we get:
  \[ 2x^2 - 4x - 9 = 0 \]
  Next, we solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 2 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -9 \):
  \[ x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 72}}{4} = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{88}}{4} = \frac{4 \pm 2\sqrt{22}}{4} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{22}}{2} \]
  Since \( x \) is positive, we take the positive root:
  \[ x = 1 + \frac{\sqrt{22}}{2} \]
  Now, we need to find \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) such that \( x = \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{c} \). By comparing the coefficients, we get:
  \[ a = 1, \quad b = 22, \quad c = 2 \]
  Finally, we calculate \( a + b + c \):
  \[ a + b + c = 1 + 22 + 2 = 25 \]
  Thus, the value of \( a + b + c \) is \( 26 \).
