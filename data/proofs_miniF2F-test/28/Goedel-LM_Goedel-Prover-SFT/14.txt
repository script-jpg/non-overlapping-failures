  Given \( x \) is a positive number such that \( 2x^2 = 4x + 9 \), and \( x \) can be written in the form \( \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{c} \) where \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are positive integers, we need to show that \( a + b + c = 26 \).
  First, we simplify the given equation \( 2x^2 = 4x + 9 \). By rearranging terms, we get:
  \[ 2x^2 - 4x - 9 = 0 \]
  Next, we solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \). Here, \( a = 2 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -9 \).
  Calculating the discriminant:
  \[ \Delta = b^2 - 4ac = (-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot (-9) = 16 + 72 = 88 \]
  Thus, the solutions are:
  \[ x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{88}}{4} = \frac{4 \pm 2\sqrt{22}}{4} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{22}}{2} \]
  Since \( x \) is positive, we choose \( x = 1 + \frac{\sqrt{22}}{2} \).
  Given \( x = \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{c} \), we equate the expressions:
  \[ 1 + \frac{\sqrt{22}}{2} = \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{2} \]
  By comparing the numerators and denominators, we get:
  \[ a = 1, \quad \sqrt{b} = \sqrt{22}, \quad c = 2 \]
  Thus, \( a + b + c = 1 + 22 + 2 = 25 \).
