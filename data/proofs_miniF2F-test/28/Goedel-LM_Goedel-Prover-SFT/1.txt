  Given \( x \) is a positive number such that \( 2x^2 = 4x + 9 \), and \( x \) can be written in simplified form as \( \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{c} \) where \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are positive integers, we need to find \( a + b + c \).
  First, we solve the equation \( 2x^2 = 4x + 9 \):
  \[ 2x^2 - 4x - 9 = 0 \]
  Next, we solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \):
  \[ a = 2, \quad b = -4, \quad c = -9 \]
  \[ x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 72}}{4} = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{88}}{4} = \frac{4 \pm 2\sqrt{22}}{4} = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{22}}{2} \]
  Given \( x = \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{c} \), we equate the expressions:
  \[ \frac{2 + \sqrt{22}}{2} = \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{c} \]
  By comparing coefficients, we get:
  \[ a = 2, \quad b = 22, \quad c = 2 \]
  Thus, \( a + b + c = 2 + 22 + 2 = 26 \).
