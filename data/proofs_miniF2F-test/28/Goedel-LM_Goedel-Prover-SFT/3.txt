  Given \( x \) as a positive number such that \( 2x^2 = 4x + 9 \), we need to find \( x \) in the form \( \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{c} \) where \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are positive integers and determine \( a + b + c \).
  First, we solve the quadratic equation \( 2x^2 = 4x + 9 \):
  \[ 2x^2 - 4x - 9 = 0 \]
  Next, we use the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \) where \( a = 2 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -9 \):
  \[ x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 72}}{4} = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{88}}{4} = \frac{4 \pm 2\sqrt{22}}{4} = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{22}}{2} \]
  Thus, the solutions are:
  \[ x = 1 + \frac{\sqrt{22}}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad x = 1 - \frac{\sqrt{22}}{2} \]
  Since \( x \) is positive, we have:
  \[ x = 1 + \frac{\sqrt{22}}{2} \]
  Given \( x = \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{c} \) where \( c = 2 \):
  \[ 1 + \frac{\sqrt{22}}{2} = \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{2} \]
  Multiplying both sides by 2:
  \[ 2 + \sqrt{22} = a + \sqrt{b} \]
  Equating coefficients of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
  \[ a = 2 \]
  \[ b = 22 \]
  \[ c = 2 \]
  Thus, \( a + b + c = 2 + 22 + 2 = 26 \).
