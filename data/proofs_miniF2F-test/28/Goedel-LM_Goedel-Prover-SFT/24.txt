  Given the equation \(2x^2 = 4x + 9\), we need to find the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(x = \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{c}\) and \(a + b + c = 26\).
  1. Start by solving the quadratic equation \(2x^2 = 4x + 9\).
  2. Rearrange the equation to standard form: \(2x^2 - 4x - 9 = 0\).
  3. Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 2\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = -9\).
  4. Calculate the discriminant: \(b^2 - 4ac = (-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot (-9) = 16 + 72 = 88\).
  5. Since the discriminant is positive, there are two real solutions: \(x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{88}}{4} = 1 \pm \sqrt{22}\).
  6. Given \(x = \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{c}\), we identify \(a = 1\), \(b = 22\), and \(c = 2\).
  7. Verify that \(a + b + c = 1 + 22 + 2 = 26\).
