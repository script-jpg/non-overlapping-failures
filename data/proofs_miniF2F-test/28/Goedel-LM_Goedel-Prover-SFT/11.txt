  Given \( x \) is a positive number such that \( 2x^2 = 4x + 9 \), and \( x \) can be written in the form \( \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{c} \) where \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are positive integers, we need to find \( a + b + c \) and show that it equals 26.
  First, we start by substituting \( x = \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{c} \) into the equation \( 2x^2 = 4x + 9 \). We then simplify and solve for \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \). Given \( c = 2 \), we substitute and solve the resulting equations to find \( a \) and \( b \). Finally, we sum \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) to verify that their sum is 26.
