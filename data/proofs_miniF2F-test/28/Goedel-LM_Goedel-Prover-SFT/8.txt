  Given the equation \(2x^2 = 4x + 9\), we need to find the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(x = \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{c}\) and \(a + b + c = 26\). We will show that \(a = 5\), \(b = 15\), and \(c = 2\) satisfy these conditions.
  First, substitute \(x = \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{c}\) into the equation \(2x^2 = 4x + 9\). Simplify the expression step by step to match the given form.
  1. Substitute \(x = \frac{a + \sqrt{b}}{c}\) into \(2x^2 = 4x + 9\).
  2. Simplify the left-hand side and the right-hand side separately.
  3. Equate the simplified forms to find \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).
  4. Verify that \(a + b + c = 26\).
