-- Let's begin by analyzing the problem. We have:
  -- 1. A positive number x satisfying 2x^2 = 4x + 9
  -- 2. x can be written in the form (a + √b)/c with a, b, c positive integers
  -- 3. We need to find a + b + c

  have : 2 * x ^ 2 - (4 * x + 9) = 0 := by linarith

  -- Rearranging the equation: 2x^2 - 4x - 9 = 0
  have : 2 * (x * x) + (-4) * x + (-9) = 0 := by linarith

  -- This is a quadratic equation in x. Let's use the quadratic formula:
  -- If ax^2 + bx + c = 0, then x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a
  -- Here: a = 2, b = -4, c = -9
  have : x = (4 + Real.sqrt ((-4) ^ 2 - 4 * 2 * (-9))) / (2 * 2) ∨ x = (4 - Real.sqrt ((-4) ^ 2 - 4 * 2 * (-9))) / (2 * 2) := by

    -- Using the quadratic formula
    have : 2 * (x * x) + (-4) * x + (-9) = 2 * (x - (4 + Real.sqrt ((-4) ^ 2 - 4 * 2 * (-9))) / (2 * 2)) * (x - (4 - Real.sqrt ((-4) ^ 2 - 4 * 2 * (-9))) / (2 * 2)) := by
