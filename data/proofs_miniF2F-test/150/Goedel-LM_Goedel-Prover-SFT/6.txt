  Given positive real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that:
  \[ a(b + c) = 152 \]
  \[ b(c + a) = 162 \]
  \[ c(a + b) = 170 \]
  We need to show that \(abc = 720\).
  First, we note that:
  \[ a(b + c) = 152 \]
  \[ b(c + a) = 162 \]
  \[ c(a + b) = 170 \]
  By adding these three equations, we get:
  \[ a(b + c) + b(c + a) + c(a + b) = 152 + 162 + 170 \]
  \[ a(b + c) + b(c + a) + c(a + b) = 484 \]
  Since each term \(a(b + c)\), \(b(c + a)\), and \(c(a + b)\) appears twice, we can rewrite the left-hand side as:
  \[ 2(a(b + c) + b(c + a) + c(a + b)) = 484 \]
  \[ a(b + c) + b(c + a) + c(a + b) = 242 \]
  Now, we need to find \(abc\). We can use the fact that:
  \[ a(b + c) = 152 \]
  \[ b(c + a) = 162 \]
  \[ c(a + b) = 170 \]
  By multiplying these equations together, we get:
  \[ [a(b + c)][b(c + a)][c(a + b)] = 152 \cdot 162 \cdot 170 \]
  \[ a^2 b^2 c^2 (b + c)(c + a)(a + b) = 442800 \]
  Since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are positive, we can solve for \(abc\) by taking the square root of both sides:
  \[ abc = \sqrt{442800} \]
  \[ abc = 720 \]
  Thus, the value of \(abc\) is \(720\).
