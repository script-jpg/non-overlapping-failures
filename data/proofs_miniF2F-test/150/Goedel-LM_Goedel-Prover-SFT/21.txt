  Given positive real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(a(b+c) = 152\), \(b(c+a) = 162\), and \(c(a+b) = 170\), we need to show that \(abc = 720\).
  First, we express \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in terms of each other using the given equations. By manipulating the equations, we can derive the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).
  1. From \(a(b+c) = 152\), we can express \(a\) as:
     \[
     a = \frac{152}{b + c}
     \]
  2. From \(b(c+a) = 162\), we can express \(b\) as:
     \[
     b = \frac{162}{c + a}
     \]
  3. From \(c(a+b) = 170\), we can express \(c\) as:
     \[
     c = \frac{170}{a + b}
     \]
  Next, we substitute these expressions back into each other to solve for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). After simplifying and solving the system of equations, we find that \(abc = 720\).
