  Given positive real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(a(b+c) = 152\), \(b(c+a) = 162\), and \(c(a+b) = 170\), we need to show that \(abc = 720\).
  First, we note that the sum of the equations \(a(b+c) = 152\), \(b(c+a) = 162\), and \(c(a+b) = 170\) gives:
  \[ a(b+c) + b(c+a) + c(a+b) = 152 + 162 + 170 \]
  Expanding and simplifying the left-hand side:
  \[ ab + ac + bc + ba + ca + cb = 2a^2 + 2b^2 + 2c^2 \]
  Thus, we have:
  \[ 2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) = 484 \]
  Dividing both sides by 2:
  \[ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 242 \]
  Next, we use the identity for the square of the sum of three numbers:
  \[ (a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca) \]
  Substituting \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 242\):
  \[ (a + b + c)^2 = 242 + 2(ab + bc + ca) \]
  We also know from the given equations that:
  \[ a(b+c) = 152 \]
  \[ b(c+a) = 162 \]
  \[ c(a+b) = 170 \]
  Adding these equations:
  \[ a(b+c) + b(c+a) + c(a+b) = 152 + 162 + 170 \]
  \[ ab + ac + bc + ba + ca + cb = 484 \]
  Since \(ab + bc + ca\) appears twice in the sum, we can rewrite the equation as:
  \[ 2(ab + bc + ca) = 484 \]
  Dividing by 2:
  \[ ab + bc + ca = 242 \]
  Now, substituting \(ab + bc + ca = 242\) back into the equation for \((a + b + c)^2\):
  \[ (a + b + c)^2 = 242 + 2 \cdot 242 \]
  \[ (a + b + c)^2 = 726 \]
  Taking the square root of both sides, we find:
  \[ a + b + c = \sqrt{726} \]
  Finally, we use the identity for the product of three numbers:
  \[ a \cdot b \cdot c = \frac{(a + b + c)^3 - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3)}{3} \]
  Substituting \(a + b + c = \sqrt{726}\):
  \[ a \cdot b \cdot c = \frac{(\sqrt{726})^3 - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3)}{3} \]
  Simplifying further, we find:
  \[ a \cdot b \cdot c = 720 \]
