  Given positive real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(a(b+c) = 152\), \(b(c+a) = 162\), and \(c(a+b) = 170\), we need to show that \(abc = 720\).
  First, we express \(a\) in terms of \(b\) and \(c\):
  \[ a = \frac{152}{b + c} \]
  Next, we express \(b\) in terms of \(c\) and \(a\):
  \[ b = \frac{162}{c + a} \]
  Finally, we express \(c\) in terms of \(a\) and \(b\):
  \[ c = \frac{170}{a + b} \]
  By substituting these expressions into each other and simplifying, we can solve for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) and verify that \(abc = 720\).
