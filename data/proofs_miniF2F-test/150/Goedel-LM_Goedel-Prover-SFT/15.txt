  Given positive real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(a(b+c) = 152\), \(b(c+a) = 162\), and \(c(a+b) = 170\), we need to show that \(abc = 720\).
  First, we use the given equations to express \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in terms of each other. By manipulating these equations, we can derive the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) and then verify that their product equals 720.
