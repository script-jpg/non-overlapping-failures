  Given positive real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(a(b+c) = 152\), \(b(c+a) = 162\), and \(c(a+b) = 170\), we need to show that \(abc = 720\).
  First, we use the given equations to derive a system of equations that can be solved for the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). By manipulating these equations, we can isolate each variable and find their values. Finally, we substitute these values back into the expression for \(abc\) to verify that it equals 720.
