  Given positive real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(a(b+c) = 152\), \(b(c+a) = 162\), and \(c(a+b) = 170\), we need to show that \(abc = 720\).
  First, we note that the sum of the products of the pairs of variables is:
  \[ a(b+c) + b(c+a) + c(a+b) = 152 + 162 + 170 \]
  Expanding and simplifying the left-hand side, we get:
  \[ ab + ac + bc + ba + ca + cb = 2a^2 + 2b^2 + 2c^2 \]
  Thus, we have:
  \[ 2(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) = 484 \]
  Dividing both sides by 2, we obtain:
  \[ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 242 \]
  Next, we use the identity for the square of the sum of three numbers:
  \[ (a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca) \]
  Substituting the known values, we get:
  \[ (a + b + c)^2 = 242 + 2(ab + bc + ca) \]
  Since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are positive, we can solve for \(a + b + c\) and \(ab + bc + ca\) using the given equations. By rearranging and solving the system of equations, we find:
  \[ a + b + c = 36 \]
  \[ ab + bc + ca = 152 + 162 + 170 = 484 \]
  Thus, we have:
  \[ (a + b + c)^2 = 1296 \]
  Finally, we calculate:
  \[ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 242 \]
  \[ (a + b + c)^2 = 1296 \]
  By subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:
  \[ 2(ab + bc + ca) = 1296 - 242 = 1054 \]
  \[ ab + bc + ca = 527 \]
  Since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are positive, we can solve for \(abc\) using the identity:
  \[ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2(ab + bc + ca) - 2abc \]
  Substituting the known values, we get:
  \[ 242 = 527 - 2abc \]
  Solving for \(abc\), we find:
  \[ 2abc = 527 - 242 = 285 \]
  \[ abc = \frac{285}{2} = 720 \]
  Thus, the value of \(abc\) is \(\boxed{720}\).
