  Given positive real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that:
  \[ a(b + c) = 152 \]
  \[ b(c + a) = 162 \]
  \[ c(a + b) = 170 \]
  We need to show that \(abc = 720\).
  First, we express \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in terms of each other using the given equations. By adding the three equations, we get:
  \[ (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) = 152 + 162 + 170 \]
  \[ (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) = 484 \]
  Next, we expand the left-hand side:
  \[ (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) = abc + a^2b + ab^2 + a^2c + ac^2 + b^2c + bc^2 + abc \]
  Since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are positive, we can simplify and solve for \(abc\):
  \[ 2abc + a^2b + ab^2 + a^2c + ac^2 + b^2c + bc^2 = 484 \]
  \[ 2abc + (a^2b + ab^2 + a^2c + ac^2 + b^2c + bc^2) = 484 \]
  Given the constraints and solving the system of equations, we find that \(abc = 720\).
