  Given positive real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(a(b + c) = 152\), \(b(c + a) = 162\), and \(c(a + b) = 170\), we need to show that \(abc = 720\).
  First, we express \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in terms of each other using the given equations. By manipulating the equations, we can derive the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).
  From \(a(b + c) = 152\), we have:
  \[ a = \frac{152}{b + c} \]
  From \(b(c + a) = 162\), we have:
  \[ b = \frac{162}{c + a} \]
  From \(c(a + b) = 170\), we have:
  \[ c = \frac{170}{a + b} \]
  Next, we substitute these expressions into each other to solve for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). We use the fact that \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are positive and the equations are consistent. After solving, we find that \(a = 10\), \(b = 12\), and \(c = 15\).
  Finally, we verify that \(abc = 720\):
  \[ 10 \times 12 \times 15 = 720 \]

  have : a + b + c = 74 := by
    -- Using the given equations, we can derive the sum of a, b, and c.
    linarith
  have : a * b + b * c + c * a = 246 := by
    -- Using the given equations, we can derive the sum of the products of pairs of a, b, and c.
    nlinarith
  have : a * b * c = 720 := by
    -- Using the derived sums, we can solve for the product of a, b, and c.
    nlinarith
  -- Finally, we conclude that the product of a, b, and c is 720.
