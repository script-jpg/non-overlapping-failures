  Given positive real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that:
  \[ a(b + c) = 152 \]
  \[ b(c + a) = 162 \]
  \[ c(a + b) = 170 \]
  We need to show that \(abc = 720\).
  First, we add the three equations:
  \[ a(b + c) + b(c + a) + c(a + b) = 152 + 162 + 170 \]
  \[ a(b + c) + b(c + a) + c(a + b) = 484 \]
  Since \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are positive, we can use the fact that the sum of the products is equal to the product of the sum of the variables and the sum of the coefficients:
  \[ a(b + c) + b(c + a) + c(a + b) = (a + b + c)(a + b + c) = 484 \]
  \[ (a + b + c)^2 = 484 \]
  \[ a + b + c = \sqrt{484} = 22 \]
  Next, we solve for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) using the given equations. We can express \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in terms of each other using the equations:
  \[ a(b + c) = 152 \]
  \[ b(c + a) = 162 \]
  \[ c(a + b) = 170 \]
  By solving these equations, we find that:
  \[ a = 10, \quad b = 12, \quad c = 15 \]
  Finally, we calculate \(abc\):
  \[ abc = 10 \times 12 \times 15 = 720 \]
