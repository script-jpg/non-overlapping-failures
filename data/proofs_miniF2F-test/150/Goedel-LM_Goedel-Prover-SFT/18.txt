  Given positive real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(a(b+c) = 152\), \(b(c+a) = 162\), and \(c(a+b) = 170\), we need to show that \(abc = 720\).
  First, we express \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in terms of each other using the given equations. By manipulating these equations, we can derive a system that simplifies to a single equation in terms of \(abc\). Solving this equation yields the desired result.
