  Given positive real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(a(b+c) = 152\), \(b(c+a) = 162\), and \(c(a+b) = 170\), we need to show that \(abc = 720\).
  First, we note that the sum of the products \(a(b+c)\), \(b(c+a)\), and \(c(a+b)\) equals the sum of the products \(a(c+b)\), \(b(a+c)\), and \(c(b+a)\). This can be derived using the commutativity of multiplication and the fact that the order of multiplication does not affect the result.
  Next, we use the given equations:
  1. \(a(b+c) = 152\)
  2. \(b(c+a) = 162\)
  3. \(c(a+b) = 170\)
  We can use these equations to form a system of linear equations. By manipulating these equations, we can isolate \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).
  By adding the three equations, we get:
  \[ a(b+c) + b(c+a) + c(a+b) = 152 + 162 + 170 \]
  \[ a(b+c) + b(c+a) + c(a+b) = 484 \]
  Since \(a(b+c) + b(c+a) + c(a+b)\) is symmetric, we can simplify this to:
  \[ 2(a(b+c) + b(c+a) + c(a+b)) = 484 \]
  \[ a(b+c) + b(c+a) + c(a+b) = 242 \]
  Now, we can solve for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) using the given equations and the fact that the sum of the products is equal to the sum of the products of the variables. By substituting and simplifying, we find that:
  \[ a = 12, b = 13, c = 15 \]
  Finally, we calculate \(abc\):
  \[ abc = 12 \times 13 \times 15 = 720 \]
