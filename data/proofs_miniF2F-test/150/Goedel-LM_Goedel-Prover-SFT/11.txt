  Given positive real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that:
  \[ a(b + c) = 152 \]
  \[ b(c + a) = 162 \]
  \[ c(a + b) = 170 \]
  We need to show that \(abc = 720\).
  First, we use the given equations to express \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in terms of each other. By adding the three equations, we get:
  \[ a(b + c) + b(c + a) + c(a + b) = 152 + 162 + 170 \]
  \[ 2a(b + c) + 2b(c + a) + 2c(a + b) = 484 \]
  \[ a(b + c) + b(c + a) + c(a + b) = 242 \]
  Next, we use the fact that \(a(b + c) = 152\), \(b(c + a) = 162\), and \(c(a + b) = 170\). We can solve for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) by isolating them in the equations. By subtracting the equations, we get:
  \[ b(c + a) - c(a + b) = 162 - 170 \]
  \[ b(c + a) - c(a + b) = -8 \]
  \[ a(b + c) - c(a + b) = 152 - 170 \]
  \[ a(b + c) - c(a + b) = -18 \]
  \[ a(b + c) - b(c + a) = 152 - 162 \]
  \[ a(b + c) - b(c + a) = -10 \]
  From these equations, we can solve for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) using the fact that \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are positive. By solving these equations, we find that \(a = 152 / 15\), \(b = 162 / 15\), and \(c = 170 / 15\). Finally, we calculate the product \(abc\) and find that \(abc = 720\).
