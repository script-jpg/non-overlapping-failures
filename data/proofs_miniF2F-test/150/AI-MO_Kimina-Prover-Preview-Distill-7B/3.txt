-- The values $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive.
  obtain ⟨ha, hb, hc⟩ := h₀

  -- Multiplying the three equations gives
  -- $a^{2}b^{2}c^{2} = 152 \cdot 162 \cdot 170 = 4063200$
  have : a ^ 2 * b ^ 2 * c ^ 2 = 4063200 := by calc

    -- This uses arithmetic manipulations to simplify the expression.
    _ = a * (b + c) * (b * (c + a)) * (c * (a + b)) := by ring
    _ = 152 * 162 * 170 := by rw [h₁, h₂, h₃]
    _ = 4063200 := by norm_num

  -- The result follows by multiplying the two equations.
