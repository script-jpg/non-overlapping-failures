-- The 'p' means "puzzle", from AMC 12B in 2002.
  -- This is the 19th problem (p19) in the test.
  --(-- This problem comes in 2 parts. First, we have to prove that $a$, $b$, and $c$ are all positive. Then, we need to find the value of $abc$.)
  -- The problem has 5 answer choices, which are all concrete numbers. Therefore, in principle, we can just do a "Hypothesis Elimination" and check each one. However, it is more educational to derive the value of $abc$ directly.)

  -- Prove that $a$, $b$, and $c$ are all positive.
