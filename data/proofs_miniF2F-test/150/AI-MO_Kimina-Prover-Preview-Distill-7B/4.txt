-- We are given three equations: a(b+c) = 152, b(c+a) = 162, and c(a+b) = 170.
  -- Let's expand these equations:
  -- a(b+c) = ab + ac = 152
  -- b(c+a) = bc + ba = 162
  -- c(a+b) = ca + cb = 170
  have e₁ : a * b + a * c = 152 := by

  have e₂ : b * c + b * a = 162 := by

  have e₃ : c * a + c * b = 170 := by
    linarith

  -- We want to prove that abc = 720.
  suffices a * b * c = 720 by
    exact this

  -- We can add all three equations:
  -- ab + ac + bc + ba + ca + cb = 152 + 162 + 170
  have e₄ : 2 * (a * b + a * c + b * c) = 152 + 162 + 170 := by

  -- Thus, ab + ac + bc = (152 + 162 + 170) / 2 = 242
  have e₅ : a * b + a * c + b * c = 242 := by
    linarith

  -- We can now find abc by subtracting each original equation from this sum:
  -- abc = (ab + ac + bc) - (ab + ac) = 242 - 152 = 90
  have e₆ : b * c = 242 - 152 := by
    linarith

  -- abc = (ab + ac + bc) - (bc + ba) = 242 - 162 = 80
  have e₇ : a * c = 242 - 162 := by
    linarith

  -- abc = (ab + ac + bc) - (ca + cb) = 242 - 170 = 72
  have e₈ : a * b = 242 - 170 := by
    linarith

  -- Thus, a = 242 - 170 = 72, b = 242 - 152 = 90, c = 242 - 162 = 80
  have ha : a = 72 := by
    linarith

  have hb : b = 90 := by

  have hc : c = 80 := by
    linarith

  -- And abc = 72 * 90 * 80 = 720 * 80 = 57600

  -- But wait, we made a mistake. Let's recalculate:
  -- From e₆: bc = 242 - 152 = 90
  -- From e₇: ac = 242 - 162 = 80
  -- From e₈: ab = 242 - 170 = 72
  -- Thus, abc = sqrt(a²b²c²) = sqrt((ab)(ac)(bc)) = sqrt(72 * 80 * 90) = sqrt(518400) = 720
  have h : a * b * c = 720 := by
