-- From the three conditions, we can derive the following:
  have h₃ : ∀ x y, 0 < x ∧ 0 < y → y * f x (x + y) = (x + y) * f x y := by
    intro x y h
    specialize h₁ x y h
    rw [h₁] at h₂
    linarith

  -- The first condition tells us that $f(x,x)=x$.
  have h₄ : ∀ x, 0 < x → f x x = x := h₀

  -- The second condition tells us that $f(x,y)=f(y,x)$.
  have h₅ : ∀ x y, 0 < x ∧ 0 < y → f x y = f y x := h₁

  -- The third condition can be rearranged to the following form:
  have h₆ : ∀ x y, 0 < x ∧ 0 < y → f x (x + y) = (x + y) / y * f x y := by
    intro x y h
    specialize h₃ x y h
