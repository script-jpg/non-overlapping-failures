  To solve for \( f(14, 52) \) given the properties of the function \( f \):
  1. **Property 1**: \( f(x, x) = x \)
  2. **Property 2**: \( f(x, y) = f(y, x) \)
  3. **Property 3**: \( (x + y) f(x, y) = y f(x, x + y) \)
  We need to show that \( f(14, 52) = 364 \).
  First, we use property 1 to simplify the problem. Since \( f(x, x) = x \), we can directly substitute \( x = 14 \) and \( y = 52 \) into the function. However, this simplification does not directly yield the desired result. Instead, we use the properties of \( f \) to derive a system of equations that can be solved to find \( f(14, 52) \).
