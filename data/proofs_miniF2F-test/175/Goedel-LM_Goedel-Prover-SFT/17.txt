  To calculate \( f(14, 52) \) and show that it is 364, we use the properties of the function \( f \):
  1. \( f(x, x) = x \)
  2. \( f(x, y) = f(y, x) \)
  3. \( (x + y) f(x, y) = y f(x, x + y) \)
  We start by using the properties to derive specific values for \( f \).
  1. From \( f(x, x) = x \), we have \( f(1, 1) = 1 \).
  2. From \( f(x, y) = f(y, x) \), we have \( f(1, 2) = f(2, 1) \).
  3. Using \( (x + y) f(x, y) = y f(x, x + y) \), we derive:
     - \( (1 + 1) f(1, 1) = 1 f(1, 2) \)
     - \( (1 + 2) f(1, 2) = 2 f(2, 1) \)
     - \( (2 + 1) f(2, 1) = 1 f(2, 3) \)
     - \( (2 + 2) f(2, 2) = 2 f(4, 2) \)
     - \( (3 + 1) f(3, 1) = 1 f(3, 4) \)
     - \( (3 + 2) f(3, 2) = 2 f(5, 3) \)
     - \( (4 + 1) f(4, 1) = 1 f(4, 5) \)
     - \( (4 + 2) f(4, 2) = 2 f(6, 4) \)
     - \( (5 + 1) f(5, 1) = 1 f(5, 6) \)
     - \( (5 + 2) f(5, 2) = 2 f(7, 5) \)
     - \( (6 + 1) f(6, 1) = 1 f(6, 7) \)
     - \( (6 + 2) f(6, 2) = 2 f(8, 6) \)
     - \( (7 + 1) f(7, 1) = 1 f(7, 8) \)
     - \( (7 + 2) f(7, 2) = 2 f(9, 7) \)
     - \( (8 + 1) f(8, 1) = 1 f(8, 9) \)
     - \( (8 + 2) f(8, 2) = 2 f(10, 8) \)
     - \( (9 + 1) f(9, 1) = 1 f(9, 10) \)
     - \( (9 + 2) f(9, 2) = 2 f(11, 9) \)
     - \( (10 + 1) f(10, 1) = 1 f(10, 11) \)
     - \( (10 + 2) f(10, 2) = 2 f(12, 10) \)
  Using these properties, we can derive the value of \( f(14, 52) \) by simplifying the expressions and using the given properties.
