  To calculate \( f(14, 52) \) and show that it is 364, we use the properties of the function \( f \) as follows:
  1. \( f(x, x) = x \)
  2. \( f(x, y) = f(y, x) \)
  3. \( (x + y) f(x, y) = y f(x, x + y) \)
  Given these properties, we can derive the value of \( f(14, 52) \) by simplifying the expressions step by step.
