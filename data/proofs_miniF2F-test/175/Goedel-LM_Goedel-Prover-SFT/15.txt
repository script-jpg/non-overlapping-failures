  Given the function \( f \) defined on the set of ordered pairs of positive integers, we need to verify the following properties:
  1. \( f(x, x) = x \)
  2. \( f(x, y) = f(y, x) \)
  3. \( (x + y) f(x, y) = y f(x, x + y) \)
  We need to calculate \( f(14, 52) \) and show that it is 364.

  -- We use the properties of the function f to derive the value of f(14, 52).
  have h₃ := h₂ 14 52 (by norm_num) -- Apply the third property with x = 14 and y = 52.
  have h₄ := h₂ 52 14 (by norm_num) -- Apply the third property with x = 52 and y = 14.
  have h₅ := h₁ 14 52 (by norm_num) -- Apply the second property with x = 14 and y = 52.
  have h₆ := h₁ 52 14 (by norm_num) -- Apply the second property with x = 52 and y = 14.
  have h₇ := h₀ 14 (by norm_num) -- Apply the first property with x = 14.
  have h₈ := h₀ 52 (by norm_num) -- Apply the first property with x = 52.
  norm_num at h₃ h₄ h₅ h₆ h₇ h₈ -- Simplify the expressions to derive the value of f(14, 52).
  linarith -- Use linear arithmetic to conclude that f(14, 52) = 364.
