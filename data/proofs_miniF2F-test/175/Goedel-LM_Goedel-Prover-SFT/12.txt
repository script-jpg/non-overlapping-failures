  Given the function \( f \) defined on the set of ordered pairs of positive integers, we need to verify the following properties:
  1. \( f(x, x) = x \)
  2. \( f(x, y) = f(y, x) \)
  3. \( (x + y) f(x, y) = y f(x, x + y) \)
  We need to calculate \( f(14, 52) \) and show that it equals 364.

  -- Using the properties of f, we derive the following equations:

  have h₄ := h₂ 2 1
  have h₅ := h₂ 2 2
  have h₆ := h₂ 3 1
  have h₇ := h₂ 3 2
  have h₈ := h₂ 4 1
  have h₉ := h₂ 4 2
  have h₁₀ := h₂ 5 1
  have h₁₁ := h₂ 5 2
  have h₁₂ := h₂ 6 1
  have h₁₃ := h₂ 6 2
  have h₁₄ := h₂ 7 1
  have h₁₅ := h₂ 7 2
  have h₁₆ := h₂ 8 1
  have h₁₇ := h₂ 8 2
  have h₁₈ := h₂ 9 1
  have h₁₉ := h₂ 9 2
  have h₂₀ := h₂ 10 1
  have h₂₁ := h₂ 10 2
  have h₂₂ := h₂ 11 1
  have h₂₃ := h₂ 11 2
  have h₂₄ := h₂ 12 1
  have h₂₅ := h₂ 12 2
  have h₂₆ := h₂ 13 1
  have h₂₇ := h₂ 13 2
  have h₂₈ := h₂ 14 1
  have h₂₉ := h₂ 14 2
  -- Simplify the derived equations to find f(14, 52).
