  To solve the problem, we need to verify that the function \( f \) defined on the set of ordered pairs of positive integers satisfies the given properties and then calculate \( f(14, 52) \).
  1. **Properties Verification**:
     - \( f(x, x) = x \) for all positive integers \( x \).
     - \( f(x, y) = f(y, x) \) for all positive integers \( x \) and \( y \).
     - \( (x+y)f(x, y) = yf(x, x+y) \) for all positive integers \( x \) and \( y \).
  2. **Application of Properties**:
     - Using the properties, we can derive specific values for \( f \) by substituting specific values into the equations.
  3. **Calculation**:
     - We need to find \( f(14, 52) \).
     - By applying the properties, we can reduce the problem to simpler forms and compute the value directly.
