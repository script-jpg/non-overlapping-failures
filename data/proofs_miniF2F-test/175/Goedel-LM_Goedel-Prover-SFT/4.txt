  To solve the problem, we need to use the properties of the function \( f \) defined on the set of ordered pairs of positive integers. The properties are:
  1. \( f(x, x) = x \)
  2. \( f(x, y) = f(y, x) \)
  3. \( (x + y) f(x, y) = y f(x, x + y) \)
  We need to calculate \( f(14, 52) \) and show that it is 364.
