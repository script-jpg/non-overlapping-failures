  To calculate \( f(14, 52) \) and show that it is 364, we use the given properties of the function \( f \):
  1. \( f(x, x) = x \) for all \( x \).
  2. \( f(x, y) = f(y, x) \) for all \( x \) and \( y \).
  3. \( (x + y) f(x, y) = y f(x, x + y) \) for all \( x \) and \( y \).
  First, we use the property \( f(x, x) = x \) to simplify the problem. Then, we apply the other properties to derive the value of \( f(14, 52) \).
