  Given the function \( f \) defined on the set of ordered pairs of positive integers, we need to calculate \( f(14, 52) \) and show that it equals 364. The function satisfies the following properties:
  - \( f(x, x) = x \)
  - \( f(x, y) = f(y, x) \) for positive integers \( x \) and \( y \)
  - \( (x + y) f(x, y) = y f(x, x + y) \) for positive integers \( x \) and \( y \)
  To prove \( f(14, 52) = 364 \), we use the properties of the function and the given conditions.

  have h₃ := h₁ 14 52
  -- Using the property f(x, y) = f(y, x) for positive integers x and y, we get f(14, 52) = f(52, 14)
  have h₄ := h₁ 52 14
  -- Similarly, using the property f(x, y) = f(y, x), we get f(52, 14) = f(14, 52)
  have h₅ := h₂ 14 52
  -- Using the property (x + y) f(x, y) = y f(x, x + y), we get (14 + 52) f(14, 52) = 52 f(14, 52)
  have h₆ := h₂ 52 14
  -- Similarly, using the property (x + y) f(x, y) = y f(x, x + y), we get (52 + 14) f(52, 14) = 14 f(52, 14)
