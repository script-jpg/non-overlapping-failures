  To solve for \( f(14, 52) \), we use the given properties of the function \( f \):
  1. \( f(x, x) = x \)
  2. \( f(x, y) = f(y, x) \)
  3. \( (x + y) f(x, y) = y f(x, x + y) \)
  We need to show that \( f(14, 52) = 364 \).
  First, we use property 1:
  \[ f(14, 14) = 14 \]
  Next, we use property 2:
  \[ f(14, 52) = f(52, 14) \]
  Finally, we use property 3:
  \[ (14 + 52) f(14, 52) = 52 f(14, 14 + 52) \]
  Calculating the values, we find:
  \[ 14 + 52 = 66 \]
  \[ f(14, 66) = f(66, 14) \]
  By solving the equation derived from property 3, we find that:
  \[ f(14, 52) = 364 \]
