  To calculate \( f(14, 52) \) given the properties of the function \( f \):
  1. \( f(x, x) = x \)
  2. \( f(x, y) = f(y, x) \)
  3. \( (x + y) f(x, y) = y f(x, x + y) \)
  We need to show that \( f(14, 52) = 364 \).
  First, we use property 1 to simplify the expressions. Then, we apply property 2 to rearrange the terms. Finally, we use property 3 to solve for the desired value.

  have h₃ := h₀ 14 (by norm_num) -- Apply property 1 to get f(14, 14) = 14
  have h₄ := h₁ 14 52 (by norm_num) -- Apply property 2 to get f(14, 52) = f(52, 14)
  have h₅ := h₂ 14 52 (by norm_num) -- Apply property 3 to get (14 + 52) * f(14, 52) = 52 * f(14, 66)
  norm_num at h₃ h₄ h₅ -- Simplify the numerical expressions in h₃, h₄, and h₅
  linarith -- Use linear arithmetic to solve for f(14, 52)
