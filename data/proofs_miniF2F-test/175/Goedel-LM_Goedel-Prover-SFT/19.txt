  We need to show that the function \( f \) defined on the set of ordered pairs of positive integers satisfies the given properties and that \( f(14, 52) = 364 \). The properties are:
  1. \( f(x, x) = x \) for all \( x > 0 \).
  2. \( f(x, y) = f(y, x) \) for all \( x, y > 0 \).
  3. \( (x + y) f(x, y) = y f(x, x + y) \) for all \( x, y > 0 \).
  Given these properties, we will use the provided theorem and proof strategy to verify that \( f(14, 52) = 364 \).
