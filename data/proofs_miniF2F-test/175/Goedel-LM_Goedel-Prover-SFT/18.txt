 /-To solve for \( f(14, 52) \), we use the given properties of the function \( f \):

1. \( f(x, x) = x \)
2. \( f(x, y) = f(y, x) \)
3. \( (x + y)f(x, y) = yf(x, x + y) \)

Using these properties, we can derive the value of \( f(14, 52) \).

  -- Using property (i), we have f(14, 14) = 14.
  have h₃ := h₀ 14 (by norm_num)
  -- Using property (ii), we have f(14, 52) = f(52, 14).
  have h₄ := h₁ 14 52 (by norm_num)
  -- Using property (iii), we have (14 + 52) * f(14, 52) = 52 * f(14, 14 + 52).
  have h₅ := h₂ 14 52 (by norm_num)
  -- Simplify the equations to find f(14, 52).
  norm_num at h₃ h₄ h₅
  -- Use linear arithmetic to conclude that f(14, 52) = 364.
