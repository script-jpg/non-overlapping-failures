  To solve the problem, we need to verify that the function \( f \) defined on the set of ordered pairs of positive integers satisfies the given properties and then calculate \( f(14, 52) \).
  1. **Property Verification**:
     - \( f(x, x) = x \) for all \( x \)
     - \( f(x, y) = f(y, x) \) for all \( x, y \)
     - \( (x + y) f(x, y) = y f(x, x + y) \) for all \( x, y \)
  2. **Calculation**:
     - Using the properties, we need to compute \( f(14, 52) \).
     - We know that \( f(x, y) \) is symmetric and satisfies a specific relationship.
     - By applying the properties and simplifying, we can derive the value of \( f(14, 52) \).
