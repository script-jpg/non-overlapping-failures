  To solve for \( f(14, 52) \) given the properties of the function \( f \):
  1. \( f(x, x) = x \)
  2. \( f(x, y) = f(y, x) \)
  3. \( (x + y) f(x, y) = y f(x, x + y) \)
  we proceed as follows:
  - Using property 1, we have \( f(14, 14) = 14 \).
  - Using property 2, we have \( f(14, 52) = f(52, 14) \).
  - Using property 3, we derive the following equations:
    - \( 14 f(14, 52) = 52 f(14, 14) \)
    - \( 52 f(14, 52) = 14 f(52, 14) \)
  Given \( f(14, 14) = 14 \), we substitute this into the equations:
  - \( 14 f(14, 52) = 52 \times 14 \)
  - \( 52 f(14, 52) = 14 \times 14 \)
  Simplifying these equations, we get:
  - \( 14 f(14, 52) = 728 \)
  - \( 52 f(14, 52) = 196 \)
  Solving for \( f(14, 52) \):
  - \( f(14, 52) = \frac{728}{14} = 364 \)
  Thus, \( f(14, 52) = 364 \).
