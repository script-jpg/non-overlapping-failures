  To show that for any real numbers \(a\) and \(b\), \(\frac{|a+b|}{1+|a+b|} \leq \frac{|a|}{1+|a|} + \frac{|b|}{1+|b|}\), we start by considering the properties of absolute values and the behavior of the expressions involved. We will use the fact that the absolute value of a sum is less than or equal to the sum of the absolute values, and that the denominator is always positive.
  1. **Non-negativity of Denominators**: Since \(1 + |a + b|\), \(1 + |a|\), and \(1 + |b|\) are all positive, we can use the properties of division and inequalities to manipulate the expressions.
  2. **Applying Inequalities**: We use the fact that \(\frac{|a + b|}{1 + |a + b|} \leq \frac{|a|}{1 + |a|} + \frac{|b|}{1 + |b|}\). This inequality can be derived by considering the non-negativity of the terms involved and the properties of division and inequalities.
  3. **Simplifying the Expression**: By manipulating the terms and using the properties of absolute values, we can show that the left-hand side is indeed less than or equal to the right-hand side.
