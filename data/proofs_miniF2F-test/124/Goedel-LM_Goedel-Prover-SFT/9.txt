  To show that for any real numbers \(a\) and \(b\), \(\frac{|a+b|}{1+|a+b|} \leq \frac{|a|}{1+|a|} + \frac{|b|}{1+|b|}\), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Establish the non-negativity of the denominator**: Since \(1 + |a + b|\), \(1 + |a|\), and \(1 + |b|\) are all positive, their absolute values are non-negative.
  2. **Combine the fractions**: We need to show that \(\frac{|a+b|}{1+|a+b|} \leq \frac{|a|}{1+|a|} + \frac{|b|}{1+|b|}\). This can be achieved by manipulating the numerators and denominators to compare the two sides.
  3. **Use the properties of absolute values**: The absolute value function is non-negative and the inequality holds due to the properties of absolute values and the fact that the denominators are positive.
