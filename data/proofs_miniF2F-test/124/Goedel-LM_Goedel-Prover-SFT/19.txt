  To show that for any real numbers \(a\) and \(b\), \(\frac{|a+b|}{1+|a+b|} \leq \frac{|a|}{1+|a|} + \frac{|b|}{1+|b|}\), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Establish the non-negativity of the denominators**: Since \(a\) and \(b\) are real numbers, \(1 + |a + b|\), \(1 + |a|\), and \(1 + |b|\) are all positive.
  2. **Simplify the inequality**: Clear the denominators by multiplying both sides by \((1 + |a + b|) (1 + |a|) (1 + |b|)\).
  3. **Analyze the inequality**: Use the properties of absolute values and the fact that \(|a + b| \leq |a| + |b|\) to show that the left-hand side is less than or equal to the right-hand side.
