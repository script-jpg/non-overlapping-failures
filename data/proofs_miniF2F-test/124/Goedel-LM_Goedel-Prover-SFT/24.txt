  To show that for any real numbers \(a\) and \(b\), \(\frac{|a+b|}{1+|a+b|} \leq \frac{|a|}{1+|a|} + \frac{|b|}{1+|b|}\), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Establish non-negativity of the denominator**: Since \(|a + b| \geq 0\) and \(|a| \geq 0\), \(|b| \geq 0\), it follows that \(1 + |a + b| \geq 1\), \(1 + |a| \geq 1\), and \(1 + |b| \geq 1\).
  2. **Combine fractions**: Using the fact that \(1 + |a + b| \geq 1\), \(1 + |a| \geq 1\), and \(1 + |b| \geq 1\), we can combine the fractions \(\frac{|a + b|}{1 + |a + b|} \leq \frac{|a|}{1 + |a|} + \frac{|b|}{1 + |b|}\).
  3. **Simplify the inequality**: By the properties of absolute values and the fact that \(|a + b| \leq |a| + |b|\), we can simplify the inequality to \(\frac{|a + b|}{1 + |a + b|} \leq \frac{|a|}{1 + |a|} + \frac{|b|}{1 + |b|}\).
