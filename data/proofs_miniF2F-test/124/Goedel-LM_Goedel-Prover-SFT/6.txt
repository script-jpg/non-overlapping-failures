  To show that for any real numbers \(a\) and \(b\), \(\frac{|a+b|}{1+|a+b|} \leq \frac{|a|}{1+|a|} + \frac{|b|}{1+|b|}\), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Establish non-negativity of the denominator**: Since \(|a + b| \geq 0\), \(1 + |a + b| > 0\).
  2. **Simplify the fractions**: Clear the denominators by multiplying both sides by \(1 + |a + b|\), \(1 + |a|\), and \(1 + |b|\).
  3. **Combine and simplify**: Use algebraic manipulation to combine the terms and simplify the inequality.
  4. **Apply non-negative properties**: Use the fact that the absolute value of a non-negative number is non-negative to conclude the proof.
