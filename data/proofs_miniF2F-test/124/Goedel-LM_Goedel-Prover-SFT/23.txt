  To show that for any real numbers \(a\) and \(b\), \(\frac{|a+b|}{1+|a+b|} \leq \frac{|a|}{1+|a|} + \frac{|b|}{1+|b|}\), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Establish non-negativity of the denominator**: Since \(|a + b| \geq 0\), it follows that \(1 + |a + b| > 0\).
  2. **Establish non-negativity of the denominators**: Since \(|a| \geq 0\) and \(|b| \geq 0\), it follows that \(1 + |a| > 0\) and \(1 + |b| > 0\).
  3. **Simplify the fractions**: Clear the denominators by multiplying both sides of the inequality by \((1 + |a + b|)(1 + |a|)(1 + |b|)\).
  4. **Expand and simplify**: Expand the resulting inequality and simplify using properties of absolute values.
  5. **Apply non-negativity and inequalities**: Use the non-negativity of absolute values and basic inequalities to conclude the proof.
