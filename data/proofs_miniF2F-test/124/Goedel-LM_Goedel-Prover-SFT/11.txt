  To show that for any real numbers \(a\) and \(b\), \(\frac{|a+b|}{1+|a+b|} \leq \frac{|a|}{1+|a|} + \frac{|b|}{1+|b|}\), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Establish non-negativity of the denominators**: Since \(|a + b|\), \(|a|\), and \(|b|\) are all non-negative, it follows that \(1 + |a + b|\), \(1 + |a|\), and \(1 + |b|\) are positive.
  2. **Simplify the fractions**: Clear the denominators by multiplying both sides of the inequality by \((1 + |a + b|)(1 + |a|)(1 + |b|)\).
  3. **Expand and simplify**: Expand the resulting expressions and simplify using the properties of absolute values.
  4. **Apply algebraic inequalities**: Use the fact that the absolute value of a sum is less than or equal to the sum of the absolute values to establish the inequality.
