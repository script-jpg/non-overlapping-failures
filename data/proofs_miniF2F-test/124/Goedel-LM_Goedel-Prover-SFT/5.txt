  To show that for any real numbers \(a\) and \(b\), \(\frac{|a+b|}{1+|a+b|} \leq \frac{|a|}{1+|a|} + \frac{|b|}{1+|b|}\), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Establish non-negativity of the denominator**: Since \(1 + |a + b|\) is positive, we can use the division inequality.
  2. **Simplify the inequality**: Clear the denominators by multiplying both sides by \((1 + |a + b|)(1 + |a|)(1 + |b|)\).
  3. **Expand and simplify**: Use algebraic manipulation to expand and simplify the resulting expression.
  4. **Apply non-negativity and absolute value properties**: Use the fact that the absolute value of a non-negative number is non-negative and the absolute value of a non-positive number is non-positive.
  5. **Conclude the proof**: Use linear arithmetic to conclude the proof.
