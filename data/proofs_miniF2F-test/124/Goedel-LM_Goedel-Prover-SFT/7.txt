  To show that for any real numbers \(a\) and \(b\), \(\frac{|a+b|}{1+|a+b|} \leq \frac{|a|}{1+|a|} + \frac{|b|}{1+|b|}\), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Establish non-negativity of expressions**:
     - Since \(a\) and \(b\) are real numbers, \(|a + b|\), \(|a|\), and \(|b|\) are non-negative.
     - The sum \(|a + b| + |a| + |b|\) is also non-negative.
  2. **Apply the division inequality**:
     - We need to show that \(\frac{|a + b|}{1 + |a + b|} \leq \frac{|a|}{1 + |a|} + \frac{|b|}{1 + |b|}\).
     - This can be rewritten using the division inequality:
       \[
       \frac{|a + b|}{1 + |a + b|} \leq \frac{|a|}{1 + |a|} + \frac{|b|}{1 + |b|}
       \]
  3. **Use the fact that the denominator is positive**:
     - Since \(1 + |a + b|\), \(1 + |a|\), and \(1 + |b|\) are all positive, we can use the fact that the denominators are positive to compare the numerators directly.
  4. **Apply algebraic manipulation**:
     - By manipulating the expressions, we can show that the left-hand side is indeed less than or equal to the right-hand side.
  5. **Use the properties of absolute values**:
     - The properties of absolute values and the fact that \(|a + b|\), \(|a|\), and \(|b|\) are non-negative will help in the comparison.
