  To show that for any real numbers \(a\) and \(b\), \(\frac{|a+b|}{1+|a+b|} \leq \frac{|a|}{1+|a|} + \frac{|b|}{1+|b|}\), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Establish non-negativity of the denominator**: Since \(1 + |a + b|\) is positive, we have \(1 + |a + b| > 0\).
  2. **Establish non-negativity of the denominator**: Similarly, since \(1 + |a|\) is positive, we have \(1 + |a| > 0\).
  3. **Establish non-negativity of the denominator**: And since \(1 + |b|\) is positive, we have \(1 + |b| > 0\).
  4. **Simplify the inequality**: Using the properties of absolute values and the fact that the denominators are positive, we can simplify the inequality by clearing the denominators.
  5. **Apply algebraic manipulation**: Use algebraic manipulation and the properties of absolute values to show that the inequality holds.
