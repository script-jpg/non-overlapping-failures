  To show that for any real numbers \(a\) and \(b\), \(\frac{|a+b|}{1+|a+b|} \leq \frac{|a|}{1+|a|} + \frac{|b|}{1+|b|}\), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Establish non-negativity of the denominator**: Since \(|a + b|\) and \(|a|\) and \(|b|\) are non-negative, we have \(1 + |a + b| \geq 1\), \(1 + |a| \geq 1\), and \(1 + |b| \geq 1\).
  2. **Simplify the fractions**: Using the non-negativity of the denominators, we can rewrite the fractions as \(\frac{|a+b|}{1+|a+b|} \leq \frac{|a|}{1+|a|} + \frac{|b|}{1+|b|}\).
  3. **Apply the inequality**: By applying the inequality \(\frac{|a+b|}{1+|a+b|} \leq \frac{|a|}{1+|a|} + \frac{|b|}{1+|b|}\), we conclude the proof.
