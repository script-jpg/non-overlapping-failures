  To show that for any real numbers \(a\) and \(b\), \(\frac{|a+b|}{1+|a+b|} \leq \frac{|a|}{1+|a|} + \frac{|b|}{1+|b|}\), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Establish non-negativity of expressions**:
     - Since \(a\) and \(b\) are real numbers, \(a + b\) is also a real number. Therefore, \(|a + b|\) is non-negative.
     - Similarly, \(|a|\) and \(|b|\) are non-negative.
     - The sum \(|a| + |b|\) is also non-negative.
  2. **Simplify the inequality**:
     - We need to show that \(\frac{|a+b|}{1+|a+b|} \leq \frac{|a|}{1+|a|} + \frac{|b|}{1+|b|}\).
     - This can be achieved by manipulating the fractions using the properties of absolute values and the fact that the denominators are positive.
  3. **Apply algebraic manipulation**:
     - Using the fact that \(|a + b| \leq |a| + |b|\) (which follows from the triangle inequality), we can derive the desired inequality by considering the fractions and their sums.
