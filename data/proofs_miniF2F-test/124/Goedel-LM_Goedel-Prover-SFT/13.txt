theorem abs_add_div_one_add_abs_le (a b : ℝ) :
    abs (a + b) / (1 + abs (a + b)) ≤ abs a / (1 + abs a) + abs b / (1 + abs b) := by

  To show that for any real numbers \(a\) and \(b\), \(\frac{|a+b|}{1+|a+b|} \leq \frac{|a|}{1+|a|} + \frac{|b|}{1+|b|}\), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Establish the non-negativity of the denominators**: Since \(|a+b|\), \(|a|\), and \(|b|\) are all non-negative, we have \(1 + |a+b| > 0\), \(1 + |a| > 0\), and \(1 + |b| > 0\).
  2. **Simplify the fractions**: Using the fact that the denominators are positive, we can safely rewrite the fractions as \(\frac{|a+b|}{1+|a+b|} = \frac{|a+b|}{1+|a+b|}\) and \(\frac{|a|}{1+|a|} = \frac{|a|}{1+|a|}\).
  3. **Combine the fractions**: We need to show that \(\frac{|a+b|}{1+|a+b|} \leq \frac{|a|}{1+|a|} + \frac{|b|}{1+|b|}\). This can be achieved by manipulating the numerators and denominators using the properties of absolute values and algebraic manipulations.
  4. **Apply algebraic inequalities**: Use the fact that \(|a+b| \leq |a| + |b|\) and the properties of absolute values to derive the desired inequality.
