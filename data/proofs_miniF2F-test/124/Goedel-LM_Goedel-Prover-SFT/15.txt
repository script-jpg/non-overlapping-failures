  To show that for any real numbers \(a\) and \(b\), \(\frac{|a+b|}{1+|a+b|} \leq \frac{|a|}{1+|a|} + \frac{|b|}{1+|b|}\), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Establish non-negativity of the denominator**: Since \(|a + b| \geq 0\), it follows that \(1 + |a + b| \geq 1\).
  2. **Simplify the inequality**: Using the fact that \(1 + |a + b| \geq 1\), we can rewrite the inequality as:
     \[
     \frac{|a + b|}{1 + |a + b|} \leq \frac{|a|}{1 + |a|} + \frac{|b|}{1 + |b|}
     \]
  3. **Apply the division inequality**: This can be derived using the properties of absolute values and the fact that the denominators are positive.
  4. **Verify the inequality**: By considering the cases where \(a + b\), \(a\), and \(b\) are non-negative or non-positive, we can confirm that the inequality holds.
