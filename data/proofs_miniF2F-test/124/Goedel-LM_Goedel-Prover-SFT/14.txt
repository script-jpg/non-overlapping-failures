  To show that for any real numbers \(a\) and \(b\), \(\frac{|a+b|}{1+|a+b|} \leq \frac{|a|}{1+|a|} + \frac{|b|}{1+|b|}\), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Establish non-negativity of the denominator**: Since \(|a + b| \geq 0\), it follows that \(1 + |a + b| \geq 1\).
  2. **Combine fractions**: Using the non-negativity of the denominator, we can combine the fractions \(\frac{|a|}{1+|a|}\) and \(\frac{|b|}{1+|b|}\).
  3. **Simplify the expression**: By simplifying the combined fraction, we show that it is less than or equal to \(\frac{|a+b|}{1+|a+b|}\).
