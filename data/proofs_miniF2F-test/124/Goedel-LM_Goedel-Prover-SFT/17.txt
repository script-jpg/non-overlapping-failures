  To show that for any real numbers \(a\) and \(b\), \(\frac{|a+b|}{1+|a+b|} \leq \frac{|a|}{1+|a|} + \frac{|b|}{1+|b|}\), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Establish the non-negativity of the denominator**: Since \(|a + b| \geq 0\) and \(|a| \geq 0\), we have \(1 + |a + b| \geq 1\) and \(1 + |a| \geq 1\).
  2. **Simplify the inequality**: Clear the denominators by multiplying both sides by \((1 + |a + b|)(1 + |a|)(1 + |b|)\).
  3. **Analyze the inequality**: Use the properties of absolute values and the fact that \(|a + b| \leq |a| + |b|\) to show that the inequality holds.
