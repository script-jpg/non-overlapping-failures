  To show that for any real numbers \(a\) and \(b\), \(\frac{|a+b|}{1+|a+b|} \leq \frac{|a|}{1+|a|} + \frac{|b|}{1+|b|}\), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Establish non-negativity of the denominator**: Since \(|a + b|\) and \(|a|\) and \(|b|\) are non-negative, we have \(1 + |a + b| > 0\), \(1 + |a| > 0\), and \(1 + |b| > 0\).
  2. **Simplify the inequality**: Clear the denominators by multiplying both sides by \((1 + |a + b|)(1 + |a|)(1 + |b|)\).
  3. **Expand and simplify**: Expand the resulting expression and simplify using properties of absolute values.
  4. **Apply the inequality**: Use the fact that the numerator of the left-hand side is less than or equal to the numerator of the right-hand side, given the non-negativity of the terms involved.
