-- Let $a$ and $b$ be real numbers.
  -- We need to show that $\frac{|a+b|}{1+|a+b|} \leq \frac{|a|}{1+|a|} + \frac{|b|}{1+|b|}$.

  -- We need the following lemma.
  have lem_1 : ∀ x y : ℝ, |x + y| ≤ |x| + |y| := by
    intro x y
    exact abs_add x y

  have lem_1' : ∀ x y : ℝ, |x + y| / (1 + |x + y|) ≤ (|x| + |y|) / (1 + |x + |y|) := by

  -- We also need the following lemma.
