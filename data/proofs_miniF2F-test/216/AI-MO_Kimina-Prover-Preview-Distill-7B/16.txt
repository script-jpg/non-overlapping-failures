-- First, let's understand what we're given:
  -- We have a 3x3 matrix with specific properties:
  -- (a) The diagonal elements a11, a22, a33 are positive
  -- (b) The off-diagonal elements are negative
  -- (c) The sum of each row is positive
  -- We need to prove that the only solution to the homogeneous system is x = y = z = 0

  -- Step 1: Analyze the structure of the system
  have eq1 : a 0 * x + a 1 * y + a 2 * z = 0 := h₇
  have eq2 : a 3 * x + a 4 * y + a 5 * z = 0 := h₈
  have eq3 : a 6 * x + a 7 * y + a 8 * z = 0 := h₉

  -- Step 2: Use the constraints to derive properties of the solution
  -- Let's think about how we can prove x = y = z = 0
  -- One approach is to show that x, y, z must be non-positive and non-negative, hence zero

  -- Step 3: Prove that x, y, z are non-negative
  -- Consider the first equation: a0 * x + a1 * y + a2 * z = 0
  -- Since a0 > 0, a1 < 0, a2 < 0, and the sum is zero,
  -- if x ≤ 0, then a0 * x ≤ 0, and a1 * y + a2 * z ≥ 0 (since y,z ≥ 0 would make negative terms cancel out)
  -- This suggests x must be non-negative
