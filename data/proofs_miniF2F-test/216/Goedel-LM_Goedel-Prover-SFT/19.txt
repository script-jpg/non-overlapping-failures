  To prove that the system of linear equations has only the solution \( x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = 0 \), we start by analyzing the given conditions. The coefficients satisfy:
  1. \( a_{11}, a_{22}, a_{33} \) are positive.
  2. The remaining coefficients are negative.
  3. In each equation, the sum of the coefficients is positive.
  Given the equations:
  \[ a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + a_{13}x_3 = 0 \]
  \[ a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + a_{23}x_3 = 0 \]
  \[ a_{31}x_1 + a_{32}x_2 + a_{33}x_3 = 0 \]
  We need to show that \( x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = 0 \).
