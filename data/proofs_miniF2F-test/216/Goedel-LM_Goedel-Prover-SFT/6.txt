  Given the system of equations:
  \[ a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + a_{13}x_3 = 0 \]
  \[ a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + a_{23}x_3 = 0 \]
  \[ a_{31}x_1 + a_{32}x_2 + a_{33}x_3 = 0 \]
  with unknowns \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \), where the coefficients satisfy:
  - \( a_{11}, a_{22}, a_{33} \) are positive numbers,
  - the remaining coefficients are negative numbers,
  - in each equation, the sum of the coefficients is positive.
  We need to prove that the given system has only the solution \( x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = 0 \).

  -- For each variable, we use the fact that the sum of coefficients in each equation is positive to show that the only solution is x = 0, y = 0, z = 0.

    -- Using the given inequalities and the fact that the sum of coefficients in each equation is positive, we derive a contradiction if x, y, or z are not zero.
