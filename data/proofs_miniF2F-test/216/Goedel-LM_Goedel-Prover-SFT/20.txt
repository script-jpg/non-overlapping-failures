Let $x_1, x_2, x_3$ be the unknowns. Using the given conditions, we can represent the system as:

$a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + a_{13}x_3 = 0$
$a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + a_{23}x_3 = 0$
$a_{31}x_1 + a_{32}x_2 + a_{33}x_3 = 0$

with coefficients satisfying conditions (a), (b), and (c). We need to prove that the only solution is $x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = 0$.

Suppose for contradiction that there exist non-zero numbers $x_1, x_2, x_3$ satisfying the system. We will derive a contradiction using the given conditions.

(a) Since $a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + a_{13}x_3 = 0$, and by condition (a) $a_{11} > 0$, it follows that $x_1 = 0$.

(b) Similarly, by condition (b) $a_{22} < 0$ and $a_{21} < 0$, and since $a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + a_{23}x_3 = 0$, it follows that $x_2 = 0$.

(c) Finally, by condition (c) $a_{33} > 0$ and $a_{32} > 0$, and since $a_{32}x_2 + a_{33}x_3 = 0$, it follows that $x_3 = 0$.

Thus, the only solution to the system is $x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = 0$.

  Given the system of equations:
  \[ a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + a_{13}x_3 = 0 \]
  \[ a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + a_{23}x_3 = 0 \]
  \[ a_{31}x_1 + a_{32}x_2 + a_{33}x_3 = 0 \]
  with coefficients satisfying conditions (a), (b), and (c), we need to prove that the only solution is \( x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = 0 \).
  Suppose for contradiction that there exist non-zero numbers \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \) satisfying the system. We will derive a contradiction using the given conditions.
  (a) Since \( a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + a_{13}x_3 = 0 \), and by condition (a) \( a_{11} > 0 \), it follows that \( x_1 = 0 \).
  (b) Similarly, by condition (b) \( a_{22} < 0 \) and \( a_{21} < 0 \), and since \( a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + a_{23}x_3 = 0 \), it follows that \( x_2 = 0 \).
  (c) Finally, by condition (c) \( a_{33} > 0 \) and \( a_{32} > 0 \), and since \( a_{32}x_2 + a_{33}x_3 = 0 \), it follows that \( x_3 = 0 \).
  Thus, the only solution to the system is \( x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = 0 \).
