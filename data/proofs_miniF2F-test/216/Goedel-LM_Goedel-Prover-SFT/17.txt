  Given the system of equations:
  \[ a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + a_{13}x_3 = 0 \]
  \[ a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + a_{23}x_3 = 0 \]
  \[ a_{31}x_1 + a_{32}x_2 + a_{33}x_3 = 0 \]
  with unknowns \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \). The coefficients satisfy the conditions:
  (a) \( a_{11}, a_{22}, a_{33} \) are positive numbers;
  (b) the remaining coefficients are negative numbers;
  (c) in each equation, the sum of the coefficients is positive.
  We need to prove that the given system has only the solution \( x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = 0 \).

  -- Using the inequalities and the fact that the sum of coefficients in each equation is positive,
  -- we can deduce that each x must be zero to satisfy the equations.
