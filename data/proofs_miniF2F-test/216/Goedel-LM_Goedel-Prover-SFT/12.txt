  To prove that the given system has only the solution \( x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = 0 \), we start by analyzing the conditions and the equations provided. We know that the coefficients \( a_{11}, a_{22}, a_{33} \) are positive, and the remaining coefficients are negative. Additionally, the sum of the coefficients in each equation is positive.
  Given the system of equations:
  \[ a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + a_{13}x_3 = 0 \]
  \[ a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + a_{23}x_3 = 0 \]
  \[ a_{31}x_1 + a_{32}x_2 + a_{33}x_3 = 0 \]
  We need to show that the only solution to this system is \( x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = 0 \).
