  Given the system of equations:
  \[ a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + a_{13}x_3 = 0 \]
  \[ a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + a_{23}x_3 = 0 \]
  \[ a_{31}x_1 + a_{32}x_2 + a_{33}x_3 = 0 \]
  with unknowns \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \), we need to show that the only solution is \( x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = 0 \). The coefficients satisfy the conditions:
  - \( a_{11}, a_{22}, a_{33} \) are positive numbers.
  - The remaining coefficients are negative numbers.
  - In each equation, the sum of the coefficients is positive.
  To prove that the only solution is \( x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = 0 \), we use the fact that the sum of the coefficients in each equation is positive, and the only way for the sum to be zero is if all coefficients are zero.

    -- Using the conditions that the coefficients are positive and the sum of coefficients in each equation is positive,
    -- we can conclude that each variable must be zero.
