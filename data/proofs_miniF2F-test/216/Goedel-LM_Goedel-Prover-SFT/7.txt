Implication of the system of equations having only the trivial solution

Given the system of equations:
$$a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + a_{13}x_3 = 0$$
$$a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + a_{23}x_3 = 0$$
$$a_{31}x_1 + a_{32}x_2 + a_{33}x_3 = 0$$
with the conditions:

(a) $a_{11}$, $a_{22}$, $a_{33}$ are positive numbers;

(b) the remaining coefficients are negative numbers;

(c) in each equation, the sum of the coefficients is positive.

Prove that the given system has only the solution $x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = 0$.

  Given the system of equations:
  \[ a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + a_{13}x_3 = 0 \]
  \[ a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + a_{23}x_3 = 0 \]
  \[ a_{31}x_1 + a_{32}x_2 + a_{33}x_3 = 0 \]
  with the conditions:
  (a) \( a_{11} \), \( a_{22} \), \( a_{33} \) are positive numbers;
  (b) the remaining coefficients are negative numbers;
  (c) in each equation, the sum of the coefficients is positive.
  We need to prove that the given system has only the solution \( x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = 0 \).
