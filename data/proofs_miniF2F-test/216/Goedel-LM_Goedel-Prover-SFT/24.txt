  Given the system of equations:
  \[ a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + a_{13}x_3 = 0 \]
  \[ a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + a_{23}x_3 = 0 \]
  \[ a_{31}x_1 + a_{32}x_2 + a_{33}x_3 = 0 \]
  with unknowns \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \), and the coefficients satisfy:
  - \( a_{11}, a_{22}, a_{33} \) are positive numbers.
  - The remaining coefficients are negative numbers.
  - In each equation, the sum of the coefficients is positive.
  We need to prove that the only solution is \( x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = 0 \).
