If the system has a solution, then by Vieta's formulas, $a_0 x^3 + a_1 x^2 + a_2 x + a_3 = 0$ has a positive root. Consequently, the polynomial $a_0 x^3 + a_1 x^2 + a_2 x + a_3$ has a positive root. Since $a_0$ is positive, the leading coefficient of the polynomial is positive, and all other coefficients are negative. Therefore, $x = 0$ is the only positive root. Consequently, the system has only the solution $x = 0$, $y = 0$, $z = 0$.

If $x = 0$, $y = 0$, $z = 0$, the system of equations becomes:
$a_1 y + a_2 z = 0$
$a_4 y + a_5 z = 0$
$a_6 y + a_7 z = 0$
which is obviously satisfied.

If $a_1 = 0$, then $a_2 = -a_1 x$, $a_4 = -a_3 x$, $a_6 = -a_5 x$ and the system becomes:
$a_2 y + a_3 z = 0$
$a_5 y + a_6 z = 0$
which is also obviously satisfied if $y = 0$, $z = 0$.

Therefore, the only solution of the original system is $x = 0$, $y = 0$, $z = 0$.-/

  Given the system of equations:
  \[ a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + a_{13}x_3 = 0 \]
  \[ a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + a_{23}x_3 = 0 \]
  \[ a_{31}x_1 + a_{32}x_2 + a_{33}x_3 = 0 \]
  with unknowns \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \). The coefficients satisfy the conditions:
  - \( a_{11}, a_{22}, a_{33} \) are positive numbers.
  - \( a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6, a_7, a_8 \) are negative numbers.
  - \( a_0 + a_1 + a_2 > 0 \), \( a_3 + a_4 + a_5 > 0 \), \( a_6 + a_7 + a_8 > 0 \).
  To prove that the only solution to the system is \( x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = 0 \), we can use the fact that the system is linear and the coefficients are non-zero. By substituting \( x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = 0 \) into the equations, we can verify that they hold true, confirming that \( x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = 0 \) is the only solution.
