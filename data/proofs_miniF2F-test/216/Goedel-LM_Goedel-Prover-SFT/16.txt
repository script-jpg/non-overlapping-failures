  Given the system of equations:
  \[ a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + a_{13}x_3 = 0 \]
  \[ a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + a_{23}x_3 = 0 \]
  \[ a_{31}x_1 + a_{32}x_2 + a_{33}x_3 = 0 \]
  with unknowns \( x_1, x_2, x_3 \). The coefficients satisfy the following conditions:
  1. \( a_{11}, a_{22}, a_{33} \) are positive numbers.
  2. The remaining coefficients are negative numbers.
  3. In each equation, the sum of the coefficients is positive.
  We need to prove that the given system has only the solution \( x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = 0 \).
  To prove this, we will show that the only solution that satisfies the system of equations and the given conditions is the trivial solution \( x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = 0 \).
