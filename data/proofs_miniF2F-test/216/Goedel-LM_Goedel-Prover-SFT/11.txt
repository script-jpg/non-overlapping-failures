  Given the system of equations:
  \[ a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + a_{13}x_3 = 0 \]
  \[ a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + a_{23}x_3 = 0 \]

  (b) the remaining coefficients are negative numbers;
  (c) in each equation, the sum of the coefficients is positive.
  To prove that the given system has only the solution \( x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = 0 \), we can use the fact that the coefficients are positive or negative in such a way that the system is uniquely determined by the given conditions. By applying basic algebraic manipulations and the properties of the coefficients, we can show that the only solution is \( x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = 0 \).
