  To prove that the system of equations
  \[ a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + a_{13}x_3 = 0 \]
  \[ a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + a_{23}x_3 = 0 \]
  \[ a_{31}x_1 + a_{32}x_2 + a_{33}x_3 = 0 \]
  has only the solution \( x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = 0 \), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Construct the proof for \( x = 0 \)**:
     - Assume \( x \neq 0 \) and derive a contradiction.
     - Use the fact that the sum of the coefficients in each equation is positive to show that the only solution is \( x = 0 \).
  2. **Construct the proof for \( y = 0 \)**:
     - Assume \( y \neq 0 \) and derive a contradiction.
     - Use the fact that the sum of the coefficients in each equation is positive to show that the only solution is \( y = 0 \).
  3. **Construct the proof for \( z = 0 \)**:
     - Assume \( z \neq 0 \) and derive a contradiction.
     - Use the fact that the sum of the coefficients in each equation is positive to show that the only solution is \( z = 0 \).
