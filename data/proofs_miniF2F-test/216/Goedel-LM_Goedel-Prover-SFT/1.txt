We need to prove that the system of linear equations:

\(a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + a_{13}x_3 = 0\)
\(a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + a_{23}x_3 = 0\)
\(a_{31}x_1 + a_{32}x_2 + a_{33}x_3 = 0\)

has only the solution \(x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = 0\).

Given the conditions on the coefficients \(a_{ij}\):

(a) \(a_{11}\), \(a_{22}\), \(a_{33}\) are positive numbers.
(b) The remaining coefficients are negative numbers.
(c) In each equation, the sum of the coefficients is positive.

We will use these conditions to show that the only solution to the system is \(x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = 0\).
