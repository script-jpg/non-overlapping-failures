In this solution, we first ensure that $x + 1 \neq 0$ to avoid division by zero. This is done by contradiction: if $x + 1 = 0$, then $x = -1$, which contradicts our assumption.

Next, we use `field_simp` to transform the fractional equation into a polynomial equation. The `field_simp` tactic simplifies expressions involving field operations, handling the cases where denominators are non-zero.

After simplification, we have $x - 9 = 2(x + 1)$. Expanding the right side gives $x - 9 = 2x + 2$. 

Rearranging terms to isolate $x$, we subtract $x$ from both sides: $-9 - 2 = 2x - x$, which simplifies to $-11 = x$.

The `linarith` tactic is powerful enough to solve this linear equation directly from the simplified form provided by `field_simp`. It performs the algebraic manipulations automatically: 
1. From $x - 9 = 2(x + 1)$
2. To $x - 9 = 2x + 2$
3. To $-9 - 2 = 2x - x$
4. To $-11 = x$

Therefore, the solution to the equation is $x = -11$.
