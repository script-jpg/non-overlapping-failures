In this Lean 4 proof, we're solving the equation (x - 9) / (x + 1) = 2 for x. The key steps are:
1. We first ensure that x + 1 ≠ 0 to avoid division by zero. This would mean x ≠ -1.
2. We use `field_simp` tactic to transform the equation (x - 9) / (x + 1) = 2 into x - 9 = 2 * (x + 1), assuming x + 1 ≠ 0.
3. After simplification, we have x - 9 = 2 * x + 2.
4. Rearranging terms: x - 2 * x = 9 + 2
5. -x = 11
6. x = -11

The Lean proof automatically handles these algebraic manipulations using the `linarith` tactic after the equation has been simplified with `field_simp`. The `linarith` tactic is powerful enough to solve linear arithmetic goals, deriving that x = -11 from the simplified equation.

Therefore, the solution to the equation (x - 9) / (x + 1) = 2 is x = -11, as shown in the Lean 4 proof.
