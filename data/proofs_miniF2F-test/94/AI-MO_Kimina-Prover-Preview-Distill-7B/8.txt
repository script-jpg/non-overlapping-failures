-- Multiply both sides by $x+1$ which is valid since $x+1 \ne 0$ as $x \ne -1$.
  apply congr_arg (fun y => y * (x + 1)) at h₁
  -- Now the equation reads $(x-9) = 2(x+1)$
  -- which simplifies to $x-9 = 2x+2$.
  rw [div_mul_cancel₀ _ h₀] at h₁

  -- Move all terms involving $x$ to the left and constants to the right.
  apply congr_arg (fun y => y - x - 2) at h₁
  ring_nf at h₁

  -- This simplifies to $-11 = x$.
