This Lean 4 proof solves the equation \(\frac{x-9}{x+1}=2\) for \(x\), showing that the solution is \(x = -11\).

First, the proof sets up the theorem statement with the given equation and the condition that \(x \neq -1\) (to ensure the denominator is not zero):

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

The import statements bring in the necessary libraries for mathematical reasoning, and the `set_option` line allows Lean to work with larger proofs by disabling the heartbeats mechanism that would otherwise terminate the proof if it took too long.

Now, let's look at the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_80 (x : ℝ) (h₀ : x ≠ -1) (h₁ : (x - 9) / (x + 1) = 2) : x = -11 := by
```

The theorem declares that for a real number \(x\), if \(x \neq -1\) and \(\frac{x-9}{x+1} = 2\), then \(x = -11\).

Next, the proof needs to establish that \(x + 1 \neq 0\) to safely manipulate the equation:

```tactics
have : x + 1 ≠ 0 := by intro h; apply h₀; linarith
```

This proof segment establishes that \(x + 1 \neq 0\) by contradiction. If \(x + 1 = 0\), then \(x = -1\), which contradicts our assumption \(h₀\). The `linarith` tactic handles the linear arithmetic to make this contradiction explicit.

Now, with the safety of the denominator established, the proof can use `field_simp` to handle the fraction:

```tactics
field_simp at h₁
```

The `field_simp` tactic simplifies expressions involving field operations, handling the division in our equation. After this step, the equation should be simplified to something like \(x - 9 = 2 \cdot (x + 1)\), but the exact form may vary depending on Lean's internal representation.

Finally, the proof uses linear arithmetic to solve for \(x\):

```tactics
linarith
```

The `linarith` tactic solves linear arithmetic problems. It should be able to deduce that the only value of \(x\) satisfying the equation is \(x = -11\).

To solve this manually: 
Multiply both sides by \(x + 1\) to get \(x - 9 = 2(x + 1)\)
Expanding: \(x - 9 = 2x + 2\)
Rearranging: \(x - 2x = 2 + 9\)
Simplifying: \(-x = 11\)
Therefore: \(x = -11\)

The Lean proof is remarkably concise because Lean's automation is powerful for these types of algebraic manipulations. The proof establishes the necessary condition \(x + 1 \neq 0\), simplifies the equation, and then solves the resulting linear equation, all in a few simple steps.
