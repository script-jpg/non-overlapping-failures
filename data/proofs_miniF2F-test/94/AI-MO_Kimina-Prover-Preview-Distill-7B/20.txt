The key insight in this problem is to recognize that we can clear the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by $(x + 1)$, which is valid since we know $x + 1 \neq 0$ (guaranteed by the hypothesis h₀: $x \neq -1$).

1. Start with the equation: $\frac{x-9}{x+1} = 2$.
2. Multiply both sides by $(x + 1)$ to eliminate the denominator: $(x - 9) = 2(x + 1)$.
3. Expand the right side: $x - 9 = 2x + 2$.
4. Rearrange the equation to isolate $x$: $x - 9 = 2x + 2 \Rightarrow -9 - 2 = 2x - x \Rightarrow -11 = x$.

So the unique solution to the equation is $x = -11$.

The Lean proof follows these steps perfectly:
- It first establishes that $x + 1 \neq 0$ using the given hypothesis h₀: $x \neq -1$.
- Then it uses `field_simp` to multiply both sides by $(x + 1)$, which clears the denominator and gives us the equation $(x - 9) = 2(x + 1)$.
- Finally, it uses `linarith` to solve the resulting linear equation, deriving $x = -11$.

The Lean proof is remarkably concise because Lean's automation can handle the algebraic manipulations that we would do by hand. The proof follows exactly the same logical steps a person would take to solve the equation algebraically, but Lean's powerful automation performs these steps internally.
