  To solve the equation \(\frac{x-9}{x+1} = 2\) for \(x\), we start by ensuring that \(x \neq -1\) to avoid division by zero. We then simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by \(x+1\) to eliminate the fraction. This results in \(x - 9 = 2(x + 1)\). Expanding and simplifying both sides, we get \(x - 9 = 2x + 2\). By isolating \(x\), we find that \(x = -11\).
