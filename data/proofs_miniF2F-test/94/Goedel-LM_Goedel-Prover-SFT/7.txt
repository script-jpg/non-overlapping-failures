  To solve the equation \(\frac{x-9}{x+1} = 2\) for \(x\), we start by ensuring that the denominator is not zero, i.e., \(x \neq -1\). We then clear the fraction by multiplying both sides by \(x+1\), resulting in \(x-9 = 2(x+1)\). Expanding and simplifying this equation, we get \(x-9 = 2x + 2\). Rearranging terms to isolate \(x\), we obtain \(x-2x = 2 + 9\), which simplifies to \(-x = 11\). Finally, solving for \(x\), we find \(x = -11\).
