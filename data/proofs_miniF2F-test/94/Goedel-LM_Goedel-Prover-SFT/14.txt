  To solve the equation \(\frac{x-9}{x+1} = 2\) for \(x\), we start by ensuring that \(x \neq -1\) to avoid division by zero. We then rewrite the equation to eliminate the fraction. Multiplying both sides by \(x+1\) gives \(x-9 = 2(x+1)\). Expanding and simplifying this equation results in \(x-9 = 2x + 2\). Rearranging terms to isolate \(x\) yields \(x-2x = 2 + 9\), which simplifies to \(-x = 11\). Thus, \(x = -11\).
