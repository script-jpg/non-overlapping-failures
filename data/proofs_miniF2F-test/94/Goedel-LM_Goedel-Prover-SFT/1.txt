  To solve the equation \(\frac{x-9}{x+1} = 2\) for \(x\), we start by ensuring that the denominator is not zero, which is given by \(x \neq -1\). We then clear the fraction by multiplying both sides by \(x+1\). This yields the equation \(x - 9 = 2(x + 1)\). Expanding and simplifying this equation, we get \(x - 9 = 2x + 2\). By isolating \(x\), we find that \(x = -11\).
