  To solve the equation \(\frac{x-9}{x+1} = 2\) for \(x\), we start by ensuring that \(x \neq -1\) to avoid division by zero. Multiplying both sides of the equation by \(x + 1\) to eliminate the fraction, we get:
  \[ x - 9 = 2(x + 1) \]
  Expanding the right-hand side, we have:
  \[ x - 9 = 2x + 2 \]
  Next, we isolate \(x\) by moving all terms involving \(x\) to one side and constant terms to the other side:
  \[ x - 2x = 2 + 9 \]
  Simplifying this, we find:
  \[ -x = 11 \]
  Finally, solving for \(x\), we multiply both sides by -1:
  \[ x = -11 \]
