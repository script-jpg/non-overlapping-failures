  To solve the equation \(\frac{x-9}{x+1} = 2\) for \(x\), we start by ensuring that \(x \neq -1\) to avoid division by zero. We then rewrite the equation to eliminate the fraction, resulting in \(x - 9 = 2(x + 1)\). Expanding and simplifying this equation, we get \(x - 9 = 2x + 2\). By isolating \(x\), we find \(x = -11\).
