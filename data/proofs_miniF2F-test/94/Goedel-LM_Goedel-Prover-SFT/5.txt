  To solve the equation \(\frac{x-9}{x+1} = 2\) for \(x\), we start by ensuring that \(x \neq -1\) to avoid division by zero. We then multiply both sides by \(x+1\) to eliminate the fraction, resulting in \(x-9 = 2(x+1)\). Expanding and simplifying this equation, we get \(x-9 = 2x + 2\). By isolating \(x\), we find \(x = -11\).
