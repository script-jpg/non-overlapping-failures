  To solve the equation \(\frac{x-9}{x+1} = 2\) for \(x\), we start by ensuring that the denominator is not zero. Given \(x \neq -1\), we proceed to eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by \(x+1\). This yields the equation \(x-9 = 2(x+1)\). Expanding and simplifying this equation, we get \(x-9 = 2x + 2\). By isolating \(x\), we find that \(x = -11\).
