  To solve the problem of finding the sum of the final three digits of the integer representation of \(5^{100}\), we need to compute \(5^{100} \mod 1000\) and then extract the digits from the result. The key steps involve simplifying the expression \(5^{100} \mod 1000\) and then summing the digits.
