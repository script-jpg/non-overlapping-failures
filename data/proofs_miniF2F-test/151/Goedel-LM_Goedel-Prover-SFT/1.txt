  To solve the problem of finding the sum of the final three digits of the integer representation of \(5^{100}\), we need to compute \(5^{100} \mod 1000\) and then determine the digits of the result. The key insight is that the digits of \(5^{100} \mod 1000\) will be different from the digits of \(5^{99}\) because the last digit of \(5^{100}\) is 5, and thus the last digit of \(5^{99}\) is 5.
  Given the constraints \(a \leq 9\), \(b \leq 9\), and \(c \leq 9\), we can use the provided information to find the sum \(a + b + c\).
