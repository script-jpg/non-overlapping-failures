  To determine the sum of the final three digits of the integer representation of \(5^{100}\), we need to compute \(5^{100} \mod 1000\). The problem states that the digits of \(5^{100} \mod 1000\) are \(c, b, a\) where \(a \leq 9\), \(b \leq 9\), and \(c \leq 9\). We are also given that \(a, b, c\) are the digits of \(5^{100} \mod 1000\) and that their sum is 13.

  -- We know that 5^100 modulo 1000 is a number whose digits are c, b, a.
  have : 5 ^ 100 % 1000 = 125 := by norm_num
  -- Rewrite the given conditions using the known value of 5^100 modulo 1000.
