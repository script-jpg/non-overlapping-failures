  To solve the problem of finding the sum of the final three digits of \(5^{100}\), we need to follow these steps:
  1. Calculate \(5^{100} \mod 1000\).
  2. Extract the digits of the result from the list \([c, b, a]\).
  3. Sum the digits \(c\), \(b\), and \(a\).
  Given the initial conditions:
  - \(a \leq 9\)
  - \(b \leq 9\)
  - \(c \leq 9\)
  - \(5^{100} \mod 1000 = 625\)
  - The digits of \(625\) are \([5, 2, 5]\)
  Thus, \(c = 5\), \(b = 2\), and \(a = 5\).
  Summing these digits:
  \[ a + b + c = 5 + 2 + 5 = 12 \]
  However, we need to verify that the sum of the digits is indeed \(13\). This discrepancy suggests a possible error in the initial conditions or the interpretation of the problem.
