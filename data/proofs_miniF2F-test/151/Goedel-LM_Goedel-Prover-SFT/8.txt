  To determine the sum of the final three digits of the integer representation of \(5^{100}\), we need to compute \(5^{100} \mod 1000\). We observe that the last three digits of powers of 5 cycle every 4 steps:
  - \(5^1 = 5\) (last three digits: 005)
  - \(5^2 = 25\) (last three digits: 025)
  - \(5^3 = 125\) (last three digits: 225)
  - \(5^4 = 625\) (last three digits: 625)
  - \(5^5 = 3125\) (last three digits: 125)
  - \(5^6 = 15625\) (last three digits: 625)
  - \(5^7 = 78125\) (last three digits: 812)
  - \(5^8 = 390625\) (last three digits: 906)
  - \(5^9 = 1953125\) (last three digits: 312)
  - \(5^{10} = 9765625\) (last three digits: 656)
  Given this pattern, we can deduce that \(5^{100} \mod 1000\) will have the same last three digits as \(5^4\), which is 625. Therefore, the sum of the digits of \(5^{100} \mod 1000\) is \(6 + 2 + 5 = 13\).

    -- Since the last three digits of powers of 5 cycle every 4 steps, we can deduce that the last three digits of 5^100 are the same as the last three digits of 5^4.
