  To solve the problem of finding the sum of the final three digits of the integer representation of \(5^{100}\), we need to compute \(5^{100} \mod 1000\). The sum of the digits of this result is then calculated. We are given that the sum of these digits is 13. We will use the provided Lean4 code to verify this.
