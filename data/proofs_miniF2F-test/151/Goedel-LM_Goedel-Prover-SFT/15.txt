  To solve the problem of finding the sum of the final three digits of the integer representation of \(5^{100}\), we need to compute \(5^{100} \mod 1000\) and then extract the digits from the resulting number. The key steps involve calculating \(5^{100} \mod 1000\) and then summing the digits of the result.
  1. **Compute \(5^{100} \mod 1000\):**
     - We use the fact that \(5^{100} \mod 1000\) can be computed directly using the properties of modular arithmetic.
  2. **Extract the digits:**
     - The result of \(5^{100} \mod 1000\) is a number that can be expressed as \(100a + 10b + c\) where \(a, b, c\) are digits (i.e., \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9\)).
  3. **Sum the digits:**
     - Given the digits \(a, b, c\), we sum them to get \(a + b + c\).
