  To determine the sum of the final three digits of the integer representation of \(5^{100}\), we start by analyzing the behavior of \(5^{100} \mod 1000\). We observe that the last three digits of powers of 5 cycle every 20 exponents. Specifically, \(5^{20} \equiv 1 \mod 1000\). Therefore, we can reduce the exponent 100 modulo 20 to simplify the calculation.
  Given \(5^{100} \equiv 5^{100 \mod 20} \equiv 5^0 \equiv 1 \mod 1000\), we see that the last three digits of \(5^{100}\) are 001. Summing these digits, we get \(0 + 0 + 1 = 1\). However, we need to verify the sum of the digits of \(5^{100}\).

  -- Since 100 % 20 = 0, we have 5^100 % 1000 = 5^0 % 1000 = 1 % 1000 = 1.

  -- The sum of the digits of 1 is 1, which matches our expected result.
