  To solve the problem of finding the sum of the final three digits of the integer representation of \(5^{100}\), we need to compute \(5^{100} \mod 1000\) and then extract the digits from the resulting number. Given that the digits are \(c\), \(b\), and \(a\), we sum these digits and verify that the sum is 13.
