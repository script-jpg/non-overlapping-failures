  To solve the problem of finding the sum of the final three digits of the integer representation of \(5^{100}\), we need to compute \(5^{100} \mod 1000\) and then identify the digits. Given the constraints \(a \leq 9\), \(b \leq 9\), and \(c \leq 9\), we can directly compute \(5^{100} \mod 1000\) and verify that the digits are \(c, b, a\). By analyzing the result, we find that \(a + b + c = 13\).

  -- We start by noting the given conditions and the goal.
  have h₂ := h₁
  have h₃ : a + b + c = 13 := by
    -- Normalize the numbers to simplify the expression.
    norm_num at h₂
    -- Use the omega tactic to solve the linear equation.
    omega
  -- Finally, we conclude the proof by stating the result.
