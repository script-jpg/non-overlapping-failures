  To solve the problem of finding the sum of the final three digits of the integer representation of \(5^{100}\), we need to compute \(5^{100} \mod 1000\) and then extract the digits of the result. The sum of these digits is then given by \(a + b + c\), where \(a, b, c\) are the digits of the result.
  1. Compute \(5^{100} \mod 1000\).
  2. Extract the digits of the result, denoted as \(a, b, c\).
  3. Sum the digits \(a + b + c\).
  Given the constraints \(a \leq 9\), \(b \leq 9\), and \(c \leq 9\), we can use the properties of modular arithmetic and the specific form of the digits to derive the sum.
