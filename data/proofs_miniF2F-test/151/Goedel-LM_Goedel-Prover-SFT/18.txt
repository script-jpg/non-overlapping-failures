  To solve the problem of finding the sum of the final three digits of \(5^{100}\), we start by calculating \(5^{100} \mod 1000\). We then use the digits of the resulting number to determine the sum of the final three digits. Given the constraints and the provided solution, we conclude that the sum of the digits is 13.

  -- Use the digits of the number 5^100 % 1000 to solve the problem.
  -- The digits are given as [c, b, a], and we need to show that a + b + c = 13.
