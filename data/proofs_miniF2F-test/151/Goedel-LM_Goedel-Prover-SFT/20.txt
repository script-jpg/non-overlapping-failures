  To solve the problem of finding the sum of the final three digits of the integer representation of \(5^{100}\), we start by analyzing the given information. The theorem states that for \(a, b, c \leq 9\), if the digits of \(5^{100} \mod 1000\) are \([c, b, a]\), then the sum \(a + b + c\) equals 13.
  Given the constraints \(a, b, c \leq 9\), we can use the provided digits \([c, b, a]\) to directly compute the sum \(a + b + c\). Since the digits are within the range 0 to 9, we can directly sum the digits and verify that the result is 13.

  -- Extract the condition that a ≤ 9
  have : a ≤ 9 := by linarith
  -- Extract the condition that b ≤ 9
  have : b ≤ 9 := by linarith
  -- Extract the condition that c ≤ 9
  have : c ≤ 9 := by linarith
  -- Use the given digits and the constraints to compute the sum a + b + c
  have : a + b + c = 13 := by
    -- Normalize the digits using the given hypothesis h₁
    norm_num at h₁
    -- Use interval_cases to check all possible values of a, b, c
    interval_cases a <;> interval_cases b <;> interval_cases c <;> omega
  -- Conclude the proof
