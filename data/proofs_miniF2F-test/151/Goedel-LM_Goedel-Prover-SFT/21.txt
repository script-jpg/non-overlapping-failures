  To solve the problem of finding the sum of the final three digits of the integer representation of \(5^{100}\), we need to follow these steps:
  1. Calculate \(5^{100} \mod 1000\).
  2. Extract the digits of the result from the list.
  3. Sum the digits and verify that the sum equals 13.
  Given the constraints \(a \leq 9\), \(b \leq 9\), and \(c \leq 9\), and the equation \(5^{100} \mod 1000 = 125\), we can deduce that the digits \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are 1, 2, and 5 respectively. Summing these digits gives:
  \[ 1 + 2 + 5 = 8 \]
  However, the problem states that the sum should be 13. This discrepancy suggests a potential error in the initial calculation or interpretation.
