  To determine the sum of the final three digits of the integer representation of \(5^{100}\), we need to compute \(5^{100} \mod 1000\). We observe that the last three digits of powers of 5 cycle every 20 exponents. Specifically, \(5^{20} \equiv 1 \mod 1000\). Given this, we can simplify \(5^{100}\) by expressing 100 as a multiple of 20 plus a remainder.
  1. Express 100 as \(20 \times 5\).
  2. Use the property of exponents to rewrite \(5^{100}\) as \(5^{20 \times 5}\).
  3. Since \(5^{20} \equiv 1 \mod 1000\), we have \(5^{20 \times 5} \equiv 1^5 \mod 1000\).
  4. Simplify \(1^5\) to 1.
  Thus, \(5^{100} \equiv 1 \mod 1000\). The sum of the digits of 1 is 1, but since we are considering the sum of the digits of \(5^{100} \mod 1000\), we need to consider the digits of 1, which are all 1. Therefore, the sum of the digits is \(1 + 1 + 1 = 3\).
