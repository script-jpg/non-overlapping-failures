  To solve the problem of finding the sum of the final three digits of the integer representation of \(5^{100}\), we need to compute \(5^{100} \mod 1000\) and then extract the digits of the resulting number. The goal is to show that the sum of these digits is 13.
  1. **Compute \(5^{100} \mod 1000\):**
     - We observe that the last three digits of powers of 5 repeat in a pattern. Specifically, \(5^n \mod 1000\) for \(n \geq 3\) stabilizes at a value that ends in 125.
  2. **Extract the digits:**
     - Given \(5^{100} \mod 1000 = 125\), the digits of 125 are 1, 2, and 5.
  3. **Sum the digits:**
     - The sum of the digits 1, 2, and 5 is \(1 + 2 + 5 = 8\).
  Thus, the sum of the final three digits of the integer representation of \(5^{100}\) is 8.
