  have h₂ : 5 ^ 100 % 1000 = 625 := by
    norm_num

  rw [h₂] at h₁
  simp_all
  omega
```

This proof is concise because:
1. We first calculate $5^{100} \bmod 1000$, which is $625$
2. This means the final three digits of $5^{100}$ are $625$
3. The sum of these digits is $6 + 2 + 5 = 13$
4. The Lean proof formalizes this by:
   - Using `norm_num` to compute the value of $5^{100} \bmod 1000$
   - Using `simp_all` to simplify the goal using the hypothesis
   - Using `omega` to solve the resulting arithmetic goal

The Lean proof is remarkably concise because Lean's automation can handle arithmetic computations and verify that $5^{100} \bmod 1000 = 625$, and that $6 + 2 + 5 = 13$.
