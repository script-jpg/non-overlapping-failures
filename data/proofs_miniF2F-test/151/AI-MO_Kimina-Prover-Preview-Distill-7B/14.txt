This proof is quite straightforward. We first calculate $5^{100} \bmod 1000$ which gives us the last three digits of $5^{100}$ as 625. This is done via norm_num which can compute modular exponentiation efficiently.

Then we destructure the hypothesis `h₁` which states that the digits of $5^{100} \bmod 1000$ in base 10 are [c, b, a]. Since 625 is represented as [5, 2, 6] in Lean (least significant digit first), we have a = 5, b = 2, c = 6.

Finally, we compute a + b + c = 5 + 2 + 6 = 13 using the `omega` tactic which can handle arithmetic goals.

The proof is now complete. We have shown that the sum of the final three digits of $5^{100}$ is 13.
