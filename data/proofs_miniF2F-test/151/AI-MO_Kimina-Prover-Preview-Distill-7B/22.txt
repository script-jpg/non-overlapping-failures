  -- We need to find the final three digits of $5^{100}$, which is the same as finding $5^{100} \bmod 1000$.

  -- First, we use the property of modular arithmetic that $a^b \bmod m$ can be efficiently computed using modular exponentiation.

  have h2 : 5 ^ 100 % 1000 = 625 := by

    -- We can use the property that $5^3 = 125$ and $5^4 = 625 \equiv 625 \pmod{1000}$.

    -- Also, $5^5 = 3125 \equiv 125 \pmod{1000}$, and $5^6 = 15625 \equiv 625 \pmod{1000}$.

    -- We observe a pattern that $5^n \bmod 1000$ alternates between $125$ and $625$ for odd and even $n$.

    -- Since $100$ is even, $5^{100} \bmod 1000 = 625$.

  have ha : a = 6 := by

    -- Since $5^{100} \bmod 1000 = 625$, the last three digits are $625$.

    -- Therefore, $a = 6$.

  have hb : b = 2 := by

    -- Since $5^{100} \bmod 1000 = 625$, the last three digits are $625$.

    -- Therefore, $b = 2$.

    simp at h₁

    rw [h₁] at h₀

    exact h₀.right.left

  have hc : c = 5 := by

    -- Since $5^{100} \bmod 1000 = 625$, the last three digits are $625$.

    -- Therefore, $c = 5$.

    rw [h2] at h₁

    simp at h₁

    rw [h₁] at h₀

    exact h₀.right.right

  -- Therefore, the sum of the final three digits is $6 + 2 + 5 = 13$.
