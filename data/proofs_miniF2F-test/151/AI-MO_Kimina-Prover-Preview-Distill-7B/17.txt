In this proof, we're asked to find the sum of the final three digits of $5^{100}$ in its integer representation. We're given that $a$, $b$, and $c$ are digits (each less than 10) and that the last three digits of $5^{100}$ are $[a, b, c]$ when represented in base 10. We need to prove that $a + b + c = 13$.

Let's think about how to approach this:

1. We need to compute $5^{100} \bmod 1000$ to find the last three digits of $5^{100}$.
2. We observe that $5^3 = 125$, $5^4 = 625$, $5^5 = 3125 \equiv 125 \pmod{1000}$, and so on.
3. We notice a pattern that $5^n \bmod 1000$ cycles with period 2 starting from $n=3$: $125, 625, 125, 625, \ldots$
4. Since $100$ is even, $5^{100} \equiv 625 \pmod{1000}$, meaning the last three digits are 625.
5. Thus $a = 5$, $b = 2$, $c = 6$, and $a + b + c = 5 + 2 + 6 = 13$.

In Lean, we'll formalize this as follows:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

We begin by importing the necessary libraries and setting up the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_341 (a b c : ℕ) (h₀ : a ≤ 9 ∧ b ≤ 9 ∧ c ≤ 9)
    (h₁ : Nat.digits 10 (5 ^ 100 % 1000) = [c, b, a]) : a + b + c = 13 := by
```

Now we need to compute $5^{100} \bmod 1000$. From our pattern observation, we expect $5^{100} \equiv 625 \pmod{1000}$.

Let's verify this by calculation:
- $5^3 = 125$
- $5^4 = 625$
- $5^5 \equiv 125 \pmod{1000}$
- $5^6 \equiv 625 \pmod{1000}$
-...

Since $100$ is even, $5^{100} \equiv 625 \pmod{1000}$, so the last three digits are 625.

Now, from the hypothesis `h₁: Nat.digits 10 (5 ^ 100 % 1000) = [c, b, a]`, we know that:
- The last three digits of $5^{100}$ are $[c, b, a]$ in base 10
- Since $5^{100} \equiv 625 \pmod{1000}$, we should have $[c, b, a] = [5, 2, 6]$
- Thus $a = 5$, $b = 2$, $c = 6$
- So $a + b + c = 5 + 2 + 6 = 13$

Let's complete the proof by computing $5^{100} \bmod 1000$ directly in Lean:

```tactics
have h₂ : 5 ^ 100 % 1000 = 625 := by
  norm_num
```

We've now established that $5^{100} \equiv 625 \pmod{1000}$. This means that the last three digits of $5^{100}$ are 625, so $[c, b, a] = [5, 2, 6]$.

Now let's finish the proof by using this to determine $a$, $b$, and $c$:

```tactics
rw [h₂] at h₁
simp_all
omega
```

In the final steps:
- We rewrite $5^{100} \bmod 1000$ as 625 using our lemma `h₂`
- After substitution, `h₁` becomes `Nat.digits 10 625 = [c, b, a]`
- Lean computes `Nat.digits 10 625 = [5, 2, 6]`, so $[c, b, a] = [5, 2, 6]$
- This means $c = 5$, $b = 2$, $a = 6$
- So $a + b + c = 6 + 2 + 5 = 13$

Therefore, the answer is 13.
