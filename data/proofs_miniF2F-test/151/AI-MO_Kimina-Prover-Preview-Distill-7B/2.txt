-- https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4227007/ what is the sum of the final three digits of the integer representation of $5^{100}$

    -- The goal is to find the sum of the final three digits of $5^{100}$ in its integer representation.

    -- We begin by analyzing the problem mathematically. The final three digits of a number are equivalent to the number modulo 1000.
    -- So we need to calculate $5^{100} \bmod 1000$.

    -- Using properties of modular arithmetic, we can simplify this calculation by using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.
    -- We'll break down the problem into finding $5^{100} \bmod 8$ and $5^{100} \bmod 125$, then combining the results.

    -- First, let's calculate $5^{100} \bmod 8$:
    -- Since $5 \equiv 5 \pmod{8}$, $5^2 = 25 \equiv 1 \pmod{8}$, and thus $5^{100} = (5^2)^{50} \equiv 1^{50} \equiv 1 \pmod{8}$.

    -- Now, let's calculate $5^{100} \bmod 125$:
    -- Since $5^3 = 125 \equiv 0 \pmod{125}$, we have $5^{100} = 5^{3 \cdot 33 + 1} = (5^3)^{33} \cdot 5 \equiv 0^{33} \cdot 5 \equiv 0 \pmod{125}$.

    -- Combining these results using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we need to find a number $x$ such that:
    -- $x \equiv 1 \pmod{8}$ and $x \equiv 0 \pmod{125}$.
    -- The solution to this congruence system is $x \equiv 625 \pmod{1000}$.

    -- Therefore, the final three digits of $5^{100}$ are 625, and their sum is $6 + 2 + 5 = 13$.
