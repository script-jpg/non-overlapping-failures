In this proof, we substituted $n = 11$ into the expression $\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^{n+1} \cdot 2^{2n}$ and simplified it to $\frac{1}{4}$. The calculation steps are as follows:
1. $\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^{11+1} \cdot 2^{2 \cdot 11} = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^{12} \cdot 2^{22}$
2. $\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^{12} \cdot 2^{22} = \frac{1}{4^{12}} \cdot 2^{22}$
3. $\frac{1}{4^{12}} \cdot 2^{22} = \frac{1}{(2^2)^{12}} \cdot 2^{22} = \frac{1}{2^{24}} \cdot 2^{22} = \frac{1}{2^2} = \frac{1}{4}$

The Lean proof uses the `ring` tactic to handle these algebraic manipulations automatically. The `ring` tactic in Lean is powerful for solving goals involving equalities in commutative rings, and it can handle the arithmetic of fractions and powers in this case.

Therefore, the final answer is $\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}$.
