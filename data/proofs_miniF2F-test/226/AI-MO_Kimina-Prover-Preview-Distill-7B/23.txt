This solution is straightforward. We first substitute $n = 11$ into the expression $\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^{n+1} \cdot 2^{2n}$. This gives us $\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^{12} \cdot 2^{22}$. 

To simplify this, notice that $\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^{12} = \frac{1^{12}}{4^{12}} = \frac{1}{4^{12}}$. 

Now, $4^{12} = (2^2)^{12} = 2^{2 \cdot 12} = 2^{24}$. 

So $\frac{1}{4^{12}} \cdot 2^{22} = \frac{1}{2^{24}} \cdot 2^{22} = \frac{2^{22}}{2^{24}} = \frac{1}{2^{2}} = \frac{1}{4}$.

The Lean proof uses `norm_num` to handle these arithmetic calculations automatically.

We begin by importing the necessary libraries and setting up the theorem statement. We need to prove that when $n = 11$, the expression $\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^{n+1} \cdot 2^{2n}$ equals $\frac{1}{4}$.

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_314 (n : ℕ) (h₀ : n = 11) : (1 / 4) ^ (n + 1) * 2 ^ (2 * n) = 1 / 4 := by
```

Now we have the theorem statement with $n$ as a natural number and the hypothesis $h₀: n = 11$. We need to prove that $(1/4)^{n+1} \cdot 2^{2n} = 1/4$ under this assumption.

The first step is to substitute $n = 11$ into the expression:

```tactics
subst n
```

After substitution, our goal becomes to prove that $(1/4)^{12} \cdot 2^{22} = 1/4$. 

To solve this algebraically:
- $(1/4)^{12} = 1/4^{12}$
- $4^{12} = (2^2)^{12} = 2^{24}$
- So $(1/4)^{12} = 1/2^{24}$
- $2^{22} = 2^{24-2} = 2^{24} \cdot 2^{-2}$
- Thus $(1/4)^{12} \cdot 2^{22} = (1/2^{24}) \cdot (2^{24} \cdot 2^{-2}) = 1/2^{2} = 1/4$

In Lean, we can use `norm_num` to handle these arithmetic calculations:

```tactics
norm_num
```

The `norm_num` tactic is powerful for solving goals involving arithmetic expressions with concrete numbers. It will compute $(1/4)^{12} \cdot 2^{22}$ directly and verify that it equals $1/4$.

Therefore, when $n = 11$, $\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^{n+1} \cdot 2^{2n} = \frac{1}{4}$.
