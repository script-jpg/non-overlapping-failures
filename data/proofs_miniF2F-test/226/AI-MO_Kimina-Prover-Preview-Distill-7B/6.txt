This completes the proof. The key insight is that when $n = 11$, the expression $\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^{n+1} \cdot 2^{2n}$ evaluates to $\frac{1}{4}$. This can be verified by substituting $n = 11$ and computing:

$\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^{12} \cdot 2^{22} = \frac{1}{4^{12}} \cdot 2^{22} = \frac{1}{2^{24}} \cdot 2^{22} = \frac{1}{2^{2}} = \frac{1}{4}$.

The Lean proof is elegant because it directly substitutes the value of $n$ and then performs numerical normalization to verify the equality.
