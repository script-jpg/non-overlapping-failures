-- Solve the system of linear equations by hand.

  -- The three equations are:

  -- 3a + b + c = -3        -- (1)
  -- a + 3b + c = 9         -- (2)
  -- a + b + 3c = 19        -- (3)

  -- Subtract (1) - (2): 2a - 2b = -12 -> a - b = -6 -> a = b - 6    -- (4)

  -- Subtract (1) - (3): 2a - 2c = -22 -> a - c = -11 -> a = c - 11   -- (5)

  -- From (4) and (5): b - 6 = c - 11 -> b = c - 5    -- (6)

  -- Substitute (6) into (1): 3(c-11) + (c-5) + c = -3

  -- 3c - 33 + c - 5 + c = -3 -> 5c = 35 -> c = 7   -- (7)

  -- Substitute (7) into (6): b = 7 - 5 = 2    -- (8)

  -- Substitute (8) into (7): a = 7 - 11 = -4    -- (9)

  -- Thus, a = -4, b = 2, c = 7.

  -- So, abc = -4 * 2 * 7 = -56.
