-- The idea is to use the `linarith` tactic to solve the system of equations and then
  -- use the values of $a$, $b$ and $c$ to compute $abc$.

  -- We have $a = -\frac{11}{2}, b = \frac{15}{2}, c = 8$
  have ha : a = (-11) / 2 := by linarith
  have hb : b = 15 / 2 := by linarith
  have hc : c = 8 := by linarith

  -- Substitute these values into $abc$ and simplify to get $abc = -56$.
