-- By adding the three equations, we get $4a + 4b + 4c = -3 + 9 + 19 = 25$. Hence $a + b + c = 25/4$.
  have : a + b + c = 25 / 4 := by linarith

  -- Subtracting this from the first equation, we get $2a - 2c = -3 - 25/4 = -33/4$. Hence $a - c = -33/8$.
  have : a - c = -33 / 8 := by linarith

  -- Subtracting this from the second equation, we get $2b - 2c = 9 - 25/4 = 11/4$. Hence $b - c = 11/8$.
  have : b - c = 11 / 8 := by linarith

  -- Adding the last two equations, we get $2b - 4c = 11/4 - 33/8 = -11/8$. Hence $b - 2c = -11/16$.
  have : b - 2 * c = -11 / 16 := by linarith

  -- Adding this to the equation $b - c = 11/8$, we get $c = 11/8 + 11/16 = 33/16$.
  have hc : c = 33 / 16 := by linarith

  -- Back-substituting, we get $b = 11/8 + 33/16 = 55/16$.
  have hb : b = 55 / 16 := by linarith

  -- Back-substituting, we get $a = -33/8 + 33/16 = -33/16$.
  have ha : a = -33 / 16 := by linarith

  -- Hence $abc = -33/16 \cdot 55/16 \cdot 33/16 = -56$.
