-- We have a system of three linear equations. Let's solve it to find the values of a, b and c.

  -- From the first equation: 3a + b + c = -3
  -- From the second equation: a + 3b + c = 9
  -- From the third equation: a + b + 3c = 19

  -- Subtract the first equation from the second: (a + 3b + c) - (3a + b + c) = 9 - (-3)
  -- Simplifying: -2a + 2b = 12 or a - b = -6

  -- Subtract the second equation from the third: (a + b + 3c) - (a + 3b + c) = 19 - 9
  -- Simplifying: -2b + 2c = 10 or b - c = -5

  -- Now we have a new system:
  -- a - b = -6
  -- b - c = -5

  -- From the first equation: a = b - 6
  -- From the second equation: c = b + 5

  -- Substitute into the first equation: 3(b - 6) + b + (b + 5) = -3
  -- Simplifying: 3b - 18 + b + b + 5 = -3
  -- 5b - 13 = -3
  -- 5b = 10
  -- b = 2

  -- Now: a = b - 6 = 2 - 6 = -4
  -- Also: c = b + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7

  have hb : b = 2 := by
    have h1 : a - b = -6 := by linarith
    have h2 : b - c = -5 := by linarith
    have h3 : 5 * b - 13 = -3 := by linarith [h₀, h1, h2]

  have ha : a = -4 := by linarith [hb]
  have hc : c = 7 := by linarith [hb]

  -- Check:
  -- a = -4, b = 2, c = 7
  -- 3a + b + c = 3(-4) + 2 + 7 = -12 + 2 + 7 = -3 ✓
  -- a + 3b + c = -4 + 3(2) + 7 = -4 + 6 + 7 = 9 ✓
  -- a + b + 3c = -4 + 2 + 3(7) = -4 + 2 + 21 = 19 ✓

  -- So abc = (-4)(2)(7) = -56 ✓
