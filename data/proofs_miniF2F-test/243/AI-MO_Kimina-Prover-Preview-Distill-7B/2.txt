  -- By substituting $c = 0$, we get $3a + b = -3$ and $a + 3b = 9$. After subtracting these two equations,
  -- we get $2b - 2a = 12$, or $b - a = 6$. If $b = a + 6$, then $3a + a + 6 + c = -3$, or $4a + c = -9$.
  -- Thus, $c = -9 - 4a$. By substituting $b = a + 6$ and $c = -9 - 4a$ into $a + b + 3c = 19$, we get
  -- $a + a + 6 + 3(-9 - 4a) = 19$, or $2a + 6 - 27 - 12a = 19$, or $-10a = 40$, or $a = -4$.
  -- By substituting $a = -4$ into $b = a + 6$, we get $b = 2$. By substituting $a = -4$ into $c = -9 - 4a$,
