-- To find the value of $abc$, we need to solve this system of equations.

  -- First, let's add all three equations:
  -- $(3a + b + c) + (a + 3b + c) + (a + b + 3c) = -3 + 9 + 19$,
  -- which simplifies to $5a + 5b + 5c = 25$.
  have h3 : a + b + c = 5 := by linarith

  -- Now, we can find each variable by subtracting the appropriate equation from $a + b + c = 5$:

  -- Subtracting $3a + b + c = -3$ from $a + b + c = 5$:
  -- $(a + b + c) - (3a + b + c) = 5 - (-3)$,
  -- which simplifies to $-2a = 8$.
  have ha : a = -4 := by linarith

  -- Subtracting $a + 3b + c = 9$ from $a + b + c = 5$:
  -- $(a + b + c) - (a + 3b + c) = 5 - 9$,
  -- which simplifies to $-2b = -4$.
  have hb : b = 2 := by linarith

  -- Subtracting $a + b + 3c = 19$ from $a + b + c = 5$:
  -- $(a + b + c) - (a + b + 3c) = 5 - 19$,
  -- which simplifies to $-2c = -14$.
  have hc : c = 7 := by linarith

  -- With $a = -4$, $b = 2$, and $c = 7$, we find $abc = (-4) \cdot 2 \cdot 7 = -56$.
