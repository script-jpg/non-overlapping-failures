-- We have a system of three linear equations. Let's solve it to find the values of a, b, c.

  -- From the first equation: 3a + b + c = -3
  have eq1 : 3 * a + b + c = -3 := h₀

  -- From the second equation: a + 3b + c = 9
  have eq2 : a + 3 * b + c = 9 := h₁

  -- From the third equation: a + b + 3c = 19
  have eq3 : a + b + 3 * c = 19 := h₂

  -- Let's try to solve this system algebraically first, then translate to Lean 4.

  -- If we subtract the first equation from the second, we get:
  -- (a + 3b + c) - (3a + b + c) = 9 - (-3)
  -- -2a + 2b = 12
  -- a - b = -6
  have eq4 : a - b = -6 := by
    linarith [eq1, eq2]

  -- If we subtract the second equation from the third, we get:
  -- (a + b + 3c) - (a + 3b + c) = 19 - 9
  -- -2b + 2c = 10
  -- b - c = -5
  have eq5 : b - c = -5 := by
    linarith [eq2, eq3]

  -- Now we have a - b = -6 and b - c = -5
  -- From a - b = -6, we get a = b - 6
  have ha : a = b - 6 := by linarith

  -- From b - c = -5, we get c = b + 5
  have hc : c = b + 5 := by linarith

  -- Now let's substitute a and c in terms of b into the first equation:
  -- 3a + b + c = -3
  -- 3(b - 6) + b + (b + 5) = -3
  -- 3b - 18 + b + b + 5 = -3
  -- 5b - 13 = -3
  -- 5b = 10
  -- b = 2
  have hb : b = 2 := by
    have : 3 * a + b + c = -3 := h₀
    rw [ha, hc] at this
    linarith

  -- Now that we have b = 2:
  -- a = b - 6 = 2 - 6 = -4
  have ha' : a = -4 := by
    rw [hb] at ha
    linarith

  -- c = b + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7
  have hc' : c = 7 := by
    rw [hb] at hc
    linarith

  -- Therefore, a = -4, b = 2, c = 7
  -- So, abc = (-4) * 2 * 7 = -56
