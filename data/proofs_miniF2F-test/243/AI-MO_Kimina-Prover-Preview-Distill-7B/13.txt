-- By manual computation, I get the following results. If you have better idea, please point out.
  -- The system of equations is linear, so it should be solved via linear method, not by arithmetic.
  -- Answer: $abc = -56.$
  -- If my result is wrong, then the down \uparrow of the system of equations matrix is wrong.
  -- From the first equation, $a = (-3-b-c)/3$. We substitute it into the other two equations.
  have h₃ : a = (-3-b-c)/3 := by linarith [h₀]
  rw [h₃] at h₁ h₂
  ring_nf at h₁ h₂

  -- Now we get a system of two equations with two variables. We can use linear method to solve it.
  -- From the first equation, we can get $b = (9+2c)/4$. We substitute it into the second equation.
  have h₄ : b = (9+2*c)/4 := by linarith [h₁]
  rw [h₄] at h₂
  ring_nf at h₂

  -- Now only $c$ is in the equation. We can get the value of $c$.
  have h₅ : c = 11/2 := by linarith [h₂]
  -- Substitute it into $b = (9+2c)/4$.
  rw [h₅] at h₄
  norm_num at h₄
  -- Substitute it into $a = (-3-b-c)/3$.
  rw [h₄, h₅] at h₃
  norm_num at h₃
  -- At last, we get the value of $abc$.
  have h₆ : a * b * c = -56 := by
    rw [h₃, h₄, h₅]
    norm_num
  exact h₆
