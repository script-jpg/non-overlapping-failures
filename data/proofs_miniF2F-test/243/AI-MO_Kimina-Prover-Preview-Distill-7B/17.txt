-- We have a system of three linear equations. Let's solve it to find the values of a, b, c.

  -- From the first equation: $3a + b + c = -3$
  -- From the second equation: $a + 3b + c = 9$
  -- From the third equation: $a + b + 3c = 19$

  -- Let's add all three equations: $(3a + b + c) + (a + 3b + c) + (a + b + 3c) = -3 + 9 + 19$
  -- This simplifies to $5a + 5b + 5c = 25$, or $a + b + c = 5$

  have h3 : a + b + c = 5 := by
    linarith

  -- Now we can find each variable by subtracting the appropriate equation from $a + b + c = 5$:

  -- Subtract the first equation ($3a + b + c = -3$) from $a + b + c = 5$:
  -- $(a + b + c) - (3a + b + c) = 5 - (-3)$
  -- $-2a = 8$
  -- $a = -4$

  have ha : a = -4 := by
    linarith

  -- Subtract the second equation ($a + 3b + c = 9$) from $a + b + c = 5$:
  -- $(a + b + c) - (a + 3b + c) = 5 - 9$
  -- $-2b = -4$
  -- $b = 2$

  have hb : b = 2 := by
    linarith

  -- Subtract the third equation ($a + b + 3c = 19$) from $a + b + c = 5$:
  -- $(a + b + c) - (a + b + 3c) = 5 - 19$
  -- $-2c = -14$
  -- $c = 7$

  have hc : c = 7 := by
    linarith

  -- Now that we have $a = -4$, $b = 2$, $c = 7$, we can find $abc = (-4) \cdot 2 \cdot 7 = -56$
