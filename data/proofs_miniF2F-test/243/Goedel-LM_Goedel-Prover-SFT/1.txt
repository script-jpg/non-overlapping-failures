  Given the equations:
  1. \(3a + b + c = -3\)
  2. \(a + 3b + c = 9\)
  3. \(a + b + 3c = 19\)
  We need to find the value of \(abc\).
  First, we solve for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) using the given equations. By manipulating these equations, we can isolate each variable. Then, we substitute the values back into the expression for \(abc\) to find its value.

  -- We start by adding all three equations together.
  have h₃ : a + b + c = 11 := by
    linarith [h₀, h₁, h₂]
  -- Now we solve for a using the sum of the equations.
  have h₄ : a = -4 := by
    linarith [h₀, h₁, h₂, h₃]
  -- Substitute a = -4 into the first equation to solve for b.
  have h₅ : b = 7 := by
    linarith [h₀, h₄]
  -- Substitute a = -4 and b = 7 into the third equation to solve for c.
  have h₆ : c = 8 := by
    linarith [h₂, h₄, h₅]
  -- Now we substitute the values of a, b, and c back into the expression for abc.
  rw [h₄, h₅, h₆]
  -- Finally, we verify that the product is indeed -56.
