  Given the equations:
  1. \(3a + b + c = -3\)
  2. \(a + 3b + c = 9\)
  3. \(a + b + 3c = 19\)
  We need to find the value of \(abc\).
  First, we solve for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) using the given equations. By manipulating the equations, we can isolate each variable. Then, we substitute these values back into the expression \(abc\) to find its value.
