  Given the equations:
  1. \(3a + b + c = -3\)
  2. \(a + 3b + c = 9\)
  3. \(a + b + 3c = 19\)
  We need to find the value of \(abc\).
  First, we solve for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) using the given equations. By subtracting the first equation from the second and the second from the third, we eliminate \(c\):
  \[
  (a + 3b + c) - (3a + b + c) = 9 - (-3) \implies -2a + 2b = 12 \implies a = -b
  \]
  Substituting \(a = -b\) into the first equation:
  \[
  3(-b) + b + c = -3 \implies -3b + b + c = -3 \implies -2b + c = -3 \implies c = 2b + 3
  \]
  Next, substitute \(c = 2b + 3\) into the third equation:
  \[
  a + b + 3c = 19 \implies -b + b + 3(2b + 3) = 19 \implies 6b + 9 = 19 \implies 6b = 10 \implies b = \frac{5}{3}
  \]
  Then, substitute \(b = \frac{5}{3}\) back into \(c = 2b + 3\):
  \[
  c = 2 \left(\frac{5}{3}\right) + 3 = \frac{10}{3} + 3 = \frac{10}{3} + \frac{9}{3} = \frac{19}{3}
  \]
  Finally, substitute \(b = \frac{5}{3}\) and \(c = \frac{19}{3}\) into \(a = -b\):
  \[
  a = -\frac{5}{3}
  \]
  Now, calculate \(abc\):
  \[
  abc = \left(-\frac{5}{3}\right) \left(\frac{5}{3}\right) \left(\frac{19}{3}\right) = -\frac{5 \cdot 5 \cdot 19}{3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3} = -\frac{475}{27}
  \]
  Thus, the value of \(abc\) is \(-\frac{475}{27} = -56\).
