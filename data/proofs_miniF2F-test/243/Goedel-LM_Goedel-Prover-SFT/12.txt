  Given the equations:
  1. \(3a + b + c = -3\)
  2. \(a + 3b + c = 9\)
  3. \(a + b + 3c = 19\)
  We need to find the value of \(abc\).
  First, we solve for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) using the given equations. By subtracting the first equation from the second and the second from the third, we eliminate \(b\) and \(c\) to solve for \(a\). Substituting \(a\) back into the original equations, we find \(b\) and \(c\). Finally, we compute \(abc\) to verify that it equals \(-56\).
