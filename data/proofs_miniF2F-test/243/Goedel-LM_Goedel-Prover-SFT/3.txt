  Given the equations \(3a + b + c = -3\), \(a + 3b + c = 9\), and \(a + b + 3c = 19\), we need to find the value of \(abc\). By using algebraic manipulations and solving the system of equations, we can derive the value of \(abc\).
  First, we solve for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) using the given equations. By adding the three equations together, we get:
  \[
  (3a + b + c) + (a + 3b + c) + (a + b + 3c) = -3 + 9 + 19
  \]
  Simplifying the left-hand side, we have:
  \[
  5a + 5b + 5c = 25
  \]
  Dividing both sides by 5, we obtain:
  \[
  a + b + c = 5
  \]
  Next, we solve for each variable by isolating it in one of the original equations. Using the first equation \(3a + b + c = -3\), we can express \(b + c\) as:
  \[
  b + c = -3 - 3a
  \]
  Substituting \(b + c\) into the equation \(a + b + c = 5\), we get:
  \[
  a + (-3 - 3a) = 5
  \]
  Simplifying this, we have:
  \[
  a - 3 - 3a = 5 \implies -2a - 3 = 5 \implies -2a = 8 \implies a = -4
  \]
  Using the second equation \(a + 3b + c = 9\), we substitute \(a = -4\):
  \[
  -4 + 3b + c = 9 \implies 3b + c = 13
  \]
  Substituting \(c = 13 - 3b\) into the equation \(a + b + 3c = 19\), we get:
  \[
  -4 + b + 3(13 - 3b) = 19 \implies -4 + b + 39 - 9b = 19 \implies -4 - 8b + 39 = 19 \implies 35 - 8b = 19 \implies 8b = 16 \implies b = 2
  \]
  Finally, substituting \(b = 2\) into \(c = 13 - 3b\), we get:
  \[
  c = 13 - 3(2) = 13 - 6 = 7
  \]
  Now, we calculate \(abc\):
  \[
  abc = (-4)(2)(7) = -56
  \]
  Thus, the value of \(abc\) is \(-56\).
