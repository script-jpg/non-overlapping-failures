  Given the equations \(3a + b + c = -3\), \(a + 3b + c = 9\), and \(a + b + 3c = 19\), we need to find the value of \(abc\). We will use algebraic manipulation and linear arithmetic to determine the value of \(abc\).
  First, we add the three given equations together:
  \[
  (3a + b + c) + (a + 3b + c) + (a + b + 3c) = -3 + 9 + 19
  \]
  Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:
  \[
  5a + 5b + 5c = 13
  \]
  Dividing both sides by 5, we obtain:
  \[
  a + b + c = \frac{13}{5}
  \]
  Next, we solve for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) by isolating each variable. We use the fact that the sum of the variables is \(\frac{13}{5}\). We can express \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in terms of each other and solve for their values.
  Using the first equation \(3a + b + c = -3\), we can substitute the values of \(b\) and \(c\) in terms of \(a\):
  \[
  b = -3 - 3a - c
  \]
  Substituting \(b\) into the second equation \(a + 3b + c = 9\):
  \[
  a + 3(-3 - 3a - c) + c = 9
  \]
  Simplifying this, we get:
  \[
  a - 9 - 9a - 3c + c = 9
  \]
  \[
  -8a - 9 - 2c = 9
  \]
  \[
  -8a - 2c = 18
  \]
  \[
  4a + c = -9
  \]
  Now, substituting \(c = -9 - 4a\) into the third equation \(a + b + 3c = 19\):
  \[
  a + (-3 - 3a - c) + 3c = 19
  \]
  Simplifying this, we get:
  \[
  a - 3 - 3a - c + 3c = 19
  \]
  \[
  -2a - 3 + 2c = 19
  \]
  \[
  -2a + 2c = 22
  \]
  \[
  a - c = -11
  \]
  Now we have two equations:
  1. \(4a + c = -9\)
  2. \(a - c = -11\)
  Adding these two equations:
  \[
  4a + c + a - c = -9 + (-11)
  \]
  \[
  5a = -20
  \]
  \[
  a = -4
  \]
  Substituting \(a = -4\) into \(a - c = -11\):
  \[
  -4 - c = -11
  \]
  \[
  c = 7
  \]
  Finally, substituting \(a = -4\) and \(c = 7\) into \(b = -3 - 3a - c\):
  \[
  b = -3 - 3(-4) - 7
  \]
  \[
  b = -3 + 12 - 7
  \]
  \[
  b = -8
  \]
  Thus, we have \(a = -4\), \(b = -8\), and \(c = 7\). The product \(abc\) is:
  \[
  abc = (-4)(-8)(7) = -56
  \]
