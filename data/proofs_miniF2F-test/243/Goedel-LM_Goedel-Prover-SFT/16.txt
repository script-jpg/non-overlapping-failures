  Given the equations:
  1. \(3a + b + c = -3\)
  2. \(a + 3b + c = 9\)
  3. \(a + b + 3c = 19\)
  We need to find the value of \(abc\).
  First, we solve the system of equations to find the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).
  By subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:
  \[ (a + 3b + c) - (3a + b + c) = 9 - (-3) \]
  \[ -2a + 2b = 12 \]
  \[ -a + b = 6 \]
  \[ b = a + 6 \]
  Next, substitute \(b = a + 6\) into the third equation:
  \[ a + (a + 6) + 3c = 19 \]
  \[ 2a + 6 + 3c = 19 \]
  \[ 2a + 3c = 13 \]
  Now, substitute \(b = a + 6\) into the first equation:
  \[ 3a + (a + 6) + c = -3 \]
  \[ 4a + 6 + c = -3 \]
  \[ 4a + c = -9 \]
  We now have two equations:
  1. \(2a + 3c = 13\)
  2. \(4a + c = -9\)
  Solve these equations simultaneously. Multiply the second equation by 3:
  \[ 12a + 3c = -27 \]
  Now, subtract the first equation from this result:
  \[ (12a + 3c) - (2a + 3c) = -27 - 13 \]
  \[ 10a = -40 \]
  \[ a = -4 \]
  Substitute \(a = -4\) back into the second equation:
  \[ 4(-4) + c = -9 \]
  \[ -16 + c = -9 \]
  \[ c = 7 \]
  Finally, substitute \(a = -4\) and \(c = 7\) into \(b = a + 6\):
  \[ b = -4 + 6 \]
  \[ b = 2 \]
  Now, calculate \(abc\):
  \[ abc = (-4)(2)(7) \]
  \[ abc = -56 \]
  Thus, the value of \(abc\) is \(-56\).
