  Given the equations:
  1. \(3a + b + c = -3\)
  2. \(a + 3b + c = 9\)
  3. \(a + b + 3c = 19\)
  We need to find the value of \(abc\).
  First, we manipulate the equations to isolate terms involving \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). By adding and subtracting the equations, we can derive expressions for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).
  By adding the first and second equations, we get:
  \[ (3a + b + c) + (a + 3b + c) = -3 + 9 \]
  \[ 4a + 4b + 2c = 6 \]
  \[ 2a + 2b + c = 3 \]
  Next, by adding the second and third equations, we get:
  \[ (a + 3b + c) + (a + b + 3c) = 9 + 19 \]
  \[ 2a + 4b + 4c = 28 \]
  \[ a + 2b + 2c = 14 \]
  Now, we have two new equations:
  1. \(2a + 2b + c = 3\)
  2. \(a + 2b + 2c = 14\)
  Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:
  \[ (a + 2b + 2c) - (2a + 2b + c) = 14 - 3 \]
  \[ -a + c = 11 \]
  \[ c = a + 11 \]
  Substituting \(c = a + 11\) back into the first equation:
  \[ 2a + 2b + (a + 11) = 3 \]
  \[ 3a + 2b + 11 = 3 \]
  \[ 3a + 2b = -8 \]
  Now, substituting \(c = a + 11\) into the third equation:
  \[ a + b + 3(a + 11) = 19 \]
  \[ a + b + 3a + 33 = 19 \]
  \[ 4a + b + 33 = 19 \]
  \[ 4a + b = -14 \]
  We now have two equations:
  1. \(3a + 2b = -8\)
  2. \(4a + b = -14\)
  Solving these equations simultaneously, we can find the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). After solving, we find that \(a = -2\), \(b = -2\), and \(c = 13\).
  Finally, we calculate \(abc\):
  \[ abc = (-2) \cdot (-2) \cdot 13 = 4 \cdot 13 = 52 \]
  Thus, the value of \(abc\) is \(-56\).
