  Given the equations \(3a + b + c = -3\), \(a + 3b + c = 9\), and \(a + b + 3c = 19\), we need to find the value of \(abc\). We will use algebraic manipulation and simplification to derive the result.
  1. Start by isolating \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) from the given equations.
  2. Use the fact that the sum of the coefficients in each equation is consistent with the given values to solve for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).
  3. Substitute the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) back into the expression \(abc\) to find the final result.
