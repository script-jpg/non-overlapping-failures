  Given the equations:
  1. \(3a + b + c = -3\)
  2. \(a + 3b + c = 9\)
  3. \(a + b + 3c = 19\)
  We need to find the value of \(abc\).
  First, we solve for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) using the given equations. By manipulating the equations, we can isolate each variable. Then, we substitute the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) back into the expression \(abc\) to find its value.

  -- We need to solve for a, b, and c using the given equations.
  have : a * b * c = -56 := by
    -- Use nlinarith to solve the system of linear equations and derive the value of abc.
    nlinarith [mul_self_nonneg (a + b + c), mul_self_nonneg (a - b), mul_self_nonneg (b - c),
      mul_self_nonneg (c - a)]
  -- The derived value of abc is -56.
