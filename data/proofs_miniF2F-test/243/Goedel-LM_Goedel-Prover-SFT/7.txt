  Given the equations:
  1. \(3a + b + c = -3\)
  2. \(a + 3b + c = 9\)
  3. \(a + b + 3c = 19\)
  We need to find the value of \(abc\).
  First, we solve for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) using the given equations. By subtracting the second equation from the first, we eliminate \(c\) and solve for \(a\) and \(b\). Substituting these values back into the third equation, we solve for \(c\). Finally, we compute \(abc\).
