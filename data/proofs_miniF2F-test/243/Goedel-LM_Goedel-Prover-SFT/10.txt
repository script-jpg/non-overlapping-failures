  Given the equations \(3a + b + c = -3\), \(a + 3b + c = 9\), and \(a + b + 3c = 19\), we need to find the value of \(abc\). By manipulating these equations, we can derive the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).
  1. Start with the given equations:
     \[
     3a + b + c = -3
     \]
     \[
     a + 3b + c = 9
     \]
     \[
     a + b + 3c = 19
     \]
  2. Add all three equations together:
     \[
     (3a + b + c) + (a + 3b + c) + (a + b + 3c) = -3 + 9 + 19
     \]
     \[
     5a + 5b + 5c = 25
     \]
     \[
     a + b + c = 5
     \]
  3. Substitute \(a + b + c = 5\) into each equation to find \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):
     \[
     3a + b + c = -3
     \]
     \[
     a + 3b + c = 9
     \]
     \[
     a + b + 3c = 19
     \]
  4. Solve for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) using the simplified equations:
     \[
     3a + b + c = -3
     \]
     \[
     a + 3b + c = 9
     \]
     \[
     a + b + 3c = 19
     \]
  5. Finally, calculate \(abc\) using the derived values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):
     \[
     abc = -56
     \]
