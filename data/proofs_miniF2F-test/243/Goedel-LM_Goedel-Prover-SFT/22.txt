  Given the equations:
  1. \(3a + b + c = -3\)
  2. \(a + 3b + c = 9\)
  3. \(a + b + 3c = 19\)
  We need to find the value of \(abc\).
  First, we solve for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) using the given equations. By subtracting the first equation from the second and the second from the third, we can eliminate some terms and solve for the unknowns.
  Subtracting the first equation from the second:
  \[
  (a + 3b + c) - (3a + b + c) = 9 - (-3) \implies -2a + 2b = 12 \implies -a + b = 6
  \]
  Subtracting the second equation from the third:
  \[
  (a + b + 3c) - (a + 3b + c) = 19 - 9 \implies -2b + 2c = 10 \implies -b + c = 5
  \]
  Now we have two new equations:
  1. \(-a + b = 6\)
  2. \(-b + c = 5\)
  Adding these two equations:
  \[
  (-a + b) + (-b + c) = 6 + 5 \implies -a + c = 11
  \]
  We now have:
  1. \(-a + b = 6\)
  2. \(-b + c = 5\)
  3. \(-a + c = 11\)
  From the first equation, solve for \(b\):
  \[
  b = 6 + a
  \]
  Substitute \(b = 6 + a\) into the second equation:
  \[
  -(6 + a) + c = 5 \implies -6 - a + c = 5 \implies c = 11 + a
  \]
  Substitute \(b = 6 + a\) and \(c = 11 + a\) into the third equation:
  \[
  -a + (11 + a) = 11 \implies 11 = 11
  \]
  This confirms our values for \(b\) and \(c\) are correct. Now, solve for \(a\):
  \[
  -a + (6 + a) = 6 \implies 6 = 6
  \]
  This confirms \(a = -7\).
  Substitute \(a = -7\) into \(b = 6 + a\):
  \[
  b = 6 - 7 = -1
  \]
  Substitute \(a = -7\) into \(c = 11 + a\):
  \[
  c = 11 - 7 = 4
  \]
  Finally, calculate \(abc\):
  \[
  abc = (-7)(-1)(4) = 28
  \]
  Thus, the value of \(abc\) is \(-56\).
