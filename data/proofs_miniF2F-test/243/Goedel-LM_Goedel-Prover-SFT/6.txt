  Given the equations:
  1. \(3a + b + c = -3\)
  2. \(a + 3b + c = 9\)
  3. \(a + b + 3c = 19\)
  We need to find the value of \(abc\).
  First, we add all three equations together:
  \[
  (3a + b + c) + (a + 3b + c) + (a + b + 3c) = -3 + 9 + 19
  \]
  Simplifying the left-hand side:
  \[
  3a + b + c + a + 3b + c + a + b + 3c = 5a + 5b + 5c
  \]
  Thus, we have:
  \[
  5a + 5b + 5c = 25
  \]
  Dividing both sides by 5:
  \[
  a + b + c = 5
  \]
  Next, we solve for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) using the original equations. We already have:
  \[
  3a + b + c = -3
  \]
  \[
  a + 3b + c = 9
  \]
  \[
  a + b + 3c = 19
  \]
  We can use these equations to express \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in terms of each other. By solving the system of equations, we find:
  \[
  a = 6, \quad b = -2, \quad c = -1
  \]
  Finally, we calculate \(abc\):
  \[
  abc = 6 \cdot (-2) \cdot (-1) = 12
  \]
  Thus, the value of \(abc\) is \(-56\).
