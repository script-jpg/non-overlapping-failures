  Given the equations:
  1. \(3a + b + c = -3\)
  2. \(a + 3b + c = 9\)
  3. \(a + b + 3c = 19\)
  We need to find the value of \(abc\).
  First, we solve for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) using the given equations. By manipulating these equations, we can isolate each variable. Then, we substitute the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) into the expression \(abc\) to find its value.

  have h₁' := h₁.symm
  have h₂' := h₂.symm
  -- Normalize the equations by expanding and simplifying them.
