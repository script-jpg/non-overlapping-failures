  Given the equations \(3a + b + c = -3\), \(a + 3b + c = 9\), and \(a + b + 3c = 19\), we need to find \(abc\). We will show that \(abc = -56\).
  First, we rewrite the equations in a standard polynomial form:
  1. \(3a + b + c = -3\)
  2. \(a + 3b + c = 9\)
  3. \(a + b + 3c = 19\)
  Next, we use the `nlinarith` tactic to solve the system of linear equations. This tactic is designed to handle nonlinear arithmetic problems by leveraging a combination of algebraic simplification and linear arithmetic.
  By applying `nlinarith`, we can derive the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy all three equations. Finally, we compute the product \(abc\) and verify that it equals \(-56\).
