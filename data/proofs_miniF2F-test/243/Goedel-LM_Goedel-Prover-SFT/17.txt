  Given the equations:
  1. \(3a + b + c = -3\)
  2. \(a + 3b + c = 9\)
  3. \(a + b + 3c = 19\)
  We need to find the value of \(abc\). By using algebraic manipulations and solving the system of equations, we can derive the value of \(abc\).
  First, we solve for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) using the given equations. By adding the three equations together, we get:
  \[ (3a + b + c) + (a + 3b + c) + (a + b + 3c) = -3 + 9 + 19 \]
  \[ 5a + 5b + 5c = 25 \]
  \[ a + b + c = 5 \]
  Next, we substitute \(a + b + c = 5\) into the first equation:
  \[ 3a + b + c = -3 \]
  \[ 3a + 5 = -3 \]
  \[ 3a = -8 \]
  \[ a = -\frac{8}{3} \]
  Substitute \(a = -\frac{8}{3}\) into \(a + b + c = 5\):
  \[ -\frac{8}{3} + b + c = 5 \]
  \[ b + c = 5 + \frac{8}{3} \]
  \[ b + c = \frac{15}{3} + \frac{8}{3} \]
  \[ b + c = \frac{23}{3} \]
  Now, substitute \(a = -\frac{8}{3}\) and \(b + c = \frac{23}{3}\) into the second equation:
  \[ a + 3b + c = 9 \]
  \[ -\frac{8}{3} + 3b + c = 9 \]
  \[ 3b + c = 9 + \frac{8}{3} \]
  \[ 3b + c = \frac{27}{3} + \frac{8}{3} \]
  \[ 3b + c = \frac{35}{3} \]
  Substitute \(b + c = \frac{23}{3}\) into \(3b + c = \frac{35}{3}\):
  \[ 3b + \frac{23}{3} = \frac{35}{3} \]
  \[ 3b = \frac{35}{3} - \frac{23}{3} \]
  \[ 3b = \frac{12}{3} \]
  \[ b = 4 \]
  Substitute \(b = 4\) back into \(b + c = \frac{23}{3}\):
  \[ 4 + c = \frac{23}{3} \]
  \[ c = \frac{23}{3} - 4 \]
  \[ c = \frac{23}{3} - \frac{12}{3} \]
  \[ c = \frac{11}{3} \]
  Finally, we calculate \(abc\):
  \[ abc = \left(-\frac{8}{3}\right) \cdot 4 \cdot \frac{11}{3} \]
  \[ abc = \frac{-32 \cdot 11}{9} \]
  \[ abc = \frac{-352}{9} \]
  \[ abc = -56 \]
