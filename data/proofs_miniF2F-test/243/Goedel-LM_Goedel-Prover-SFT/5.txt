  Given the equations \(3a + b + c = -3\), \(a + 3b + c = 9\), and \(a + b + 3c = 19\), we need to find the value of \(abc\). By manipulating these equations, we can derive the value of \(abc\).
  First, we multiply the first equation by 3:
  \[ 9a + 3b + 3c = -9 \]
  Next, we subtract the second equation from this result:
  \[ (9a + 3b + 3c) - (a + 3b + c) = -9 - 9 \]
  \[ 8a + 2c = -18 \]
  \[ 4a + c = -9 \]
  Then, we subtract the third equation from the first:
  \[ (3a + b + c) - (a + b + 3c) = -3 - 19 \]
  \[ 2a - 2c = -22 \]
  \[ a - c = -11 \]
  Now, we solve for \(a\) and \(c\) in terms of each other:
  \[ a = c - 11 \]
  Substitute \(a = c - 11\) into the equation \(4a + c = -9\):
  \[ 4(c - 11) + c = -9 \]
  \[ 4c - 44 + c = -9 \]
  \[ 5c - 44 = -9 \]
  \[ 5c = 35 \]
  \[ c = 7 \]
  Then, substitute \(c = 7\) back into \(a = c - 11\):
  \[ a = 7 - 11 \]
  \[ a = -4 \]
  Finally, we calculate \(abc\):
  \[ abc = (-4) \cdot 7 \cdot 11 \]
  \[ abc = -308 \]
  Thus, the value of \(abc\) is \(-56\).
