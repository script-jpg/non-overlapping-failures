  Given the equations:
  1. \(3a + b + c = -3\)
  2. \(a + 3b + c = 9\)
  3. \(a + b + 3c = 19\)
  We need to find the value of \(abc\).
  First, we solve for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) using the given equations. By subtracting the first equation from the second and the second from the third, we eliminate \(c\) and solve for \(a\) and \(b\).
  Subtracting the first equation from the second:
  \[
  (a + 3b + c) - (3a + b + c) = 9 - (-3)
  \]
  \[
  -2a + 2b = 12
  \]
  \[
  -a + b = 6
  \]
  \[
  b = a + 6
  \]
  Subtracting the second equation from the third:
  \[
  (a + b + 3c) - (a + 3b + c) = 19 - 9
  \]
  \[
  -2b + 2c = 10
  \]
  \[
  -b + c = 5
  \]
  \[
  c = b + 5
  \]
  Now, substituting \(b = a + 6\) and \(c = b + 5\) into the first equation:
  \[
  3a + (a + 6) + (b + 5) = -3
  \]
  \[
  3a + a + 6 + b + 5 = -3
  \]
  \[
  4a + b + 11 = -3
  \]
  \[
  4a + b = -14
  \]
  Since \(b = a + 6\), substitute \(b\) in the equation:
  \[
  4a + (a + 6) = -14
  \]
  \[
  5a + 6 = -14
  \]
  \[
  5a = -20
  \]
  \[
  a = -4
  \]
  Now, substitute \(a = -4\) back into \(b = a + 6\):
  \[
  b = -4 + 6 = 2
  \]
  Finally, substitute \(a = -4\) and \(b = 2\) into \(c = b + 5\):
  \[
  c = 2 + 5 = 7
  \]
  Now, we calculate \(abc\):
  \[
  abc = (-4) \cdot 2 \cdot 7 = -56
  \]
  Thus, the value of \(abc\) is \(-56\).
