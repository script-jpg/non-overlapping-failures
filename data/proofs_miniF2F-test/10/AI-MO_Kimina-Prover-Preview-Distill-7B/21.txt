-- Let me think about this problem. We need to find the remainder when the sum $1+2+3+...+100$ is divided by 6.

  -- First, I need to calculate the sum. This is an arithmetic series with the first term $a_1 = 1$, last term $a_n = 100$, and $n = 100$ terms.
  --
  -- The formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence is $S_n = \frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n)$.
  -- So our sum is $S_{100} = \frac{100}{2}(1 + 100) = 50 \cdot 101 = 5050$.

  -- Now, I need to find $5050 \bmod 6$.
  --
  -- To compute this, I can divide $5050$ by $6$ and find the remainder. $5050 ÷ 6 = 841$ with a remainder of $4$.
  --
  -- So $5050 \bmod 6 = 4$.

  -- Let's formalize this in Lean 4:

  calc (∑ k in Finset.range 101, k) % 6 = 5050 % 6 := by
    -- Lean can compute this sum automatically. The range 0 to 100 represents the numbers 0 through 100, and Lean's arithmetic can compute the sum.
    rfl
  _ = 4 := by
    -- Now Lean needs to compute 5050 % 6. As we calculated, this should be 4.
