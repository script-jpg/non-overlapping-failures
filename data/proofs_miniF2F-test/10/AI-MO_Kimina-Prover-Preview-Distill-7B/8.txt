-- The sum is equal to $100 \cdot 101 / 2 = 5050$. What is the remainder of $5050$ when divided by $6$? We can observe that the remainder of $5050$ when divided by $6$ is equal to the remainder of $5050 \cdot 10000$ when divided by $6$. It is because the remainder of a number when divided by $6$ depends only on the last six digits of the number. Now, $5050 \cdot 10000 = 50500000$, and we can see that the remainder of $50500000$ when divided by $6$ is equal to the remainder of $50500$ when divided by $6$. (We can also prove this by using the ring tactic.) Finally, we can see that the remainder of $50500$ when divided by $6$ is equal to the remainder of $50500000$ when divided by $6$. The remainder of $50500000$ when divided by $6$ is equal to the remainder of $50500000 + 50500000$ when divided by $6$. We can continue in this way until we reach $50500000 + 50500000 + \dots + 50500000$ ($6$ times), and then we get $50500000 \cdot 6$, whose remainder when divided by $6$ is clearly $0$. So, the remainder of $5050$ when divided by $6$ is $0$ as well. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{0}$.
