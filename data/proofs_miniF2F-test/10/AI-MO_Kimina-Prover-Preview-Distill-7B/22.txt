-- We arrange the numbers in a rectangle shape: 1 is in the first position, 2 in the second, 4 in the fourth, 5 in the fifth, 7 in the seventh etc. 
  -- The general pattern is: for an even column number $2n$, the sum of the numbers in that column is $n(2n+1)$.
  -- For an odd column number $2n+1$, the sum of the numbers in that column is $(n+1)(2n+1)$.
  have h_sum : ∑ k in Finset.range 101, k = 5050 := by
    rw [Finset.sum_range_succ]
    norm_num

  -- We see that the rectangle above has $5050$ dots, and the formula gives us that the remainder is 5050 % 6 = 4.
  rw [h_sum]
