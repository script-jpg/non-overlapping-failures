-- Compute the sum and then take the modulo
  native_decide

  -- If we want to compute the sum in a more mathematical way, we can write
  -- $1+2+3+4+\dots+98+99+100 = 100 \cdot 101 / 2 = 5050.$ Now we can observe that
  -- $5050 = 842 \cdot 6 + 2$, hence the remainder is $2$. But this is incorrect!

  -- Let me recalculate. We have $100 \cdot 101 / 2 = 5050$, and
  -- $5050 = 833 \cdot 6 + 4 + 2$, so the remainder is actually $4 + 2 = 6$, which is incorrect
  -- again. Let me be more careful. $5050 = 833 \cdot 6 + 4 + 2 - 6 = 833 \cdot 6 + 4$, so the
  -- remainder is indeed $4$.

  -- Now I need to formalize this in Lean. First, I need to import the necessary libraries:

  -- import Mathlib
  -- import Aesop

  -- I can also turn off the heartbeats:

  -- set_option maxHeartbeats 0

  -- and open some common namespaces:

  -- open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat

  -- Now, let's state the theorem:

  -- theorem mathd_numbertheory_237 : (∑ k in Finset.range 101, k) % 6 = 4 := by

  -- Now I need to prove this. The sum is 5050, and 5050 = 833 * 6 + 4, so the remainder is 4.
  -- The Lean proof is remarkably concise:

  -- native_decide

  -- This tactic computes the sum and the modulo directly, confirming our answer.
  -- The Lean system is able to compute concrete values like these directly.

  -- If we wanted to compute the sum more explicitly, we could use the formula for the sum of
  -- an arithmetic sequence: $n(n+1)/2$ for the first $n$ natural numbers. In this case, with
  -- $n = 100$, we get $100 \cdot 101 / 2 = 5050$.

  -- To compute $5050 \bmod 6$, we can divide $5050$ by $6$ to get a quotient of $833$ with a remainder of $4$.
  -- Thus, $5050 \equiv 4 \pmod{6}$, which is our answer.

  -- The Lean proof is complete. The answer is indeed $\boxed{4}$.
