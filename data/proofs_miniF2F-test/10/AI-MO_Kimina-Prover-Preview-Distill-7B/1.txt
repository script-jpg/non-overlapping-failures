-- The sum is equal to $100 \cdot 101 / 2 = 5050$. What is the remainder of $5050$ when divided by $6$? We perform the division $6$)$5050$ to find the remainder. $6$ goes into $5050$ a total of $841$ times with a remainder of $4$. To verify, we can calculate $6 \cdot 841 = 5046$ and $5050 - 5046 = 4$. Since $4 < 6$, the remainder is indeed $4$.
