The proof is remarkably concise because Lean can compute this arithmetic expression directly. The sum of numbers from 0 to 100 is calculated as 100 * 101 / 2 = 5050. When we take 5050 modulo 6, we get 4 because 5050 = 6 * 840 + 4. Lean's computational engine is able to evaluate this arithmetic goal directly, which is why the proof is so short. The `rfl` tactic is proving that the left-hand side (the sum modulo 6) is definitionally equal to the right-hand side (4).

In more detail, Lean is:
1. Computing the sum ∑ k in Finset.range 101, k, which is 0 + 1 + 2 +... + 100 = 5050
2. Computing 5050 % 6
3. Verifying that 5050 % 6 = 4

Since Lean can compute these arithmetic facts directly, the proof is extremely straightforward. This is a great example of how Lean's computational capability allows it to verify simple arithmetic properties without requiring complex proof steps.
