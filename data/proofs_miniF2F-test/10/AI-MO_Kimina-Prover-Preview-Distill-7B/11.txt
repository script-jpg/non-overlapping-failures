-- The sum is equal to $100 \cdot 101 / 2 = 5050$. What is the remainder of $5050$ when divided by $6$? We can write $5050 = 6 \cdot 841 + 4$, so the remainder is $4$. Let's see if we can compute this without using the formula for the sum.

  -- We need to compute the sum $1+2+3+4+\dots+98+99+100$.
  -- Notice that, since $6$ is a divisor of $12$, we have that $1+2+3+4 \equiv 10 \pmod{6}$.
  -- Also, $10$ is congruent to $4 \pmod{6}$. What is the sum $1+2+3+4+\dots+98+99+100$? We can rewrite this sum as $(1+2+3+4) + (5+6+7+8) + \dots + (97+98+99+100)$. We have $25$ groups of $1+2+3+4$ in this sum, and the sum $5+6+7+8 + \dots + 97+98+99+100$ has the same remainder as $25 \cdot (1+2+3+4) = 25 \cdot 10 = 250$. What is the remainder of $250$ when divided by $6$? We can write $250 = 6 \cdot 41 + 4$, so the remainder is 4.

  -- Let me reflect on what we've proven. We showed that the sum of the first $100$ positive integers is $5050$, which has remainder $4$ when divided by $6$. We did this by writing the sum as $(1+2+3+4) + (5+6+7+8) + \dots + (97+98+99+100)$, where each of the $25$ groups has sum $10$, and then noting that $250$ has remainder $4$ when divided by $6$. The key insight was that $1+2+3+4 \equiv 10 \equiv 4 \pmod{6}$, so the sum $1+2+3+4+\dots+97+98+99+100$ is congruent to $25 \cdot (1+2+3+4) \equiv 25 \cdot 4 \equiv 4 \pmod{6}$.

  -- This is a great example of how modular arithmetic can simplify calculations! Instead of adding up all $100$ numbers directly, we were able to break them into $25$ groups of $4$ numbers each, and compute the remainder of just $4$ numbers. This is much more efficient, and it's a technique that will be useful in more complex problems as well.
