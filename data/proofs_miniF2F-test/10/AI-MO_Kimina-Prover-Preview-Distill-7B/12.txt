-- The sum is equal to $100 \cdot 101 / 2 = 5050$. To see this, note that we can pair the terms $1 + 100 = 101$, $2 + 99 = 101$, and so on.  There are $100/2 = 50$ such pairs, so the sum is $50 \cdot 101 = 5050$.

In this proof, we first calculate the sum of numbers from 0 to 100, which is 5050. This is done by recognizing that we can pair numbers from the start and end of the sequence: $1 + 100 = 101$, $2 + 99 = 101$, and so on. Since there are 100 numbers, there are $100/2 = 50$ such pairs, each summing to 101. Therefore, the total sum is $50 \cdot 101 = 5050$.

Then, we calculate $5050 \bmod 6$. Since $5050 = 6 \cdot 841 + 4$, the remainder when 5050 is divided by 6 is 4. Thus, the modulo 6 remainder of the sum is 4.

The Lean proof follows this reasoning exactly, first establishing that the sum equals 5050 using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence, and then computing the remainder when 5050 is divided by 6.
