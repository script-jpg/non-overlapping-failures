  To determine the modulo 6 remainder of the sum \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \dots + 98 + 99 + 100\), we first calculate the sum of the first 100 natural numbers. The sum of the first \(n\) natural numbers is given by the formula \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\). For \(n = 100\), this sum is \(\frac{100 \cdot 101}{2} = 5050\).
  Next, we find the remainder of 5050 when divided by 6. We can use the property that \(5050 \mod 6\) is equivalent to \((5050 \mod 6) \mod 6\). Since 5050 is divisible by 6, the remainder is 0. However, we need to verify the exact remainder using numerical methods.
