  To show that the modulo 6 remainder of the sum \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \dots + 98 + 99 + 100\) is 4, we start by calculating the sum of the first 100 natural numbers. The sum of the first \(n\) natural numbers is given by the formula \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\). For \(n = 100\), this sum is \(\frac{100 \cdot 101}{2} = 5050\).
  Next, we need to find the remainder of 5050 when divided by 6. We can perform this by checking the sum modulo 6 directly:
  \[ 5050 \div 6 = 841 \text{ remainder } 4 \]
  Thus, \(5050 \equiv 4 \pmod{6}\).
