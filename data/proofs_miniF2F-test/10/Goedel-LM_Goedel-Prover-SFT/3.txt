  To determine the modulo 6 remainder of the sum \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \dots + 98 + 99 + 100\), we first calculate the sum of the first 100 natural numbers using the formula for the sum of the first \(n\) natural numbers, which is \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\). For \(n = 100\), this sum is \(\frac{100 \cdot 101}{2} = 5050\).
  Next, we need to find \(5050 \mod 6\). We can simplify this by noting that \(5050\) is divisible by \(2\) and \(3\), so we can use the fact that \(5050 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 838\). Since \(838 \mod 6\) is \(4\), we have \(5050 \mod 6 = 4\).
