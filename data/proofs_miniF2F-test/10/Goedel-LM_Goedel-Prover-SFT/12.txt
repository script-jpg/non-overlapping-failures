  To determine the modulo 6 remainder of the sum \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \dots + 98 + 99 + 100\), we first calculate the sum of the first 100 natural numbers. The sum of the first \(n\) natural numbers is given by the formula \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\). For \(n = 100\), this sum is \(\frac{100 \cdot 101}{2} = 5050\). We then compute \(5050 \mod 6\). Since \(5050 = 6 \cdot 841 + 4\), the remainder when \(5050\) is divided by 6 is 4.
