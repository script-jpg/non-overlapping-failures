  To determine the modulo 6 remainder of the sum \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \dots + 98 + 99 + 100\), we first compute the sum of the first 100 natural numbers. The sum of the first \(n\) natural numbers is given by the formula \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\). For \(n = 100\), this sum is \(\frac{100 \cdot 101}{2} = 5050\).
  Next, we find the remainder of 5050 when divided by 6. We can do this by checking the remainder of each number from 1 to 100 modulo 6. The sum of these remainders is calculated to be 4.

  -- The sum of the first 100 natural numbers is 5050.
  -- We need to find the remainder of 5050 when divided by 6, which is 4.
