  To determine the modulo 6 remainder of the sum \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \dots + 98 + 99 + 100\), we first compute the sum of the first 100 natural numbers. The sum of the first \(n\) natural numbers is given by the formula \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\). For \(n = 100\), this sum is \(\frac{100 \cdot 101}{2} = 5050\).
  Next, we compute \(5050 \mod 6\). We can simplify this by noting that \(5050\) is exactly 2 more than \(5048\), which is a multiple of 6. Therefore, \(5050 \equiv 2 \mod 6\). However, we need to verify the exact remainder.
  By performing the division, we find that \(5050 \div 6 = 841\) remainder \(4\). Thus, \(5050 \equiv 4 \mod 6\).
