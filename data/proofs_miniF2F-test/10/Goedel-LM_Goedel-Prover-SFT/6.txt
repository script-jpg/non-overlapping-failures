  To determine the modulo 6 remainder of the sum \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \dots + 98 + 99 + 100\), we first compute the sum of the first 100 natural numbers using the formula for the sum of the first \(n\) natural numbers, which is \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\). For \(n = 100\), this sum is \(\frac{100 \cdot 101}{2} = 5050\). We then find the remainder of 5050 when divided by 6.
  First, we compute the remainder of 5050 when divided by 6. We can do this by performing the division:
  \[ 5050 \div 6 = 841 \text{ remainder } 4 \]
  Thus, the remainder is 4. Therefore, the modulo 6 remainder of the sum \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + \dots + 98 + 99 + 100\) is 4.
