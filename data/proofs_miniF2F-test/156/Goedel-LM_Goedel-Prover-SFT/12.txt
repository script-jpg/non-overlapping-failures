  Given distinct positive integers \( I \), \( M \), and \( O \) such that the product \( I \cdot M \cdot O = 2001 \), we need to find the largest possible value of the sum \( I + M + O \).
  To solve this, we start by analyzing the given product \( I \cdot M \cdot O = 2001 \). Since 2001 is a product of three distinct positive integers, we can use the fact that the sum of the largest possible values of \( I \), \( M \), and \( O \) is 671. This is derived from the fact that the prime factorization of 2001 is \( 3 \times 13 \times 61 \), and the largest possible values for \( I \), \( M \), and \( O \) are 61, 61, and 3 respectively.

  -- We know that 2001 is the product of three distinct positive integers.
  have h₂ : i ≤ 61 := by
    -- Using the fact that 2001 = 3 * 13 * 61, we can deduce that i must be less than or equal to 61.
    nlinarith [h₁, h₀]
  have h₃ : m ≤ 61 := by
    -- Similarly, m must be less than or equal to 61.
    nlinarith [h₁, h₀]
  have h₄ : o ≤ 61 := by
    -- And o must be less than or equal to 61.
    nlinarith [h₁, h₀]
  -- Given the constraints, we can conclude that the sum of i, m, and o is at most 671.
  nlinarith [h₁, h₀]
