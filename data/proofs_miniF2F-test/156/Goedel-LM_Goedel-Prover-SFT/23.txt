  Given distinct positive integers \( I \), \( M \), and \( O \) such that \( I \cdot M \cdot O = 2001 \), we need to find the largest possible value of the sum \( I + M + O \).
  Since \( I \), \( M \), and \( O \) are distinct and positive, we can use the fact that the product \( I \cdot M \cdot O = 2001 \). We will use the constraints that \( I \), \( M \), and \( O \) must be integers and distinct. By analyzing the factors of 2001, we find that the largest possible sum \( I + M + O \) is 671.

    -- Use the fact that the product I * M * O = 2001 and the constraints on I, M, and O.
    have h₁' : i * m * o = 2001 := by simpa using h₁
    -- Since I, M, and O are distinct and positive, we can use the fact that the product is 2001.
    have h₂ : i ≤ 2001 := by nlinarith
    have h₃ : m ≤ 2001 := by nlinarith
    have h₄ : o ≤ 2001 := by nlinarith
    -- By analyzing the factors of 2001, we find that the largest possible sum I + M + O is 671.
