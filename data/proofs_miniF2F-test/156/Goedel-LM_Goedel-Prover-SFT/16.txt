  Given the year \(2001\), we need to find the largest possible value of the sum \(I + M + O\) where \(I\), \(M\), and \(O\) are distinct positive integers such that the product \(I \cdot M \cdot O = 2001\). We will show that the sum \(I + M + O\) is maximized when \(I = 21\), \(M = 41\), and \(O = 59\).
