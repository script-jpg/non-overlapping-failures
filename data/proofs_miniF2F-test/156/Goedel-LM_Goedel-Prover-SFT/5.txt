  Given distinct positive integers \( I \), \( M \), and \( O \) such that \( I \cdot M \cdot O = 2001 \), we need to determine the largest possible value of the sum \( I + M + O \). By examining the factors of 2001, we find that the possible values for \( I \), \( M \), and \( O \) are 1, 3, and 667 (or their permutations). Therefore, the sum \( I + M + O \) is \( 1 + 3 + 667 = 671 \).

  -- We start by assuming the distinctness of i, m, and o.
  have i_ne_m : i ≠ m := h₀.1
  have m_ne_o : m ≠ o := h₀.2.1
  have o_ne_i : o ≠ i := h₀.2.2
  -- We use the fact that the product of i, m, and o is 2001 to deduce possible values for i, m, and o.
