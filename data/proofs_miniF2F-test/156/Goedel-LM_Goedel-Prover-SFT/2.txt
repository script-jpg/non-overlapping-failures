  Given distinct positive integers \( I \), \( M \), and \( O \) such that \( I \cdot M \cdot O = 2001 \), we need to find the largest possible value of the sum \( I + M + O \).
  To solve this, we start by analyzing the prime factorization of 2001. The prime factorization of 2001 is \( 3 \times 667 \). Therefore, the possible values for \( I \), \( M \), and \( O \) are the distinct positive integers that multiply to 2001.
  We need to find the maximum sum \( I + M + O \). Since \( I \), \( M \), and \( O \) are distinct primes or their products, the maximum sum occurs when the primes are as evenly distributed as possible among the three numbers.
  Given the constraints, the maximum sum is achieved when \( I = 667 \), \( M = 3 \), and \( O = 1 \). Thus, the maximum sum is:
  \[ 667 + 3 + 1 = 671 \]
