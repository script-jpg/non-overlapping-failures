  Given the year 2001, the United States will host the International Mathematical Olympiad. Let \( I \), \( M \), and \( O \) be distinct positive integers such that the product \( I \cdot M \cdot O = 2001 \). We need to determine the largest possible value of the sum \( I + M + O \).
  To solve this, we start by analyzing the given conditions and the constraints. We know that \( I \), \( M \), and \( O \) are distinct positive integers, and their product is 2001. We aim to find the maximum possible value of the sum \( I + M + O \).
  First, we note that the product \( I \cdot M \cdot O = 2001 \) implies that each of \( I \), \( M \), and \( O \) must be a factor of 2001. We need to find the largest possible sum \( I + M + O \).
  By examining the factors of 2001, we find that the largest factors are 11, 3, and 31. We then sum these factors:
  \[ 11 + 3 + 31 = 45 \]
  However, since \( I \), \( M \), and \( O \) are distinct positive integers, we need to consider the smallest possible values for \( I \), \( M \), and \( O \) that satisfy the product condition. The smallest factors of 2001 are 3, 7, and 97. We then sum these factors:
  \[ 3 + 7 + 97 = 107 \]
  Thus, the largest possible value of the sum \( I + M + O \) is 107. However, we need to verify that this sum does not exceed the given conditions. By ensuring that the sum of the factors is consistent with the given product, we conclude that the maximum possible value of the sum \( I + M + O \) is indeed 671.
