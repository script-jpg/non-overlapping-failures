  To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given conditions. We know that \( I \cdot M \cdot O = 2001 \), where \( I \), \( M \), and \( O \) are distinct positive integers. We need to find the largest possible value of \( I + M + O \).
  Given the constraints, we can use the fact that the product of the three numbers equals 2001. We can then use the properties of prime factorization and the fact that the sum of the numbers must be a multiple of the product to derive the maximum possible sum.

  have : i * m * o = 2001 := h₁
  -- We need to show that the sum of I, M, and O is at most 671.
  have : i + m + o ≤ 671 := by
    -- We use the fact that the product of I, M, and O is 2001.
    -- We then use the properties of prime factorization and the fact that the sum of the numbers must be a multiple of the product to derive the maximum possible sum.
    -- Specifically, we use the fact that the sum of the numbers must be less than or equal to 671.

    -- If the sum of I, M, and O is greater than 671, then we can use the fact that the product of I, M, and O is 2001.
    -- This leads to a contradiction because the sum of the numbers must be a multiple of the product.
