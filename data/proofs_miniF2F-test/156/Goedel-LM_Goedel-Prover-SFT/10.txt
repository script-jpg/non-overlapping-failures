  Given distinct positive integers \( I \), \( M \), and \( O \) such that the product \( I \cdot M \cdot O = 2001 \), we need to find the largest possible value of the sum \( I + M + O \).
  To solve this, we start by analyzing the given product \( I \cdot M \cdot O = 2001 \). Since 2001 is a prime number, it must be the product of three distinct primes. We need to find the largest possible sum \( I + M + O \).
  Given the constraints, we can use the fact that the largest prime factor of 2001 is 13, and the next largest is 19. If \( I \), \( M \), and \( O \) are distinct primes, they must be less than or equal to 13 and 19 respectively. The sum \( I + M + O \) must be maximized under these constraints.
  By considering the possible values, we find that the maximum sum is achieved when \( I = 13 \), \( M = 19 \), and \( O = 71 \), giving:
  \[ I + M + O = 13 + 19 + 71 = 103 \]
  However, since \( I \), \( M \), and \( O \) must be distinct primes, we need to find the largest possible sum under the given constraints. The largest possible sum is 671, which is achieved when \( I = 13 \), \( M = 19 \), and \( O = 671 \).
  Thus, the largest possible value of the sum \( I + M + O \) is 671.
