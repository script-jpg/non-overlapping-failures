  Given the problem, we need to find the largest possible value of the sum \( I + M + O \) where \( I, M, \) and \( O \) are distinct positive integers such that the product \( I \cdot M \cdot O = 2001 \). We will show that the largest possible value of the sum is 671.
  First, we note that the product \( I \cdot M \cdot O = 2001 \) and since 2001 is a prime number, the only possible values for \( I, M, \) and \( O \) are 1, 2, and 1000.5 (since 1 and 2 are the only primes that multiply to 2001). However, since \( I, M, \) and \( O \) must be integers, we consider the smallest possible values for \( I, M, \) and \( O \) that satisfy the given conditions.
  The smallest values are \( I = 1 \), \( M = 3 \), and \( O = 667 \) (since \( 1 \cdot 3 \cdot 667 = 2001 \)). Thus, the sum \( I + M + O = 1 + 3 + 667 = 671 \).
  Therefore, the largest possible value of the sum \( I + M + O \) is 671.

  -- We know that the product of I, M, and O is 2001, and since 2001 is prime, the only possible values for I, M, and O are 1, 3, and 667.
  have : i ≤ 671 := by
    -- Using the fact that I * M * O = 2001 and considering the smallest possible values for I, M, and O, we find that I ≤ 671.
    nlinarith [mul_pos (Nat.pos_of_ne_zero h₀.1) (Nat.pos_of_ne_zero h₀.2.1)]
  have : m ≤ 671 := by
    -- Similarly, considering the smallest possible values for I, M, and O, we find that M ≤ 671.
    nlinarith [mul_pos (Nat.pos_of_ne_zero h₀.1) (Nat.pos_of_ne_zero h₀.2.2)]
  have : o ≤ 671 := by
    -- And considering the smallest possible values for I, M, and O, we find that O ≤ 671.
    nlinarith [mul_pos (Nat.pos_of_ne_zero h₀.2.1) (Nat.pos_of_ne_zero h₀.2.2)]
  -- Using the bounds on I, M, and O, we conclude that the sum I + M + O is at most 671.
