  Given the year 2001, the United States will host the International Mathematical Olympiad. Let \( I \), \( M \), and \( O \) be distinct positive integers such that the product \( I \cdot M \cdot O = 2001 \). We need to determine the largest possible value of the sum \( I + M + O \).
  First, we note that the product \( I \cdot M \cdot O = 2001 \) and the sum \( I + M + O \) must be found. We will consider the constraints on \( I \), \( M \), and \( O \) and use the fact that they are distinct and positive integers.
  By examining the prime factorization of 2001, we find that the largest possible value of the sum \( I + M + O \) is 671. This is achieved when \( I = M = O = 1 \), giving the sum \( 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \).
