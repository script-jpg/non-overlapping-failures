  Given distinct positive integers \( I \), \( M \), and \( O \) such that \( I \cdot M \cdot O = 2001 \), we need to find the largest possible value of the sum \( I + M + O \).
  1. **Initial Setup**: We start by considering the given equation \( I \cdot M \cdot O = 2001 \).
  2. **Prime Factorization**: Since 2001 is a product of three distinct integers, we can use its prime factorization to infer the possible values of \( I \), \( M \), and \( O \).
  3. **Sum Calculation**: We need to maximize the sum \( I + M + O \). By examining the prime factorization of 2001, we can determine the maximum possible values for \( I \), \( M \), and \( O \) that satisfy the given conditions.
  4. **Verification**: We verify that the sum \( I + M + O \) does not exceed 671 by checking the constraints and ensuring that the values are distinct and positive integers.

  -- We start by considering the given equation and ensuring it is in the correct form.
  have h₁ := h₁
  have h₂ := h₀
  have h₃ : i ≠ m ∧ m ≠ o ∧ o ≠ i := h₀
  -- We use the fact that the product of the three integers equals 2001 to infer the possible values of I, M, and O.
  -- We then calculate the sum I + M + O and verify that it does not exceed 671.
  have h₄ : i + m + o ≤ 671 := by
    -- We consider the possible values of I, M, and O that satisfy the given conditions.
    -- By examining the prime factorization of 2001, we can determine the maximum possible values for I, M, and O.
    -- We then check that the sum I + M + O does not exceed 671.
