  Given distinct positive integers \( I \), \( M \), and \( O \) such that \( I \cdot M \cdot O = 2001 \), we need to determine the largest possible value of the sum \( I + M + O \).
  To solve this, we start by analyzing the given conditions and the product \( I \cdot M \cdot O = 2001 \). We know that the product of three distinct integers equals 2001. We can use the fact that the sum of the integers is maximized when the integers are as small as possible, and the product constraint to find the maximum possible sum.

  -- We know that the product of three distinct integers equals 2001.
  have h : i * m * o = 2001 := h₁
  -- We use the fact that the sum of the integers is maximized when the integers are as small as possible.
  -- We will use the constraints to find the maximum possible sum.
  have h₂ : i + m + o ≤ 671 := by
    -- We use the fact that the product of the integers is 2001 to bound the sum.
    -- We will use the constraints to find the maximum possible sum.
