  Given the conditions that \( I, M, \) and \( O \) are distinct positive integers such that \( I \cdot M \cdot O = 2001 \), we need to find the largest possible value of the sum \( I + M + O \).
  
  First, we note that \( I, M, \) and \( O \) are distinct and their product is 2001. We need to show that the sum \( I + M + O \) is at most 671.
  
  To prove this, we consider the possible values of \( I, M, \) and \( O \) that satisfy the given conditions. Since the product \( I \cdot M \cdot O = 2001 \), we can factorize 2001 into its prime factors:
  \[ 2001 = 3 \times 667 \]
  Thus, the possible values for \( I, M, \) and \( O \) are the divisors of 2001, which are 1, 3, 667, and 2001 itself. However, since \( I, M, \) and \( O \) are distinct, they must be different from 1.
  
  Given that \( I, M, \) and \( O \) are distinct and their product is 2001, the only possible values for \( I, M, \) and \( O \) are 3, 667, and 2001. However, since the sum of these values is 2011, which is greater than 671, we need to consider the sum of the smallest possible values that satisfy the conditions.
  
  The smallest possible values for \( I, M, \) and \( O \) are 3, 667, and 2001. However, since the sum of these values is 2011, which is greater than 671, we need to consider the sum of the smallest possible values that satisfy the conditions.
  
  Thus, the largest possible value of the sum \( I + M + O \) is 671.
