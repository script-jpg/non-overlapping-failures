  Given distinct positive integers \( I \), \( M \), and \( O \) such that \( I \cdot M \cdot O = 2001 \), we need to determine the largest possible value of \( I + M + O \).
  First, we note that the product \( I \cdot M \cdot O = 2001 \) implies that each of \( I \), \( M \), and \( O \) must be a factor of 2001. We will show that the sum \( I + M + O \) cannot exceed 671.
  To achieve this, we consider the smallest possible values for \( I \), \( M \), and \( O \) that satisfy the given conditions. We will demonstrate that the sum of these values cannot exceed 671.
