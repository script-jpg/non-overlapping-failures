  Given distinct positive integers \( I \), \( M \), and \( O \) such that \( I \cdot M \cdot O = 2001 \), we need to find the largest possible value of \( I + M + O \). We will show that the largest possible value of \( I + M + O \) is 671.
  1. **Prime Factorization**: The number 2001 can be factored into primes as \( 2001 = 3 \times 667 \).
  2. **Distinct Positive Integers**: Since \( I \), \( M \), and \( O \) are distinct positive integers, they must be factors of 2001.
  3. **Sum Calculation**: To maximize \( I + M + O \), we consider the factors of 2001. The factors of 2001 are 1, 3, 667, and 2001.
  4. **Maximum Sum**: The maximum sum \( I + M + O \) is achieved by choosing the factors that maximize the sum. Given the distinctness and the requirement that \( I \), \( M \), and \( O \) are distinct positive integers, the maximum sum is achieved by choosing the factors 1, 3, and 667.
  5. **Verification**: The sum \( 1 + 3 + 667 = 671 \), which is the largest possible value of \( I + M + O \).

  -- We will use the fact that the product of the three numbers is 2001 and they are distinct.
  have : i + m + o ≤ 671 := by
    -- We consider the possible values of i, m, and o that are factors of 2001.
    have : i ≤ 2001 := by
      -- Since i is a factor of 2001, it must be less than or equal to 2001.
      apply Nat.le_of_dvd (by simp) h₁
    have : m ≤ 2001 := by
      -- Similarly, m is a factor of 2001, so it must be less than or equal to 2001.
      apply Nat.le_of_dvd (by simp) h₁
    have : o ≤ 2001 := by
      -- And o is a factor of 2001, so it must be less than or equal to 2001.
      apply Nat.le_of_dvd (by simp) h₁
    -- We use interval_cases to consider all possible values of i, m, and o that are distinct factors of 2001.
    interval_cases i <;> interval_cases m <;> interval_cases o <;> norm_num at h₁ <;> omega
  -- Finally, we conclude that the sum of i, m, and o is at most 671.
