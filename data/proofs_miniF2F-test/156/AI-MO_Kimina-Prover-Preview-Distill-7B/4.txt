-- First, we note that this problem is about integer partition of 2001 into 3 distinct positive integers.
  -- We need to consider the factors of 2001. 2001 = 3 * 667, 2001 = 9 * 223, and 2001 = 23 * 87.
  have hfactor : (2001 : ℕ) = 3 * 667 ∨ (2001 : ℕ) = 9 * 223 ∨ (2001 : ℕ) = 23 * 87 := by
    norm_num

  rcases hfactor with (hfactor | hfactor | hfactor)

  -- The first case, 2001 = 3 * 667, is clear.
