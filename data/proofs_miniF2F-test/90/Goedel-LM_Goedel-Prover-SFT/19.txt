  We aim to show that for any positive integer \( n \), the product \(\prod_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) \leq 3 - \frac{1}{n}\). We will use induction on \( n \) and some properties of finite products to establish this inequality.
  1. **Base Case**: When \( n = 1 \), the product is simply \( 1 + \frac{1}{1^3} = 1 + 1 = 2 \). We need to show that \( 2 \leq 3 - \frac{1}{1} \), which holds true since \( 2 \leq 2 \).
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the inequality holds for some \( n \). We need to show it holds for \( n + 1 \).
     - The product for \( n + 1 \) can be written as:
       \[
       \prod_{k=1}^{n+1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) = \prod_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{(n+1)^3}\right)
       \]
     - By the inductive hypothesis, the first part of the product is less than or equal to \( 3 - \frac{1}{n} \).
     - The second term \( \left(1 + \frac{1}{(n+1)^3}\right) \) is a positive number less than or equal to 1.
     - Therefore, the entire product is less than or equal to \( 3 - \frac{1}{n} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{(n+1)^3}\right) \).
     - Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:
       \[
       3 - \frac{1}{n} + \frac{1}{n^3} \cdot \frac{1}{n+1} = 3 - \frac{1}{n} + \frac{1}{n^4} \cdot \frac{1}{n+1}
       \]
     - Since \( \frac{1}{n^4} \cdot \frac{1}{n+1} \) is a very small number, the inequality holds.
