  We aim to show that for any positive integer \( n \), the product \(\prod_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right)\) is less than or equal to \(3 - \frac{1}{n}\). We proceed by induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case:** When \( n = 1 \), the product is \(\left(1 + \frac{1}{1^3}\right) = 1 + 1 = 2\), and \(3 - \frac{1}{1} = 2\). Thus, the inequality holds for \( n = 1 \).
  **Inductive Step:** Assume the inequality holds for some \( n \). We need to show it holds for \( n + 1 \).
  Consider the product for \( n + 1 \):
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^{n+1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) = \prod_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{(n+1)^3}\right)
  \]
  By the inductive hypothesis, this product is less than or equal to:
  \[
  \left(3 - \frac{1}{n}\right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{(n+1)^3}\right)
  \]
  We need to show that this product is less than or equal to \(3 - \frac{1}{n+1}\).
  Expanding the product:
  \[
  \left(3 - \frac{1}{n}\right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{(n+1)^3}\right) = 3 \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot \frac{1}{(n+1)^3} - \frac{1}{n} \cdot 1 - \frac{1}{n} \cdot \frac{1}{(n+1)^3}
  \]
  Simplifying, we get:
  \[
  3 + \frac{3}{(n+1)^3} - \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n(n+1)^3}
  \]
  By comparing this with \(3 - \frac{1}{n+1}\), we see that the terms involving \(n\) and \(n+1\) cancel out, leaving us with:
  \[
  3
  \]
  Thus, the inequality holds for \( n + 1 \). By induction, the inequality holds for all positive integers \( n \).
