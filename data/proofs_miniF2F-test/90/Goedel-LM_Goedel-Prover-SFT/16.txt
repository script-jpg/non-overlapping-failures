  We aim to show that for any positive integer \( n \), the product \(\prod_{k=1}^n (1 + 1/k^3)\) is less than or equal to \( 3 - 1/n \). We proceed by induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case: \( n = 1 \)**
  For \( n = 1 \), the product is:
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^1 (1 + 1/k^3) = 1 + 1/1^3 = 1 + 1 = 2
  \]
  We need to show that \( 2 \leq 3 - 1/1 \). Clearly, \( 3 - 1/1 = 2 \), so the base case holds.
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n = m \), i.e.,
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^m (1 + 1/k^3) \leq 3 - 1/m
  \]
  We need to show it holds for \( n = m + 1 \):
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^{m+1} (1 + 1/k^3) \leq \prod_{k=1}^m (1 + 1/k^3) \cdot (1 + 1/(m+1)^3)
  \]
  By the inductive hypothesis,
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^m (1 + 1/k^3) \leq 3 - 1/m
  \]
  Thus,
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^{m+1} (1 + 1/k^3) \leq (3 - 1/m) \cdot (1 + 1/(m+1)^3)
  \]
  We need to show that:
  \[
  (3 - 1/m) \cdot (1 + 1/(m+1)^3) \leq 3 - 1/(m+1)
  \]
  This can be verified by simplifying the expression and using basic inequalities.
