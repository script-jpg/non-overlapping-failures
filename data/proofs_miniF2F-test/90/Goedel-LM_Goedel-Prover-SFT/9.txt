  We aim to show that for any positive integer \( n \), the product \(\prod_{k=1}^n (1 + 1/k^3)\) is less than or equal to \(3 - 1/n\). We will use induction on \(n\) to prove this statement.
  1. **Base Case**: When \(n = 1\), the product is \(\prod_{k=1}^1 (1 + 1/k^3) = 1 + 1/1^3 = 1 + 1 = 2\). We need to show that \(2 \leq 3 - 1/1 = 2\), which is true.
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds for some \(n = m\), i.e., \(\prod_{k=1}^m (1 + 1/k^3) \leq 3 - 1/m\). We need to show it holds for \(n = m + 1\).
     - The product for \(n = m + 1\) can be written as \(\prod_{k=1}^{m+1} (1 + 1/k^3) = \prod_{k=1}^m (1 + 1/k^3) \cdot (1 + 1/(m+1)^3)\).
     - By the inductive hypothesis, \(\prod_{k=1}^m (1 + 1/k^3) \leq 3 - 1/m\).
     - We need to show that \((3 - 1/m) \cdot (1 + 1/(m+1)^3) \leq 3 - 1/(m+1)\).
     - Simplifying, we get \((3 - 1/m) \cdot (1 + 1/(m+1)^3) = 3 - 1/m + 1/(m+1)^3 - 1/(m+1) = 3 - 1/(m+1) - 1/(m+1)^3\).
     - Since \(-1/(m+1) - 1/(m+1)^3 \leq 0\), the inequality holds.
  Thus, by induction, the statement is true for all positive integers \(n\).
