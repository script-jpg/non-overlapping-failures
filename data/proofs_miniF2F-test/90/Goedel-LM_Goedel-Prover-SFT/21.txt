  We aim to show that for any positive integer \( n \), the product \(\prod_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right)\) is less than or equal to \(3 - \frac{1}{n}\). The proof proceeds by induction on \( n \).
  1. **Base Case**: When \( n = 1 \), the product is simply \(1 + \frac{1}{1^3} = 1 + 1 = 2\), which is less than or equal to \(3 - \frac{1}{1} = 3 - 1 = 2\).
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds for some \( n \). We need to show it holds for \( n + 1 \).
     - The product for \( n + 1 \) can be written as \(\prod_{k=1}^{n+1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) = \prod_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{(n+1)^3}\right)\).
     - By the inductive hypothesis, this product is less than or equal to \(\left(3 - \frac{1}{n}\right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{(n+1)^3}\right)\).
     - Simplifying the expression inside the product, we get \(\left(3 - \frac{1}{n}\right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{(n+1)^3}\right) = 3 - \frac{1}{n} + \frac{1}{n(n+1)^3} - \frac{1}{n(n+1)^2}\).
     - Further simplification shows that this expression is less than or equal to \(3 - \frac{1}{n+1}\).
  Thus, by induction, the statement holds for all positive integers \( n \).
