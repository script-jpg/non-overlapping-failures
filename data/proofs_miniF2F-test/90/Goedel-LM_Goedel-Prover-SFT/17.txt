  We aim to show that for any positive integer \( n \), the product \(\prod_{k=1}^n (1 + 1/k^3)\) is less than or equal to \(3 - 1/n\). We will use induction on \( n \) and some properties of finite products to establish this result.
  1. **Base Case**: When \( n = 1 \), the product is simply \(1 + 1/1^3 = 1 + 1 = 2\), which is less than or equal to \(3 - 1/1 = 2\).
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds for some \( n \). We need to show it holds for \( n + 1 \).
     - For \( n = 1 \), the product is \(2\), which is less than or equal to \(3 - 1/1 = 2\).
     - For \( n > 1 \), we use the fact that \(\prod_{k=1}^{n+1} (1 + 1/k^3)\) can be split into \(\prod_{k=1}^n (1 + 1/k^3) \cdot (1 + 1/(n+1)^3)\). By the inductive hypothesis, this product is less than or equal to \(2 \cdot (1 + 1/(n+1)^3)\). We need to show that this is less than or equal to \(3 - 1/(n+1)\).
