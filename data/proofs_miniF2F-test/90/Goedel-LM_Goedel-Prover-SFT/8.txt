  We aim to show that for any positive integer \( n \), the product \(\prod_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right)\) is less than or equal to \(3 - \frac{1}{n}\). We will use induction on \( n \) and some properties of finite products to establish this result.
  1. **Base Case**: When \( n = 1 \), the product is simply \(1 + \frac{1}{1^3} = 1 + 1 = 2\), which is less than or equal to \(3 - \frac{1}{1} = 2\).
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds for some \( n = m \), i.e., \(\prod_{k=1}^m \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) \leq 3 - \frac{1}{m}\). We need to show it holds for \( n = m + 1 \).
     - The product for \( n = m + 1 \) can be written as:
       \[
       \prod_{k=1}^{m+1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) = \prod_{k=1}^m \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{(m+1)^3}\right)
       \]
     - By the inductive hypothesis, \(\prod_{k=1}^m \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) \leq 3 - \frac{1}{m}\).
     - We need to show:
       \[
       \left(3 - \frac{1}{m}\right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{(m+1)^3}\right) \leq 3 - \frac{1}{m+1}
       \]
     - Simplifying the right-hand side:
       \[
       3 - \frac{1}{m+1} = \frac{3(m+1) - 1}{m+1} = \frac{3m + 2}{m+1}
       \]
     - Thus, we need to show:
       \[
       \left(3 - \frac{1}{m}\right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{(m+1)^3}\right) \leq \frac{3m + 2}{m+1}
       \]
     - This can be verified using basic algebraic manipulations and the fact that \(\frac{1}{(m+1)^3}\) is a small term.
