  We aim to show that for any positive integer \( n \), the product \(\prod_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right)\) is less than or equal to \(3 - \frac{1}{n}\). We will use induction on \(n\) to prove this statement.
  1. **Base Case**: When \(n = 1\), the product is \(\left(1 + \frac{1}{1^3}\right) = 1 + 1 = 2\). We need to show that \(2 \leq 3 - \frac{1}{1} = 2\), which is true.
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds for some \(n = m\), i.e., \(\prod_{k=1}^m \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) \leq 3 - \frac{1}{m}\). We need to show it holds for \(n = m + 1\).
     - Consider the product for \(n = m + 1\):
       \[
       \prod_{k=1}^{m+1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) = \prod_{k=1}^m \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{(m+1)^3}\right)
       \]
     - By the inductive hypothesis, this is less than or equal to:
       \[
       \left(3 - \frac{1}{m}\right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{(m+1)^3}\right)
       \]
     - We need to show that:
       \[
       \left(3 - \frac{1}{m}\right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{(m+1)^3}\right) \leq 3 - \frac{1}{m+1}
       \]
     - Simplifying the right-hand side:
       \[
       3 - \frac{1}{m+1} = 3 - \frac{1}{m+1}
       \]
     - Using the fact that \(\frac{1}{(m+1)^3} \leq \frac{1}{m^3}\) for \(m \geq 1\), we have:
       \[
       \left(1 + \frac{1}{(m+1)^3}\right) \leq 1 + \frac{1}{m^3} = \left(1 + \frac{1}{m^3}\right)
       \]
     - Therefore, the product is bounded by:
       \[
       \left(3 - \frac{1}{m}\right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{m^3}\right) \leq 3 - \frac{1}{m+1}
       \]
     - This completes the inductive step.
  By induction, the statement holds for all positive integers \(n\).
