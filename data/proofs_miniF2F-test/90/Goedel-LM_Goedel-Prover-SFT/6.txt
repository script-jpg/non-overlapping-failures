  We aim to show that for any positive integer \( n \), the product \(\prod_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right)\) is less than or equal to \( 3 - \frac{1}{n} \). We will use induction on \( n \) and some properties of finite products and inequalities.
  1. **Base Case**: When \( n = 1 \), the product is \(\left(1 + \frac{1}{1^3}\right) = 1 + 1 = 2\). Clearly, \( 2 \leq 3 - \frac{1}{1} = 3 - 1 = 2 \).
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds for some \( n \). We need to show it holds for \( n + 1 \).
     - For \( n = 1 \), the product is \( 2 \), which is less than \( 3 - \frac{1}{1} = 2 \).
     - For \( n > 1 \), we use the fact that \(\prod_{k=1}^{n+1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) = \prod_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{(n+1)^3}\right)\).
     - By the inductive hypothesis, \(\prod_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) \leq 3 - \frac{1}{n}\).
     - We need to show that \(\left(1 + \frac{1}{n+1}\right) \leq 3 - \frac{1}{n+1}\).
     - This simplifies to \(\frac{1}{n+1} \leq \frac{1}{n+1}\), which is trivially true.
  By induction, the statement holds for all positive integers \( n \).
