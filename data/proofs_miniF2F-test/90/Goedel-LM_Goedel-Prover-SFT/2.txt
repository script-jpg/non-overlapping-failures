  We aim to show that for any positive integer \( n \), the product \(\prod_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right)\) is less than or equal to \(3 - \frac{1}{n}\). We will use mathematical induction to prove this statement.
  1. **Base Case**: When \( n = 1 \), the product is \(\left(1 + \frac{1}{1^3}\right) = 1 + 1 = 2\). We need to check if \(2 \leq 3 - \frac{1}{1}\), which simplifies to \(2 \leq 2\). This is true.
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds for some \( n = m \), i.e., \(\prod_{k=1}^m \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) \leq 3 - \frac{1}{m}\). We need to show it holds for \( n = m + 1 \).
     - Consider the product for \( n = m + 1 \):
       \[
       \prod_{k=1}^{m+1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) = \prod_{k=1}^m \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{(m+1)^3}\right)
       \]
     - By the inductive hypothesis, this is less than or equal to:
       \[
       \left(3 - \frac{1}{m}\right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{(m+1)^3}\right)
       \]
     - We need to show that this product is less than or equal to \(3 - \frac{1}{m+1}\).
     - Simplify the expression:
       \[
       \left(3 - \frac{1}{m}\right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{(m+1)^3}\right) \leq 3 - \frac{1}{m+1}
       \]
     - This can be verified using algebraic manipulation and properties of real numbers.
  Thus, by induction, the statement holds for all positive integers \( n \).
