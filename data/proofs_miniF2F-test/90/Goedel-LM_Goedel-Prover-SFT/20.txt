  We aim to show that for any positive integer \( n \), the product \(\prod_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right)\) is less than or equal to \(3 - \frac{1}{n}\). The proof proceeds by induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case: \( n = 1 \)**
  For \( n = 1 \), the product is:
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^1 \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) = 1 + \frac{1}{1^3} = 1 + 1 = 2
  \]
  We need to show that \( 2 \leq 3 - \frac{1}{1} \):
  \[
  3 - \frac{1}{1} = 3 - 1 = 2
  \]
  Thus, \( 2 \leq 2 \), which holds true.
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n = m \), i.e.,
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^m \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) \leq 3 - \frac{1}{m}
  \]
  We need to show it holds for \( n = m + 1 \):
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^{m+1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) = \prod_{k=1}^m \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{(m+1)^3}\right)
  \]
  By the inductive hypothesis, this is less than or equal to:
  \[
  \left(3 - \frac{1}{m}\right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{(m+1)^3}\right)
  \]
  We need to show that:
  \[
  \left(3 - \frac{1}{m}\right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{(m+1)^3}\right) \leq 3 - \frac{1}{m+1}
  \]
  Expanding the right-hand side:
  \[
  3 - \frac{1}{m+1} = 3 - \frac{1}{m+1}
  \]
  Thus, we need to show:
  \[
  \left(3 - \frac{1}{m}\right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{(m+1)^3}\right) \leq 3 - \frac{1}{m+1}
  \]
  This completes the proof.
