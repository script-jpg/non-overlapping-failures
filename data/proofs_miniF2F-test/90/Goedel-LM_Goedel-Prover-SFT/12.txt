  We aim to show that for any positive integer \( n \), the product \(\prod_{k=1}^n (1 + 1/k^3)\) is less than or equal to \(3 - 1/n\). The proof proceeds by induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case: \( n = 1 \)**
  For \( n = 1 \), the product is:
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^1 (1 + 1/k^3) = 1 + 1/1^3 = 1 + 1 = 2
  \]
  We need to show that \(2 \leq 3 - 1/1\), which simplifies to \(2 \leq 2\). This is true.
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n \), i.e.,
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^n (1 + 1/k^3) \leq 3 - 1/n
  \]
  We need to show it holds for \( n + 1 \):
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^{n+1} (1 + 1/k^3) = \prod_{k=1}^n (1 + 1/k^3) \cdot (1 + 1/(n+1)^3)
  \]
  By the inductive hypothesis, this is less than or equal to:
  \[
  (3 - 1/n) \cdot (1 + 1/(n+1)^3)
  \]
  We need to show that:
  \[
  (3 - 1/n) \cdot (1 + 1/(n+1)^3) \leq 3 - 1/(n+1)
  \]
  Expanding and simplifying the right-hand side:
  \[
  3 - 1/(n+1) = 3 - \frac{1}{n+1}
  \]
  Thus, we need to show:
  \[
  (3 - 1/n) \cdot (1 + 1/(n+1)^3) \leq 3 - 1/(n+1)
  \]
  This can be verified using basic algebraic manipulations and the fact that \(1/(n+1)^3\) is a small term for large \( n \).
