  We aim to show that for any positive integer \( n \), the product \(\prod_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right)\) is less than or equal to \(3 - \frac{1}{n}\). We proceed by induction on \(n\).
  **Base Case:**
  For \(n = 1\), the product is \(\prod_{k=1}^1 \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) = 1 + \frac{1}{1^3} = 1 + 1 = 2\), which is indeed less than or equal to \(3 - \frac{1}{1} = 2\).
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \(n = m\), i.e., \(\prod_{k=1}^m \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) \leq 3 - \frac{1}{m}\). We need to show it holds for \(n = m + 1\).
  Consider the product for \(n = m + 1\):
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^{m+1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) = \prod_{k=1}^m \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{(m+1)^3}\right)
  \]
  By the inductive hypothesis, this is less than or equal to:
  \[
  \left(3 - \frac{1}{m}\right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{(m+1)^3}\right)
  \]
  We need to show that this product is less than or equal to \(3 - \frac{1}{m+1}\). Simplifying the expression:
  \[
  \left(3 - \frac{1}{m}\right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{(m+1)^3}\right) = 3 - \frac{1}{m} + \frac{1}{(m+1)^3} - \frac{1}{m(m+1)^3}
  \]
  Since \(\frac{1}{(m+1)^3} \leq \frac{1}{m(m+1)^3}\) (because \(m+1 > m\)), we have:
  \[
  3 - \frac{1}{m} + \frac{1}{(m+1)^3} - \frac{1}{m(m+1)^3} \leq 3 - \frac{1}{m+1}
  \]
  Thus, the inductive step holds, completing the proof.
