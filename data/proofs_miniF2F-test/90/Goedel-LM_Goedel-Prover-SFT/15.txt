  We aim to show that for any positive integer \( n \), the product \(\prod_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right)\) is less than or equal to \(3 - \frac{1}{n}\). The proof proceeds by induction on \( n \).
  **Base Case:**
  For \( n = 1 \), the product is \(\left(1 + \frac{1}{1^3}\right) = 1 + 1 = 2\). We need to show \(2 \leq 3 - \frac{1}{1} = 3 - 1 = 2\). This is trivially true.
  **Inductive Step:**
  Assume the statement holds for some \( n = m \), i.e., \(\prod_{k=1}^m \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) \leq 3 - \frac{1}{m}\). We need to show it holds for \( n = m + 1 \).
  Consider the product for \( n = m + 1 \):
  \[
  \prod_{k=1}^{m+1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) = \prod_{k=1}^m \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{(m+1)^3}\right)
  \]
  By the inductive hypothesis, this is less than or equal to:
  \[
  \left(3 - \frac{1}{m}\right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{(m+1)^3}\right)
  \]
  We need to show this product is less than or equal to \(3 - \frac{1}{m+1}\). Expanding and simplifying the expression:
  \[
  \left(3 - \frac{1}{m}\right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{(m+1)^3}\right) = 3 - \frac{1}{m} + \frac{1}{m(m+1)^3}
  \]
  Since \(\frac{1}{m(m+1)^3}\) is a positive term, the product is less than or equal to \(3 - \frac{1}{m+1}\).
  Thus, by induction, the statement holds for all positive integers \( n \).
