  We aim to show that for any positive integer \( n \), the product \(\prod_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) \leq 3 - \frac{1}{n}\). We will use mathematical induction to establish this result.
  1. **Base Case**: When \( n = 1 \), the product is \( 1 + \frac{1}{1^3} = 1 + 1 = 2 \), which is less than \( 3 - \frac{1}{1} = 3 - 1 = 2 \). Thus, the base case holds.
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds for some positive integer \( n \), i.e., \(\prod_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) \leq 3 - \frac{1}{n}\). We need to show it holds for \( n + 1 \).
     - Consider the product for \( n + 1 \):
       \[
       \prod_{k=1}^{n+1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) = \prod_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{(n+1)^3}\right)
       \]
     - By the inductive hypothesis, the first part of the product is less than or equal to \( 3 - \frac{1}{n} \).
     - The second part, \( \left(1 + \frac{1}{(n+1)^3}\right) \), is a positive fraction and thus does not affect the overall inequality.
     - Combining these, we get:
       \[
       \prod_{k=1}^{n+1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) \leq \left(3 - \frac{1}{n}\right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{(n+1)^3}\right)
       \]
     - Simplifying the right-hand side:
       \[
       \left(3 - \frac{1}{n}\right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{(n+1)^3}\right) = 3 - \frac{1}{n} + \frac{1}{n(n+1)^3}
       \]
     - Since \(\frac{1}{n(n+1)^3}\) is a positive fraction, the inequality holds.
  Thus, by induction, the statement is true for all positive integers \( n \).
