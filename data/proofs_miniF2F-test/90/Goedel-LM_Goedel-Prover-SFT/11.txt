  We aim to show that for any positive integer \( n \), the product \(\prod_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) \leq 3 - \frac{1}{n}\). We will use induction on \( n \) and some properties of finite products to establish this result.
  1. **Base Case**: When \( n = 1 \), the product is simply \( 1 + \frac{1}{1^3} = 1 + 1 = 2 \). We need to show \( 2 \leq 3 - \frac{1}{1} = 3 - 1 = 2 \), which is true.
  2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds for some \( n \). We need to show it holds for \( n + 1 \).
     - For \( n = 1 \), the product is \( 1 + \frac{1}{1^3} = 1 + 1 = 2 \), which is less than \( 3 - \frac{1}{1} = 3 - 1 = 2 \).
     - For \( n > 1 \), we use the fact that \(\prod_{k=1}^{n+1} \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) = \prod_{k=1}^n \left(1 + \frac{1}{k^3}\right) \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{(n+1)^3} \right)\). By the inductive hypothesis, this product is less than \( 3 - \frac{1}{n} \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1}{(n+1)^3} \right) \).
     - Simplifying the right-hand side, we get \( 3 - \frac{1}{n} + \frac{1}{n^3} \cdot \frac{1}{n+1} = 3 - \frac{1}{n} + \frac{1}{n^4} \cdot \frac{1}{n+1} \), which is less than \( 3 - \frac{1}{n+1} \).
  Thus, by induction, the statement holds for all positive integers \( n \).
