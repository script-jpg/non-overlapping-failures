 Given \( P = 2^m \) and \( Q = 3^n \), we need to show that \( P^{2n} \cdot Q^m = 12^{mn} \) for any integers \( m \) and \( n \). We start by expressing \( 12^{mn} \) in terms of powers of 2 and 3. We know that \( 12 = 2^2 \cdot 3 \), so \( 12^{mn} = (2^2 \cdot 3)^{mn} = 2^{2mn} \cdot 3^{mn} \). Using the properties of exponents, we can rewrite this as \( 2^{2mn} \cdot 3^{mn} = 2^{2n} \cdot 3^m \). Since \( 2^m = P \) and \( 3^n = Q \), we substitute these into the equation to get \( P^{2n} \cdot Q^m \). Thus, we have shown that \( P^{2n} \cdot Q^m = 12^{mn} \).
