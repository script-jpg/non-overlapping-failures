  Given \( P = 2^m \) and \( Q = 3^n \), we need to show that \( 12^{mn} \) is equal to \( P^{2n} Q^m \). We start by expressing \( 12 \) as a product of its prime factors, \( 12 = 2^2 \cdot 3 \). Then, we use the properties of exponents to rewrite \( 12^{mn} \) in terms of \( P \) and \( Q \). Specifically, we use the fact that \( (a \cdot b)^c = a^c \cdot b^c \) and \( (a^b)^c = a^{bc} \). Applying these properties, we get:
  \[
  12^{mn} = (2^2 \cdot 3)^{mn} = (2^2)^{mn} \cdot 3^{mn} = 2^{2mn} \cdot 3^{mn}
  \]
  Next, we recognize that \( 2^{2mn} \cdot 3^{mn} \) can be rewritten using the properties of exponents:
  \[
  2^{2mn} \cdot 3^{mn} = 2^{2mn} \cdot 3^{mn} = 2^{2n} \cdot 2^m \cdot 3^n \cdot 3^m = 2^{2n} \cdot 2^m \cdot 3^{n+m}
  \]
  Since \( 2^m \cdot 3^n \) is equal to \( P \), we have:
  \[
  2^{2n} \cdot 2^m \cdot 3^{n+m} = 2^{2n} \cdot P \cdot Q^m
  \]
  Thus, we have shown that \( 12^{mn} = P^{2n} Q^m \).
