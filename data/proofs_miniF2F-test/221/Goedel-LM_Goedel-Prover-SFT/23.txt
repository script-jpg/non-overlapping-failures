 Given \( P = 2^m \) and \( Q = 3^n \), we need to show that \( 12^{mn} \) is equal to \( P^{2n} Q^m \) for any integers \( m \) and \( n \).
  First, express \( 12 \) as a product of its prime factors: \( 12 = 2^2 \times 3 \). Therefore, \( 12^{mn} \) can be written as \( (2^2 \times 3)^{mn} \). Using the properties of exponents, this simplifies to \( 2^{2mn} \times 3^{mn} \).
  Next, consider the expression \( P^{2n} Q^m \). Substituting \( P = 2^m \) and \( Q = 3^n \), we get \( (2^m)^{2n} \times (3^n)^m \). Using the properties of exponents, this simplifies to \( 2^{2mn} \times 3^{mn} \).
  Thus, we have shown that \( 12^{mn} = 2^{2mn} \times 3^{mn} \) and \( P^{2n} Q^m = 2^{2mn} \times 3^{mn} \). Therefore, \( 12^{mn} = P^{2n} Q^m \).
