  Given \( P = 2^m \) and \( Q = 3^n \), we need to show that \( 12^{mn} \) is equal to \( P^{2n} Q^m \).
  First, we express \( 12 \) as a product of its prime factors: \( 12 = 2^2 \times 3 \). Then, we use the properties of exponents to rewrite \( 12^{mn} \) in terms of \( P \) and \( Q \).
  Since \( 12 = 2^2 \times 3 \), we have:
  \[ 12^{mn} = (2^2 \times 3)^{mn} \]
  Using the power of a product rule, we get:
  \[ (2^2 \times 3)^{mn} = (2^2)^{mn} \times 3^{mn} \]
  Next, we apply the power of a power rule:
  \[ (2^2)^{mn} = 2^{2mn} \]
  Thus, we have:
  \[ 12^{mn} = 2^{2mn} \times 3^{mn} \]
  Now, we use the given definitions \( P = 2^m \) and \( Q = 3^n \):
  \[ 2^{2mn} = P^{2n} \]
  \[ 3^{mn} = Q^m \]
  Therefore, we can rewrite \( 12^{mn} \) as:
  \[ 12^{mn} = P^{2n} \times Q^m \]
  This completes the proof.
