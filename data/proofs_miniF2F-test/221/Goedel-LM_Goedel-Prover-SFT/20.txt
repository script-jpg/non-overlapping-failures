 Given \( P = 2^m \) and \( Q = 3^n \), we need to show that \( 12^{mn} \) is equal to \( P^{2n} Q^m \). We start by expressing \( 12 \) as a product of its prime factors, \( 12 = 2^2 \times 3 \). Then, we use the properties of exponents to rewrite \( 12^{mn} \) in terms of \( P \) and \( Q \). Specifically, we use the fact that \( (a \times b)^c = a^c \times b^c \) and the distributive property of exponents over multiplication. Finally, we simplify the expression to show that it matches \( P^{2n} Q^m \).
