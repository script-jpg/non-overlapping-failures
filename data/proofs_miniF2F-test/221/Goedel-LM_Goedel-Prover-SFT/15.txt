  Given \( P = 2^m \) and \( Q = 3^n \), we need to show that \( 12^{mn} \) is equal to \( P^{2n} Q^m \) for any integers \( m \) and \( n \).
  1. Start by expressing \( 12 \) as a product of its prime factors: \( 12 = 2^2 \cdot 3 \).
  2. Rewrite \( 12^{mn} \) as \( (2^2 \cdot 3)^{mn} \).
  3. Apply the power of a product rule to get \( (2^2)^{mn} \cdot 3^{mn} \).
  4. Simplify the powers of 2: \( 2^{2mn} \cdot 3^{mn} \).
  5. Recognize that \( 2^{2mn} \cdot 3^{mn} \) can be rewritten as \( (2^m)^{2n} \cdot 3^m \).
  6. Substitute \( P = 2^m \) and \( Q = 3^n \) into the expression to get \( P^{2n} \cdot Q^m \).
  Thus, we have shown that \( 12^{mn} = P^{2n} \cdot Q^m \).
