  Given \( P = 2^m \) and \( Q = 3^n \), we need to show that \( 12^{mn} \) is equal to \( P^{2n} Q^m \) for any integers \( m \) and \( n \).
  First, we express \( 12 \) as a product of its prime factors:
  \[ 12 = 2^2 \times 3 \]
  Next, we use the properties of exponents to rewrite \( 12^{mn} \) in terms of \( P \) and \( Q \):
  \[ 12^{mn} = (2^2 \times 3)^{mn} \]
  Applying the power of a product rule:
  \[ (2^2 \times 3)^{mn} = 2^{2mn} \times 3^{mn} \]
  We then express \( 2^{2mn} \) and \( 3^{mn} \) in terms of \( P \) and \( Q \):
  \[ 2^{2mn} = (2^m)^{2n} = P^{2n} \]
  \[ 3^{mn} = (3^n)^m = Q^m \]
  Combining these results:
  \[ 2^{2mn} \times 3^{mn} = P^{2n} \times Q^m \]
  Thus, we have shown that:
  \[ 12^{mn} = P^{2n} Q^m \]
