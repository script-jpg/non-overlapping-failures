  Given \( P = 2^m \) and \( Q = 3^n \), we need to show that \( 12^{mn} \) is equal to \( P^{2n} Q^m \). We start by expressing 12 as a product of its prime factors: \( 12 = 2^2 \times 3 \). Then, we rewrite \( 12^{mn} \) as \( (2^2 \times 3)^{mn} \). Using the power of a product rule, this becomes \( 2^{2mn} \times 3^{mn} \). Since \( P = 2^m \) and \( Q = 3^n \), we can rewrite the expression as \( P^{2n} Q^m \). This completes the proof.
