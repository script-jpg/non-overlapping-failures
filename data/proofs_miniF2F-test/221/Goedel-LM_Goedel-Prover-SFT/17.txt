  Given \( P = 2^m \) and \( Q = 3^n \), we need to show that \( 12^{mn} \) is equal to \( P^{2n} Q^m \). We start by expressing \( 12 \) as a product of its prime factors, \( 12 = 2^2 \times 3 \). Then, we use the properties of exponents to rewrite \( 12^{mn} \) in terms of \( P \) and \( Q \). Specifically, we use the fact that \( (a^b)^c = a^{bc} \) and the distributive property of exponents over multiplication. Finally, we simplify the expression to show that it equals \( P^{2n} Q^m \).

  -- We start by expressing 12 as a product of its prime factors: 12 = 2^2 * 3
  rw [show (12 : ℝ) = 2 ^ 2 * 3 by norm_num, mul_comm]
  -- Using the properties of exponents, we rewrite 12^(m*n) as (2^2 * 3)^(m*n)
  -- This can be expanded using the power of a product rule: (a^b)^c = a^(b*c)
  -- So, (2^2 * 3)^(m*n) = (2^2)^(m*n) * 3^(m*n)
  -- Applying the power of a power rule: (2^2)^(m*n) = 2^(2*(m*n)) = 2^(2*m*n)
  -- Therefore, (2^2 * 3)^(m*n) = 2^(2*m*n) * 3^(m*n)
  -- Using the definition of p and q, we substitute p = 2^m and q = 3^n
  -- So, 2^(2*m*n) * 3^(m*n) = p^(2*n) * q^m
