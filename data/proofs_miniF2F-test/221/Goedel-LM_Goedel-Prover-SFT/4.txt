  Given \( P = 2^m \) and \( Q = 3^n \), we need to show that \( 12^{mn} \) is equal to \( P^n Q^m \). We start by expressing \( 12 \) as a product of its prime factors, \( 12 = 2^2 \times 3 \). Then, we use the properties of exponents to rewrite \( 12^{mn} \) in terms of \( P \) and \( Q \). Specifically, we use the fact that \( (ab)^c = a^c b^c \) and the distributive property of exponents over multiplication. Finally, we simplify the expression to show that it equals \( P^n Q^m \).

  -- Express 12 as 2^2 * 3
  rw [show 12 = 2 ^ 2 * 3 by norm_num, mul_pow]
  -- Simplify the expression using the given definitions of p and q
  simp only [h₀, h₁, mul_pow, pow_mul, pow_two]
  -- Use the ring tactic to simplify the expression and show it equals p^n * q^m
