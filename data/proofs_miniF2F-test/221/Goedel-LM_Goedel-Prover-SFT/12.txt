  Given \( P = 2^m \) and \( Q = 3^n \), we need to show that \( 12^{mn} \) is equal to \( P^{2n} Q^m \) for any integers \( m \) and \( n \). We start by expressing \( 12 \) as a product of its prime factors, \( 12 = 2^2 \times 3 \). Then, we rewrite \( 12^{mn} \) as \( (2^2 \times 3)^{mn} \). Using the power of a product rule, this becomes \( (2^2)^{mn} \times 3^{mn} \), which simplifies to \( 2^{2mn} \times 3^{mn} \). Finally, we use the properties of exponents to combine these results to get \( 2^{2mn} \times 3^{mn} = (2^m)^{2n} \times (3^n)^m \), confirming that \( 12^{mn} = P^{2n} Q^m \).
