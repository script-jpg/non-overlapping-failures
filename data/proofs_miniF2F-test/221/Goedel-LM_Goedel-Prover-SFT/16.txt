 Given \( P = 2^m \) and \( Q = 3^n \), we need to show that \( 12^{mn} \) is equal to \( P^{2n} Q^m \).
  First, express \( 12 \) as a product of its prime factors: \( 12 = 2^2 \times 3 \). Then, compute \( 12^{mn} \) as follows:
  \[ 12^{mn} = (2^2 \times 3)^{mn} = 2^{2mn} \times 3^{mn} \]
  Next, express \( P \) and \( Q \) in terms of their definitions:
  \[ P = 2^m \]
  \[ Q = 3^n \]
  Now, compute \( P^{2n} Q^m \):
  \[ P^{2n} Q^m = (2^m)^{2n} (3^n)^m = 2^{2mn} 3^{mn} \]
  Since both expressions are equal to \( 2^{2mn} \times 3^{mn} \), we conclude that:
  \[ 12^{mn} = P^{2n} Q^m \]
