  Given \( P = 2^m \) and \( Q = 3^n \), we need to show that \( 12^{mn} \) is equal to \( P^{2n} \cdot Q^m \).
  1. Substitute \( P = 2^m \) and \( Q = 3^n \) into the expression.
  2. Simplify the expression using properties of exponents.
  3. Recognize that \( 12 = 2^2 \cdot 3 \), and thus \( 12^{mn} = (2^2 \cdot 3)^{mn} \).
  4. Apply the power of a product rule to get \( (2^2)^{mn} \cdot 3^{mn} \).
  5. Simplify \( (2^2)^{mn} \) to \( 2^{2mn} \).
  6. Combine the exponents to get \( 2^{2mn} \cdot 3^{mn} \).
  7. Recognize that \( 2^{2mn} \cdot 3^{mn} = (2^m \cdot 3^n)^{2n} \).
  8. Substitute \( 2^m \cdot 3^n \) for \( P \) and \( Q \), and use the fact that \( p = 2^m \) and \( q = 3^n \).
  9. Simplify the expression to \( P^{2n} \cdot Q^m \).
