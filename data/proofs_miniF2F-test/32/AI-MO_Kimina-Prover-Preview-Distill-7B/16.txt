-- A positive integer $X$ is 2 more than a multiple of 3.
  -- Its units digit is the same as the units digit of a number that is 4 more than a multiple of 5.
  -- What is the smallest possible value of $X$? Show that it is 14.

  have h₃ : x % 10 = 4 := by
    have : y % 10 = 4 := by omega
    rw [←this]
    exact h₂

  have h₄ : x = 14 := by omega
