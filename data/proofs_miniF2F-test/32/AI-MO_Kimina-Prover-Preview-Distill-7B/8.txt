    have : y % 10 = 4 := by omega
    rw [← h₂, this]

```

The proof starts by establishing that $x \equiv 4 \pmod{10}$, since $x$ and $y$ have the same units digit, and $y \equiv 4 \pmod{5}$. The units digit of $x$ is 4, meaning $x = 10k + 4$ for some integer $k$.

Now, we need to find the smallest such $x$ that also satisfies $x \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$. Substituting $x = 10k + 4$ into this congruence:

$10k + 4 \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$

Since $10 \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$, this simplifies to:

$k + 4 \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$

Which gives $k \equiv -2 \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$. The smallest such $k$ is $k = 1$, leading to $x = 10(1) + 4 = 14$.

Therefore, the smallest possible value of $X$ is 14.

# Solving the Number Theory Problem in Lean 4

I'm going to formalize the proof of finding the smallest positive integer $X$ that satisfies the following conditions:
1. $X$ is 2 more than a multiple of 3 ($X \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$)
2. The units digit of $X$ is the same as the units digit of a number that is 4 more than a multiple of 5

Let's begin by setting up the basic structure of our proof:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

First, I've imported the necessary libraries and set up the basic framework. The `maxHeartbeats` setting is increased to allow more computation time for Lean's automated tactics.

Now, let's define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_559 (x y : ℕ) (h₀ : x % 3 = 2) (h₁ : y % 5 = 4) (h₂ : x % 10 = y % 10) :
    14 ≤ x := by
```

I've declared the theorem with:
- `x` representing the number we're trying to find
- `y` representing a number with the same units digit as `x` that is 4 more than a multiple of 5
- `h₀` formalizing that $x \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$
- `h₁` formalizing that $y \equiv 4 \pmod{5}$
- `h₂` formalizing that $x$ and $y$ have the same units digit

Now, let's determine the units digit of $x$. Since $y \equiv 4 \pmod{5}$, its units digit is 4. Therefore, $x \equiv 4 \pmod{10}$.

```tactics
have h₃ : x % 10 = 4 := by
  have : y % 10 = 4 := by omega
  rw [← h₂, this]
```

I've proved that $x \equiv 4 \pmod{10}$ by using the fact that $y \equiv 4 \pmod{5}$, which implies $y \equiv 4 \pmod{10}$, and then using the equality of units digits to conclude.

Now we need to find the smallest $x$ satisfying both $x \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$ and $x \equiv 4 \pmod{10}$. 

To solve this, we can check numbers that are 4 more than a multiple of 10, and see which is the smallest such number that is also 2 more than a multiple of 3:
- $x = 4$: $4 \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$ (not valid)
- $x = 14$: $14 \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$ (valid)

So $x = 14$ is the smallest possible value. Let's complete the proof:

```tactics
omega
```

The `omega` tactic is powerful enough to solve integer arithmetic goals. It can deduce that if $x \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$ and $x \equiv 4 \pmod{10}$, then $x \geq 14$.

Therefore, the smallest possible value of $X$ is 14.

# Conclusion

We've shown that the smallest positive integer $X$ that is 2 more than a multiple of 3 and has the same units digit as a number that is 4 more than a multiple of 5 is 14. The proof combines modular arithmetic with the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find that $X \equiv 14 \pmod{30}$, and therefore the smallest such $X$ is 14.
