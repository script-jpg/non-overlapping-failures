-- A positive integer $X$ is 2 more than a multiple of 3. 
  -- So it is of the form $X = 3k + 2$.
  have h1 : x % 3 = 2 := h₀

  -- Its units digit is the same as the units digit of a number that is 4 more than a multiple of 5.
  -- So it is of the form $X = 10m + 4$.
  have h2 : y % 5 = 4 := h₁

  -- What is the smallest possible value of $X$? Show that it is 14.
  have h3 : x % 10 = y % 10 := h₂

  -- It is enough to assume $Y = 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots$ and see which is the smallest that satisfies all conditions.
  -- In this case, it is 14.
