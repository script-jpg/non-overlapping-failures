have h₃ : x % 10 = 4 := by
    have : y % 10 = 4 := by omega
    rw [← h₂, this]
  omega
```

In this proof, we are given that:
- $x \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$ (h₀)
- $y \equiv 4 \pmod{5}$ (h₁)
- $x \equiv y \pmod{10}$ (h₂)

We need to find the smallest positive integer $X$ that satisfies these conditions. Let's determine the possible values of $x$ and $y$.

First, let's analyze the condition $x \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$. This means $x$ can be written as $x = 3k + 2$ for some integer $k$. The possible values of $x \pmod{10}$ are: $2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 0, 3, 6, 9$.

Next, for $y \equiv 4 \pmod{5}$, we have $y = 5m + 4$ for some integer $m$. The possible values of $y \pmod{10}$ are: $4, 9, 2, 7, 0, 3, 8, 1, 6, 5$.

The units digit of $x$ must equal the units digit of $y$. From the lists above, the common units digits are $2, 4, 7$.

So $x$ could be $2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 14, 17,...$ and $y$ could be $2, 4, 7, 8, 12, 14, 17,...$.

The smallest value of $x$ that satisfies all conditions is $14$.

In Lean 4, we can formalize the proof as follows:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

Now, we'll define our theorem with the given conditions:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_559 (x y : ℕ) (h₀ : x % 3 = 2) (h₁ : y % 5 = 4) (h₂ : x % 10 = y % 10) :
    14 ≤ x := by
```

We need to prove that $14 \leq x$ given the constraints. Let's analyze the problem more deeply:

From h₀: $x \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$
From h₁: $y \equiv 4 \pmod{5}$
From h₂: $x \equiv y \pmod{10}$

Let's determine the possible values of $x$:
- $x$ can be written as $3k + 2$ for some integer $k$
- $x \pmod{10}$ must be a value that appears in both the lists of possible values for $x \pmod{10}$ and $y \pmod{10}$

Possible values of $x \pmod{10}$: $2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 0, 3, 6, 9$
Possible values of $y \pmod{10}$: $4, 9, 2, 7, 0, 3, 8, 1, 6, 5$

Common values: $2, 4, 7$

So $x$ could be $2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 14, 17,...$

The smallest value of $x$ that satisfies all conditions is $14$.

In Lean, we can complete the proof with:

```tactics
have h₃ : x % 10 = 4 := by
  have : y % 10 = 4 := by omega
  rw [← h₂, this]
omega
```

The `omega` tactic is powerful for solving linear integer arithmetic problems. It automatically handles the reasoning about modular arithmetic and the constraints on $x$ and $y$.

In summary, the smallest possible value of $X$ that satisfies all conditions is indeed $14$.
