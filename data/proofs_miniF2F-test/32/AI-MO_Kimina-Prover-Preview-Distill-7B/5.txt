The key insight is that we need to find the smallest positive integer $X$ satisfying:
1. $X \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$
2. The units digit of $X$ is the same as the units digit of a number $Y$ where $Y \equiv 4 \pmod{5}$

First, let's analyze the condition on the units digit. If $Y \equiv 4 \pmod{5}$, then the units digit of $Y$ must be either 4 or 9. This is because a number is congruent to its units digit modulo 10, and the only digits that are congruent to 4 modulo 5 are 4 and 9.

So, the units digit of $X$ must be either 4 or 9. Let's consider these cases separately:

**Case 1: The units digit of $X$ is 4**
- $X \equiv 4 \pmod{10}$
- Also, $X \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$

We can solve this system of congruences using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. We need to find $X$ such that:
- $X \equiv 4 \pmod{10}$
- $X \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$

Checking numbers that end with 4:
- $4 \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$ (Doesn't work)
- $14 \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$ (This works)

So, $X = 14$ is a solution in this case.

**Case 2: The units digit of $X$ is 9**
- $X \equiv 9 \pmod{10}$
- Also, $X \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$

Again, using the Chinese Remainder Theorem:
- $X \equiv 9 \pmod{10}$
- $X \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$

Checking numbers that end with 9:
- $9 \equiv 0 \pmod{3}$ (Doesn't work)
- $19 \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$ (Doesn't work)
- $29 \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$ (This works)

So, $X = 29$ is a solution in this case.

Comparing both cases, the smallest possible value of $X$ is 14.

The Lean proof formalizes this reasoning by:
1. Proving that the units digit of $x$ is 4 (from h₂ and h₁)
2. Then using omega to solve the arithmetic constraints with the condition that $x \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$ and $x \equiv 4 \pmod{10}$

The omega tactic is powerful for this kind of arithmetic reasoning and can automatically deduce that 14 is the smallest such number.

Therefore, the smallest possible value of $X$ is 14.
