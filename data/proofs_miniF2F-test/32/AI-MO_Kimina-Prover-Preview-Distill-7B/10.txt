In this proof, we're trying to find the smallest value of $X$ (denoted as `x` in the formal) that satisfies the following conditions:
1. $X$ is 2 more than a multiple of 3 (i.e., $X \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$).
2. The units digit of $X$ is the same as the units digit of a number that is 4 more than a multiple of 5.

We start by analyzing these conditions:
- For the first condition, the numbers that satisfy $X \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$ are $2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, \ldots$ 
- For the second condition, the units digit of a number that is 4 more than a multiple of 5 can be found by looking at numbers like $4, 9, 14, 19, 24, 29, \ldots$ and examining their units digits: $4, 9, 4, 9, 4, 9, \ldots$

The common units digit between these two sequences is $4$. Therefore, $X$ must end in $4$.

Let's formalize this in Lean:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

```

We've imported the necessary libraries and set up the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_559 (x y : ℕ) (h₀ : x % 3 = 2) (h₁ : y % 5 = 4) (h₂ : x % 10 = y % 10) :
    14 ≤ x := by
```

Now we need to prove that $14 \leq x$ given these conditions. First, let's determine the units digit of $y$:

```tactics
have h₃ : x % 10 = 4 := by
  have : y % 10 = 4 := by omega
  rw [← h₂, this]
```

We've shown that the units digit of $x$ must be 4. Now we need to find the smallest value of $x$ that satisfies both $x \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$ and $x \equiv 4 \pmod{10}$.

Let's solve this using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. We need to find a number $x$ that satisfies:
- $x \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$
- $x \equiv 4 \pmod{10}$

Looking at numbers that satisfy $x \equiv 4 \pmod{10}$: $4, 14, 24, 34, 44, \ldots$
And checking which of these also satisfies $x \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$:
- $4 \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$ (no)
- $14 \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$ (yes)

So the smallest such number is $14$. 

Let's finish the proof by showing that $14 \leq x$:

```tactics
omega
```

The `omega` tactic is perfect here as it can solve goals involving linear integer arithmetic. It will automatically deduce that $14 \leq x$ given the constraints $x \equiv 2 \pmod{3}$ and $x \equiv 4 \pmod{10}$.

In conclusion, the smallest possible value of $X$ is 14.
