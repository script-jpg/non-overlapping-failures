  -- We need to find the smallest positive integer X that satisfies the given conditions.
  -- The conditions are:
  -- 1. X ≡ 2 (mod 3)
  -- 2. Y ≡ 4 (mod 5)
  -- 3. The units digit of X is the same as the units digit of Y.
  -- We will use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find the smallest X that satisfies all three conditions.
  -- First, we find the smallest X that satisfies the first two conditions.
  -- We need to find the smallest X such that X ≡ 2 (mod 3) and X ≡ 4 (mod 5).
  -- We can express X in terms of one of the moduli:
  -- X = 3k + 2 for some integer k.
  -- We substitute into the second congruence:
  -- 3k + 2 ≡ 4 (mod 5)
  -- 3k ≡ 2 (mod 5)
  -- To solve for k, we find the multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 5.
  -- The inverse of 3 modulo 5 is 2 (since 3 * 2 ≡ 1 (mod 5)).
  -- Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:
  -- k ≡ 4 (mod 5)
  -- Thus, k = 5m + 4 for some integer m.
  -- Substituting back, we get:
  -- X = 3(5m + 4) + 2 = 15m + 12 + 2 = 15m + 14.
  -- Therefore, X ≡ 14 (mod 15).
  -- Next, we incorporate the third condition: the units digit of X is the same as the units digit of Y.
  -- This means X ≡ Y (mod 10).
  -- Given Y ≡ 4 (mod 5), we can express Y as:
  -- Y = 5n + 4 for some integer n.
  -- We need X ≡ 5n + 4 (mod 10).
  -- Since X ≡ 14 (mod 15), we can write X as:
  -- X = 15p + 14 for some integer p.
  -- We need to find the smallest p such that 15p + 14 ≡ 5n + 4 (mod 10).
  -- Simplifying, we get:
  -- 15p + 14 ≡ 5n + 4 (mod 10)
  -- 5p + 4 ≡ 5n + 4 (mod 10)
  -- 5p ≡ 5n (mod 10)
  -- p ≡ n (mod 2)
  -- Thus, p can be any integer of the form 2q + 1 or 2q.
  -- To find the smallest X, we choose the smallest p, which is 0.
  -- Therefore, X = 15 * 0 + 14 = 14.
  -- We verify that X = 14 satisfies all three conditions:
  -- 1. 14 ≡ 2 (mod 3)
  -- 2. 14 ≡ 4 (mod 5)
  -- 3. The units digit of 14 is 4, which matches the units digit of 4.
