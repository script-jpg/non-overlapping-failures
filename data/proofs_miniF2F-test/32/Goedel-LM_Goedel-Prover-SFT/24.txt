  Given a positive integer \( X \) that is 2 more than a multiple of 3, and its units digit is the same as the units digit of a number that is 4 more than a multiple of 5, we need to find the smallest possible value of \( X \). We are to show that this value is 14.
  1. Let \( x \) be the smallest possible value of \( X \).
  2. Since \( X \) is 2 more than a multiple of 3, we have \( x \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \).
  3. The units digit of \( X \) must be the same as the units digit of a number that is 4 more than a multiple of 5, which is \( y \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \).
  4. Since the units digit of \( X \) is the same as the units digit of \( y \), we have \( x \equiv y \pmod{10} \).
  5. To find the smallest \( x \) that satisfies all these conditions, we use the Chinese Remainder Theorem.
  6. The system of congruences is:
     \[
     \begin{cases}
     x \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \\
     x \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \\
     x \equiv y \pmod{10}
     \end{cases}
     \]
  7. Solving this system, we find that \( x \equiv 14 \pmod{15} \).
  8. Therefore, the smallest possible value of \( X \) is 14.
