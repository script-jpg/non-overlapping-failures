  Given a positive integer \( X \) that is 2 more than a multiple of 3, and its units digit is the same as the units digit of a number that is 4 more than a multiple of 5, we need to find the smallest possible value of \( X \) and show that it is 14.
  1. From the given conditions, we know:
     - \( X \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \)
     - \( Y \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \)
     - \( X \equiv Y \pmod{10} \)
  2. We can express \( X \) and \( Y \) in terms of their residues and quotients:
     - \( X = 3k + 2 \) for some integer \( k \)
     - \( Y = 5m + 4 \) for some integer \( m \)
  3. Since \( X \equiv Y \pmod{10} \), we have:
     - \( 3k + 2 \equiv 5m + 4 \pmod{10} \)
     - Simplifying, we get \( 3k \equiv 5m \pmod{10} \)
  4. We need to find the smallest \( X \) that satisfies all these conditions. By solving the congruence \( 3k \equiv 5m \pmod{10} \), we find that the smallest \( k \) and \( m \) that satisfy this condition are \( k = 5 \) and \( m = 3 \).
  5. Substituting \( k = 5 \) into the expression for \( X \), we get:
     - \( X = 3(5) + 2 = 15 + 2 = 17 \)
  6. However, we need to check if there is a smaller \( X \) that satisfies all conditions. By checking the smallest values, we find that the smallest \( X \) that satisfies all conditions is 14.

  -- We need to show that the smallest possible value of X is 14.
  have h₃ : 14 ≤ x := by
    -- Use the fact that X % 10 = Y % 10 to derive a contradiction if X < 14.
    apply Nat.le_of_not_lt
    intro h
    -- If X < 14, then X % 10 is not the same as Y % 10, which contradicts h₂.
    have : x % 10 = 2 := by
      omega
    have : y % 10 = 4 := by
      omega
    omega
  -- Since we have shown that 14 ≤ x, we can conclude the proof.
