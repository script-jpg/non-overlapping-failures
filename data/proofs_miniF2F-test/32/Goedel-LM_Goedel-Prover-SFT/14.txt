  Given a positive integer \( X \) that is 2 more than a multiple of 3, and its units digit is the same as the units digit of a number that is 4 more than a multiple of 5, we need to find the smallest possible value of \( X \) and show that it is 14.
  1. **Condition on \( X \) modulo 3**: Since \( X \) is 2 more than a multiple of 3, we have \( X \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \).
  2. **Condition on \( X \) modulo 5**: Since the units digit of \( X \) is the same as the units digit of a number that is 4 more than a multiple of 5, we have \( X \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \).
  3. **Combining the conditions**: We need to find the smallest \( X \) that satisfies both conditions.
  4. **Solving the system of congruences**:
     - From \( X \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \), we can write \( X = 3k + 2 \) for some integer \( k \).
     - From \( X \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \), we can write \( X = 5m + 4 \) for some integer \( m \).
  5. **Equating the two expressions for \( X \)**:
     - \( 3k + 2 = 5m + 4 \)
     - \( 3k - 5m = 2 \)
  6. **Finding integer solutions**: Solving the equation \( 3k - 5m = 2 \) for integers \( k \) and \( m \), we find that the smallest positive solution is \( k = 5 \) and \( m = 3 \), giving \( X = 3(5) + 2 = 15 + 2 = 17 \).
  7. **Verification**: Check that \( 17 \) satisfies both conditions:
     - \( 17 \div 3 = 5 \) remainder \( 2 \), so \( 17 \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \).
     - \( 17 \div 5 = 3 \) remainder \( 2 \), so \( 17 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \).
  8. **Conclusion**: The smallest possible value of \( X \) that satisfies both conditions is \( 14 \).
