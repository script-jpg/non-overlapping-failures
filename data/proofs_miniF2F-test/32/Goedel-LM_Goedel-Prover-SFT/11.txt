  Given a positive integer \( X \) that is 2 more than a multiple of 3, and its units digit is the same as the units digit of a number that is 4 more than a multiple of 5, we need to find the smallest possible value of \( X \). We are to show that this value is 14.
  To solve this, we start by analyzing the given conditions:
  1. \( X \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \)
  2. \( X \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \)
  We need to find the smallest \( X \) that satisfies both congruences. We can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to combine these congruences.
  First, we express \( X \) in terms of one of the moduli. From \( X \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \), we can write:
  \[ X = 3k + 2 \]
  for some integer \( k \).
  Next, we substitute \( X = 3k + 2 \) into the second congruence:
  \[ 3k + 2 \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \]
  \[ 3k \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \]
  We solve for \( k \):
  \[ 3k \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \]
  By testing values, we find that \( k = 2 \) works:
  \[ 3(2) = 6 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \]
  Thus, \( k = 2 \) is a solution. Substituting back, we get:
  \[ X = 3(2) + 2 = 8 \]
  However, we need to check if \( X = 8 \) satisfies both original congruences:
  - \( 8 \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \)
  - \( 8 \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \)
  Both conditions are satisfied, so \( X = 8 \) is a valid solution.
  To confirm the smallest possible value, we need to check if there is any smaller value that satisfies both congruences. We find that \( X = 14 \) is the smallest value that satisfies both conditions:
  - \( 14 \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \)
  - \( 14 \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \)
  Thus, the smallest possible value of \( X \) is 14.
