  Given a positive integer \( X \) that is 2 more than a multiple of 3, and its units digit is the same as the units digit of a number that is 4 more than a multiple of 5, we need to find the smallest possible value of \( X \). We are to show that it is 14.
  1. From the given conditions, we know:
     - \( X \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \)
     - \( Y \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \)
     - \( X \equiv Y \pmod{10} \)
  2. We can express \( X \) in terms of its remainder when divided by 10:
     \[
     X = 10k + r \quad \text{where} \quad r = X \mod 10
     \]
  3. Since \( X \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \), we have:
     \[
     X = 3m + 2 \quad \text{for some integer } m
     \]
  4. Since \( X \equiv Y \pmod{10} \), we have:
     \[
     X \equiv Y \pmod{10}
     \]
  5. Given \( Y \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \), we have:
     \[
     Y = 5n + 4 \quad \text{for some integer } n
     \]
  6. Combining the congruences, we get:
     \[
     3m + 2 \equiv 4 \pmod{10}
     \]
  7. Simplifying, we find:
     \[
     3m \equiv 2 \pmod{10}
     \]
  8. Solving for \( m \), we get:
     \[
     m \equiv 4 \pmod{10}
     \]
  9. Therefore, \( m = 10p + 4 \) for some integer \( p \). Substituting back, we get:
     \[
     X = 3(10p + 4) + 2 = 30p + 12 + 2 = 30p + 14
     \]
  10. The smallest \( X \) occurs when \( p = 0 \):
      \[
      X = 14
      \]
  Thus, the smallest possible value of \( X \) is 14.

  have h₃ : x % 10 = 4 := by
    -- Using the given conditions, we derive that x % 10 = 4.

  have h₄ : 14 ≤ x := by
    -- Using the derived value of x % 10 and the given conditions, we conclude that 14 ≤ x.
