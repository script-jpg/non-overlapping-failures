  Given a positive integer \( X \) that is 2 more than a multiple of 3, and its units digit is the same as the units digit of a number that is 4 more than a multiple of 5, we need to find the smallest possible value of \( X \) and show that it is 14.
  1. Let \( X = 10k + r \) where \( k \) is an integer and \( r \) is the remainder when \( X \) is divided by 10.
  2. Since \( X \) is 2 more than a multiple of 3, \( X \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \).
  3. The units digit of \( X \) is \( r \). Since \( X \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \), \( r \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \).
  4. The units digit of \( X \) is also the same as the units digit of \( r \).
  5. We need to find the smallest \( X \) such that \( X \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \) and \( X \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \).
  6. Solving the system of congruences:
     - \( X \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \)
     - \( X \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \)
  7. The smallest solution to these congruences is \( X = 14 \).
