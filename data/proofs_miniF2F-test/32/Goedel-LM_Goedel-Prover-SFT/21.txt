  Given a positive integer \( X \) such that \( X \) is 2 more than a multiple of 3, and its units digit is the same as the units digit of a number that is 4 more than a multiple of 5, we need to find the smallest possible value of \( X \) and show that it is 14.
  1. From the condition \( X \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \), we can write \( X = 3k + 2 \) for some integer \( k \).
  2. From the condition \( X \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \), we can write \( X = 5m + 4 \) for some integer \( m \).
  3. Equating the two expressions for \( X \), we get \( 3k + 2 = 5m + 4 \), which simplifies to \( 3k - 5m = 2 \).
  4. Solving this linear Diophantine equation, we find that the smallest positive integer solution is \( k = 4 \) and \( m = 2 \).
  5. Substituting \( k = 4 \) into \( X = 3k + 2 \), we get \( X = 3(4) + 2 = 14 \).
  6. Therefore, the smallest possible value of \( X \) is 14.
