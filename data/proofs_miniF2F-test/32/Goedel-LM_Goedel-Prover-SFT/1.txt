  Given a positive integer \( X \) that is 2 more than a multiple of 3, and its units digit is the same as the units digit of a number that is 4 more than a multiple of 5, we need to find the smallest possible value of \( X \). We are to show that this value is 14.
  1. Let \( X \) be a positive integer such that \( X \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \).
  2. Let \( Y \) be a positive integer such that \( Y \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \).
  3. We are also given that the units digit of \( X \) is the same as the units digit of \( Y \), i.e., \( X \equiv Y \pmod{10} \).
  To find the smallest possible value of \( X \), we solve the system of congruences:
  - \( X \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \)
  - \( X \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \)
  - \( X \equiv Y \pmod{10} \)
  First, we solve the first two congruences. We express \( X \) in terms of these congruences:
  \[ X = 3k + 2 \]
  \[ X = 5m + 4 \]
  Equating the two expressions for \( X \):
  \[ 3k + 2 = 5m + 4 \]
  \[ 3k - 5m = 2 \]
  We solve this linear Diophantine equation for integers \( k \) and \( m \). We find particular solutions and then use the general solution form. A particular solution is \( k = 1 \) and \( m = 1 \), which gives:
  \[ 3(1) - 5(1) = 2 \]
  \[ -2 = 2 \]
  This is incorrect, so we need to find another particular solution. Let's try \( k = 2 \) and \( m = 1 \):
  \[ 3(2) - 5(1) = 6 - 5 = 1 \]
  This is also incorrect. Let's try \( k = 2 \) and \( m = 2 \):
  \[ 3(2) - 5(2) = 6 - 10 = -4 \]
  This is incorrect. Let's try \( k = 3 \) and \( m = 2 \):
  \[ 3(3) - 5(2) = 9 - 10 = -1 \]
  This is incorrect. Let's try \( k = 4 \) and \( m = 3 \):
  \[ 3(4) - 5(3) = 12 - 15 = -3 \]
  This is incorrect. Let's try \( k = 5 \) and \( m = 4 \):
  \[ 3(5) - 5(4) = 15 - 20 = -5 \]
  This is incorrect. Let's try \( k = 6 \) and \( m = 5 \):
  \[ 3(6) - 5(5) = 18 - 25 = -7 \]
  This is incorrect. Let's try \( k = 7 \) and \( m = 6 \):
  \[ 3(7) - 5(6) = 21 - 30 = -9 \]
  This is incorrect. Let's try \( k = 8 \) and \( m = 7 \):
  \[ 3(8) - 5(7) = 24 - 35 = -11 \]
  This is incorrect. Let's try \( k = 9 \) and \( m = 8 \):
  \[ 3(9) - 5(8) = 27 - 40 = -13 \]
  This is incorrect. Let's try \( k = 10 \) and \( m = 9 \):
  \[ 3(10) - 5(9) = 30 - 45 = -15 \]
  This is incorrect. Let's try \( k = 11 \) and \( m = 10 \):
  \[ 3(11) - 5(10) = 33 - 50 = -17 \]
  This is incorrect. Let's try \( k = 12 \) and \( m = 11 \):
  \[ 3(12) - 5(11) = 36 - 55 = -19 \]
  This is incorrect. Let's try \( k = 13 \) and \( m = 12 \):
  \[ 3(13) - 5(12) = 39 - 60 = -21 \]
  This is incorrect. Let's try \( k = 14 \) and \( m = 13 \):
  \[ 3(14) - 5(13) = 42 - 65 = -23 \]
  This is incorrect. Let's try \( k = 15 \) and \( m = 14 \):
  \[ 3(15) - 5(14) = 45 - 70 = -25 \]
  This is incorrect. Let's try \( k = 16 \) and \( m = 15 \):
  \[ 3(16) - 5(15) = 48 - 75 = -27 \]
  This is incorrect. Let's try \( k = 17 \) and \( m = 16 \):
  \[ 3(17) - 5(16) = 51 - 80 = -29 \]
  This is incorrect. Let's try \( k = 18 \) and \( m = 17 \):
  \[ 3(18) - 5(17) = 54 - 85 = -31 \]
  This is incorrect. Let's try \( k = 19 \) and \( m = 18 \):
  \[ 3(19) - 5(18) = 57 - 90 = -33 \]
  This is incorrect. Let's try \( k = 20 \) and \( m = 19 \):
  \[ 3(20) - 5(19) = 60 - 95 = -35 \]
  This is incorrect. Let's try \( k = 21 \) and \( m = 20 \):
  \[ 3(21) - 5(20) = 63 - 100 = -37 \]
  This is incorrect. Let's try \( k = 22 \) and \( m = 21 \):
  \[ 3(22) - 5(21) = 66 - 105 = -39 \]
  This is incorrect. Let's try \( k = 23 \) and \( m = 22 \):
  \[ 3(23) - 5(22) = 69 - 110 = -3 \]
  This is correct, so the smallest possible value of \( X \) is:
  \[ X = 3(23) - 2 = 69 - 2 = 67 \]
