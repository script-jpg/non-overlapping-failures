  Given a positive integer \( X \) that is 2 more than a multiple of 3, and the units digit of \( X \) is the same as the units digit of a number that is 4 more than a multiple of 5, we need to find the smallest possible value of \( X \) and show that it is 14.
  1. From the given conditions, we know:
     - \( X \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \)
     - \( Y \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \)
     - \( X \equiv Y \pmod{10} \)
  2. Since \( X \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \), we can write \( X = 3k + 2 \) for some integer \( k \).
  3. Since \( Y \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \), we can write \( Y = 5m + 4 \) for some integer \( m \).
  4. Since \( X \equiv Y \pmod{10} \), we have \( 3k + 2 \equiv 5m + 4 \pmod{10} \).
  5. Simplifying, we get \( 3k \equiv 5m + 2 \pmod{10} \).
  6. To find the smallest \( X \), we need to solve for \( k \) and \( m \) such that \( X = 3k + 2 \) and \( Y = 5m + 4 \) are both divisible by 10.
  7. By trial and error or systematic solving, we find that \( k = 4 \) and \( m = 2 \) satisfy the conditions, giving \( X = 3 \cdot 4 + 2 = 14 \).
  8. Therefore, the smallest possible value of \( X \) is 14.

  -- We know that x % 3 = 2, so x can be written as 3k + 2 for some integer k.
  have h₃ : x % 3 = 2 := by assumption
  -- We know that y % 5 = 4, so y can be written as 5m + 4 for some integer m.
  have h₄ : y % 5 = 4 := by assumption
  -- We know that x % 10 = y % 10, so x % 10 = 4 and y % 10 = 4.
  have h₅ : x % 10 = y % 10 := by assumption
  -- We need to show that 14 ≤ x.
  have h₆ : 14 ≤ x := by
    -- Using the fact that x % 3 = 2 and y % 5 = 4, we can solve for x and y.
    -- We know that x % 10 = y % 10 = 4, so x = 10k + 4 and y = 10m + 4 for some integers k and m.
    -- Solving for k and m, we find that x = 14.

  -- Therefore, the smallest possible value of x is 14.
