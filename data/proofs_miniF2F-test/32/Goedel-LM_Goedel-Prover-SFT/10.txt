  Given a positive integer \( X \) that is 2 more than a multiple of 3, and its units digit is the same as the units digit of a number that is 4 more than a multiple of 5, we need to find the smallest possible value of \( X \) and show that it is 14.
  1. **Understanding the Conditions**:
     - \( X \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \)
     - \( X \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \)
  2. **Finding the Smallest Value**:
     - We need to find the smallest \( X \) that satisfies both congruences.
     - Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we can solve the system of congruences.
  3. **Solving the System**:
     - \( X \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \)
     - \( X \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \)
     - We can express \( X \) as \( 3k + 2 \) for some integer \( k \).
     - Substituting into the second congruence: \( 3k + 2 \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \).
     - Simplifying, \( 3k \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \).
     - Multiplying both sides by the modular inverse of 3 modulo 5, which is 2 (since \( 3 \times 2 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \)): \( k \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \).
     - Thus, \( k = 5m + 4 \) for some integer \( m \).
     - Substituting back, \( X = 3(5m + 4) + 2 = 15m + 12 + 2 = 15m + 14 \).
  4. **Finding the Smallest \( X \)**:
     - The smallest \( X \) occurs when \( m = 0 \), giving \( X = 14 \).
  5. **Verification**:
     - \( 14 \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \)
     - \( 14 \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \)
     - Therefore, 14 satisfies both conditions, and it is the smallest such value.

  have h₃ : x % 3 = 2 := by assumption
  have h₄ : y % 5 = 4 := by assumption
  have h₅ : x % 10 = y % 10 := by assumption
  -- We need to show that 14 is the smallest value satisfying the given conditions.
  -- Since x % 10 = y % 10, we can use this to derive a relationship between x and y.
  have h₆ : 14 ≤ x := by
    -- Using the properties of modular arithmetic, we can solve the system of congruences.
    -- We know x % 3 = 2 and y % 5 = 4, so we can use these to find the smallest x.
