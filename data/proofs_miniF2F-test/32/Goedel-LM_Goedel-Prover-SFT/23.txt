  Given a positive integer \( X \) that is 2 more than a multiple of 3, and its units digit is the same as the units digit of a number that is 4 more than a multiple of 5, we need to find the smallest possible value of \( X \).
  First, we express \( X \) in terms of its modulo 3 and modulo 5 properties. Since \( X \) is 2 more than a multiple of 3, we can write \( X = 3k + 2 \) for some integer \( k \).
  Next, we consider the units digit of \( X \). The units digit of \( X \) is the same as the units digit of \( 4 + 5m \) for some integer \( m \). This is because the units digit of \( 4 + 5m \) is always 4, and the units digit of \( X \) must also be 4.
  We need to find the smallest \( X \) that satisfies these conditions. We start by testing values of \( k \) and \( m \) to find the smallest \( X \).
  Testing values:
  - For \( k = 0 \), \( X = 2 \).
  - For \( k = 1 \), \( X = 5 \).
  - For \( k = 2 \), \( X = 8 \).
  - For \( k = 3 \), \( X = 11 \).
  - For \( k = 4 \), \( X = 14 \).
  - For \( m = 0 \), \( X = 4 \).
  - For \( m = 1 \), \( X = 9 \).
  - For \( m = 2 \), \( X = 14 \).
  From these tests, we see that the smallest \( X \) that satisfies both conditions is \( X = 14 \).
