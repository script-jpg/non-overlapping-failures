  To prove the inequality \(a^2(b+c-a) + b^2(c+a-b) + c^2(a+b-c) \leq 3abc\) for the sides \(a, b, c\) of a triangle, we can use the non-linear arithmetic (nlinarith) tactic in Lean4. This tactic is designed to handle inequalities involving polynomials and can automatically deduce the desired inequality by leveraging the non-negativity of squares and the given triangle inequalities.
