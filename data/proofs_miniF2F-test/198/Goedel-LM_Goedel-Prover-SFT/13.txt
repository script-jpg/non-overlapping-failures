  We need to prove that for positive real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy the triangle inequalities, the inequality \(a^2(b+c-a) + b^2(c+a-b) + c^2(a+b-c) \leq 3abc\) holds.
  1. **Case Analysis**: We start by considering different cases for the relationships between \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). These cases are derived from the triangle inequalities and the fact that \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are positive.
  2. **Non-negativity of Squares**: Utilize the non-negativity of squares to simplify the expressions. Specifically, we use the fact that \((a - b)^2 \geq 0\), \((b - c)^2 \geq 0\), \((c - a)^2 \geq 0\), and \((a + b - c)^2 \geq 0\), \((b + c - a)^2 \geq 0\), \((c + a - b)^2 \geq 0\).
  3. **Combining Inequalities**: Combine the inequalities derived from the non-negativity of squares to show that the left-hand side of the inequality is less than or equal to the right-hand side.
