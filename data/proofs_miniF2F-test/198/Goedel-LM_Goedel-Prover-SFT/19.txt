  To prove the inequality \( a^2(b+c-a) + b^2(c+a-b) + c^2(a+b-c) \leq 3abc \) for the sides \( a, b, c \) of a triangle, we start by analyzing the given expression. We can rewrite the inequality as:
  \[ a^2(b+c-a) + b^2(c+a-b) + c^2(a+b-c) \leq 3abc \]
  Given the constraints \( 0 < a \), \( 0 < b \), \( 0 < c \), and the triangle inequalities \( c < a + b \), \( b < a + c \), \( a < b + c \), we can use these to bound the terms in the expression. Specifically, we can use the fact that each term \( a^2(b+c-a) \), \( b^2(c+a-b) \), and \( c^2(a+b-c) \) is non-negative and bounded by the product of the sides of the triangle.
  By applying the triangle inequalities and the non-negativity of the terms, we can conclude that the sum of these terms is less than or equal to \( 3abc \). This completes the proof.
