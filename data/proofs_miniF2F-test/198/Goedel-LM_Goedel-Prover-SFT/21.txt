  To prove the inequality \(a^2(b+c-a) + b^2(c+a-b) + c^2(a+b-c) \leq 3abc\) for the sides \(a, b, c\) of a triangle, we can use the fact that the triangle inequality holds. Specifically, we know that \(a + b > c\), \(b + c > a\), and \(c + a > b\). This implies that the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side.
  Given these conditions, we can use non-linear arithmetic to verify the inequality. The `nlinarith` tactic in Lean4 is designed to handle inequalities involving polynomials and can automatically deduce the desired inequality by leveraging the given conditions and basic algebraic properties.
