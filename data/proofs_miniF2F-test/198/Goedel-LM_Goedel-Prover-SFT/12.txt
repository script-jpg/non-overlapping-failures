  We need to prove that for the sides \(a, b, c\) of a triangle, the inequality \(a^2(b+c-a) + b^2(c+a-b) + c^2(a+b-c) \leq 3abc\) holds. Given the conditions \(0 < a\), \(0 < b\), \(0 < c\), and the triangle inequalities \(c < a + b\), \(b < a + c\), \(a < b + c\), we can use these to establish the inequality through algebraic manipulation and simplification.

  -- We start by noting the triangle inequalities.
  have h₄ : c < a + b := h₁
  have h₅ : b < a + c := h₂
  have h₆ : a < b + c := h₃
  -- We need to show that the given expression is less than or equal to 3abc.
  have h₇ : a ^ 2 * (b + c - a) + b ^ 2 * (c + a - b) + c ^ 2 * (a + b - c) ≤ 3 * a * b * c := by
    -- Use the triangle inequalities to establish bounds for the terms.
    nlinarith [sq_nonneg (a - b), sq_nonneg (b - c), sq_nonneg (c - a)]
  -- Finally, we conclude the proof by using the established inequality.
