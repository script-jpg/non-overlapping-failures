  To prove the inequality \(a^2(b+c-a) + b^2(c+a-b) + c^2(a+b-c) \leq 3abc\) for the sides \(a, b, c\) of a triangle, we can use the non-negativity of squares and some algebraic manipulations. Specifically, we will use the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative, and apply this to various expressions involving \(a, b,\) and \(c\).
