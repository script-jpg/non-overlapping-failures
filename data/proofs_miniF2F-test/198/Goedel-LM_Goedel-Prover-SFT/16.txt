  We need to prove that for the sides \(a, b, c\) of a triangle, the inequality \(a^2(b+c-a) + b^2(c+a-b) + c^2(a+b-c) \leq 3abc\) holds. Given the conditions \(0 < a\), \(0 < b\), \(0 < c\), and the triangle inequalities \(c < a + b\), \(b < a + c\), \(a < b + c\), we can use non-linear arithmetic to verify this inequality.

  -- The `nlinarith` tactic will check the non-negativity of squares and other algebraic properties to verify the inequality.
