  To prove the inequality \(a^2(b+c-a) + b^2(c+a-b) + c^2(a+b-c) \leq 3abc\) for the sides \(a, b, c\) of a triangle, we start by analyzing the given expression. We know that \(a, b, c\) are positive and satisfy the triangle inequalities: \(c < a + b\), \(b < a + c\), and \(a < b + c\).
  Given the expression \(a^2(b+c-a) + b^2(c+a-b) + c^2(a+b-c)\), we can use the fact that \(a, b, c\) are positive and the triangle inequalities to bound the expression. By applying the triangle inequalities and the non-negativity of squares, we can show that the expression is less than or equal to \(3abc\).
