  To prove the inequality \(a^2(b+c-a) + b^2(c+a-b) + c^2(a+b-c) \leq 3abc\) for the sides \(a, b, c\) of a triangle, we start by analyzing the given expression. The goal is to show that the sum of the terms involving squares and differences of the sides is bounded by \(3abc\).
  Given the conditions \(0 < a\), \(0 < b\), \(0 < c\), and the triangle inequalities \(c < a + b\), \(b < a + c\), \(a < b + c\), we can use these conditions to establish the non-negativity of the terms involved. Specifically, we will use the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative, and the product of non-negative numbers is also non-negative.
  By expanding and simplifying the expression, we can show that it is indeed bounded by \(3abc\). This involves using the non-negativity of the squares and the triangle inequalities to ensure that the sum of the terms is less than or equal to \(3abc\).
