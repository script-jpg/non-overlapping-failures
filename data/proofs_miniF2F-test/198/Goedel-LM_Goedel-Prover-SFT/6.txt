  To prove the inequality \(a^2(b+c-a) + b^2(c+a-b) + c^2(a+b-c) \leq 3abc\) for the sides \(a, b, c\) of a triangle, we can use the non-linear arithmetic (nlinarith) tactic in Lean4. This tactic is designed to handle inequalities involving polynomials and can automatically deduce the desired inequality from the given conditions. Specifically, we will use the non-negativity of squares to establish the inequality.
