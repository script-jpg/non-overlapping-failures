-- Use `nlinarith` to handle the inequality after simplification.
-- This tactic is capable of solving the inequality by linear arithmetic and simplification.
-- The `sq_nonneg` lemmas are used to ensure all terms are non-negative, which helps in concluding the proof.
-- The `mul_pos` lemmas are used to handle the positivity of various terms, ensuring the terms inside the squares are positive.
-- The `sub_pos` lemmas are used to handle the subtraction and positivity, ensuring the terms inside the squares are positive.
-- The `add_pos` lemmas are used to handle the addition and positivity, ensuring the terms inside the squares are positive.
-- The `mul_assoc` lemmas are used to ensure the terms are correctly associated, which helps in simplifying the expression.
-- The `mul_comm` lemmas are used to ensure the terms are correctly commuted, which helps in simplifying the expression.
-- The `mul_left_comm` lemmas are used to ensure the terms are correctly left-associated, which helps in simplifying the expression.
