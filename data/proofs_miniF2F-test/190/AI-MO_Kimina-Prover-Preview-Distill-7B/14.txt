-- The sum of the first 5 terms of an arithmetic series is $70$.  The sum of the first 10 terms of this  arithmetic series is $210$.  What is the first term of the series? Show that it is \frac{42}{5}.

  -- The sum of the first 5 terms is $5a + 10d = 70$.
  have h₂ : 5 * a + 10 * d = 70 := by
    simp [Finset.sum_range_succ, add_mul, mul_add] at h₀
    linarith

  -- The sum of the first 10 terms is $10a + 45d = 210$.
  have h₃ : 10 * a + 45 * d = 210 := by
    simp [Finset.sum_range_succ, add_mul, mul_add] at h₁
    linarith

  -- So $2a + 4d = 14$ and $2a + 9d = 21$.  So $5d = 7$ and $d = \frac{7}{5}$.
  have h₄ : 5 * d = 7 := by linarith

  -- So $a = \frac{42}{5}$.
  have h₅ : 2 * a + 9 * d = 21 := by linarith
  have h₆ : 2 * a = 21 - 9 * d := by linarith
  have h₇ : 2 * a = 42 / 5 := by linarith
