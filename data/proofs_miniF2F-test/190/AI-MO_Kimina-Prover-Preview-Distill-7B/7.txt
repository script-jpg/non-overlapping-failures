-- The sum of the first 5 terms of an arithmetic series is $70$.  The sum of the first 10 terms of this  arithmetic series is $210$.  What is the first term of the series? Show that it is \frac{42}{5}.

  -- The sum of the first 5 terms is 5a + 10d = 70.

  have sum5 : (∑ k in Finset.range 5, a + k * d) = 5 * a + 10 * d := by

    simp only [Finset.sum_range_succ, add_mul, mul_add]

    ring

  -- The sum of the first 10 terms is 10a + 45d = 210.

  have sum10 : (∑ k in Finset.range 10, a + k * d) = 10 * a + 45 * d := by

    simp only [Finset.sum_range_succ, add_mul, mul_add]

    ring

  -- So the first term is 42/5.
