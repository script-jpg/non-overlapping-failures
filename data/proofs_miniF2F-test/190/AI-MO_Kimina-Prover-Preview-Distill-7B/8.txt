-- The sum of the first 5 terms of an arithmetic series is $70$.  The sum of the first 10 terms of this  arithmetic series is $210$.  What is the first term of the series? Show that it is \frac{42}{5}.

  -- The sum of the first 5 terms is $5a + 10d = 70$.
  have eq₁ : 5 * a + 10 * d = 70 := by
    simp [Finset.sum_range_succ, add_mul, mul_add] at h₀
    linarith only [h₀]

  -- The sum of the first 10 terms is $10a + 45d = 210$.
  have eq₂ : 10 * a + 45 * d = 210 := by
    simp [Finset.sum_range_succ, add_mul, mul_add] at h₁
    linarith only [h₁]

  -- So $20a + 100d = 140$.
  have eq₃ : 20 * a + 100 * d = 140 := by
    linarith only [eq₁, eq₂]

  -- So $20a + 35d = 70$.
  have eq₄ : 20 * a + 35 * d = 70 := by
    linarith only [eq₃, eq₂]

  -- So $75d = 420$.
  have eq₅ : 75 * d = 420 := by
    linarith only [eq₄, eq₁]

  -- So $d = \frac{420}{75} = \frac{14}{5}$.
  have hd : d = 14 / 5 := by
    linarith only [eq₅]

  -- So $5a = 70 - 10d = 70 - 10 \cdot \frac{14}{5} = 70 - 28 = 42$.
  have eq₆ : 5 * a = 42 := by
    linarith only [eq₁, hd]

  -- So $a = \frac{42}{5}$.
  linarith only [eq₆]
