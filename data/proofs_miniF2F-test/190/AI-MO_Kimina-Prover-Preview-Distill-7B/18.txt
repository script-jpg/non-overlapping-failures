-- The sum of the first 5 terms of an arithmetic series is $70$.  The sum of the first 10 terms of this  arithmetic series is $210$.  What is the first term of the series? Show that it is \frac{42}{5}.

  -- The sum of the first 5 terms is $5a + 10d = 70$.
  have h₂ : 5 * a + 10 * d = 70 := by

  have h₅ : 20 * a + 90 * d = 420 := by

  -- So $10d = -280$.
  have h₆ : 10 * d = -280 := by
    linarith [h₄, h₅]

  -- So $d = -28$.
  have h₇ : d = -28 := by

  -- So $5a + 10(-28) = 70$.
  have h₈ : 5 * a + 10 * (-28) = 70 := by

  -- So $5a = 350$.
  have h₉ : 5 * a = 350 := by
