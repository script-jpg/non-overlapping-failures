-- The sum of the first 5 terms of an arithmetic series is $70$.  The sum of the first 10 terms of this  arithmetic series is $210$.  What is the first term of the series? Show that it is \frac{42}{5}.

  -- The sum of the first 5 terms is $5a + 10d = 70$.
  have h₂ : 5 * a + 10 * d = 70 := by
    simp [Finset.sum_range_succ, add_mul, mul_add] at h₀
    linarith only [h₀]

  -- The sum of the first 10 terms is $10a + 45d = 210$.
  have h₃ : 10 * a + 45 * d = 210 := by
    simp [Finset.sum_range_succ, add_mul, mul_add] at h₁
    linarith only [h₁]

  -- So $35d = 140$ and $d = 4$.
  have h₄ : d = 4 := by
    linarith only [h₂, h₃]

  -- So $5a + 40 = 70$ and $a = \frac{42}{5}$.
  linarith only [h₂, h₄]
