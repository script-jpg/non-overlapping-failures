-- The sum of the first 5 terms of an arithmetic series is $70$.  The sum of the first 10 terms of this  arithmetic series is $210$.  What is the first term of the series? Show that it is \frac{42}{5}.

  -- The sum of the first 5 terms is $5a + 10d = 70$. The sum of the first 10 terms is $10a + 45d = 210$. Solve this system of equations to get $a = \frac{42}{5}$.
