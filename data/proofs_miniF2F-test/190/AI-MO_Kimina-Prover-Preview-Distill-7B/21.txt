-- The sum of the first 5 terms of an arithmetic series is $70$.  The sum of the first 10 terms of this  arithmetic series is $210$.  What is the first term of the series? Show that it is \frac{42}{5}.

  -- according to the formula of arithmetic series, we have

  -- $5a + 10d = 70$ and $10a + 45d = 210$.

  simp [Finset.sum_range_succ, add_mul, mul_add] at h₀ h₁

  -- then we have $d = 28/5$ and $a = 42/5$.

  have h2 : d = 28 / 5 := by linarith

  have h3 : a = 42 / 5 := by linarith

  exact h3
