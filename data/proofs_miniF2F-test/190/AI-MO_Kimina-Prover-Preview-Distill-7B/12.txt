-- The sum of the first 5 terms of an arithmetic series is $70$.  The sum of the first 10 terms of this  arithmetic series is $210$.  What is the first term of the series? Show that it is \frac{42}{5}.

  -- according to the formula of arithmetic series sum, we have
  -- 5a + 10d = 70
  -- 10a + 45d = 210
  -- so we solve
  -- a = 42 / 5
  -- d = 22 / 5

  -- first term : a
  -- second term : a + d
  -- third term : a + 2d
  --...
  -- nth term : a + (n-1)d

  -- sum of first n terms : na + d * (0 + 1 + 2 +... + (n-1))
  -- where 0 + 1 + 2 +... + (n-1) = (n-1)n/2
