  Given the sum of the first 5 terms of an arithmetic series is 70, and the sum of the first 10 terms of this arithmetic series is 210, we need to find the first term of the series. We are given the sums:
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{4} (a + kd) = 70
  \]
  \[
  \sum_{k=0}^{9} (a + kd) = 210
  \]
  We can express these sums in terms of \(a\) and \(d\):
  \[
  5a + 10d = 70 \quad \text{(1)}
  \]
  \[
  10a + 45d = 210 \quad \text{(2)}
  \]
  To solve for \(a\) and \(d\), we can use these equations. First, solve equation (1) for \(a\):
  \[
  5a + 10d = 70 \implies a + 2d = 14 \implies a = 14 - 2d
  \]
  Next, substitute \(a = 14 - 2d\) into equation (2):
  \[
  10(14 - 2d) + 45d = 210 \implies 140 - 20d + 45d = 210 \implies 140 + 25d = 210 \implies 25d = 70 \implies d = \frac{70}{25} = \frac{14}{5}
  \]
  Now substitute \(d = \frac{14}{5}\) back into \(a = 14 - 2d\):
  \[
  a = 14 - 2 \left(\frac{14}{5}\right) = 14 - \frac{28}{5} = \frac{70}{5} - \frac{28}{5} = \frac{42}{5}
  \]
  Thus, the first term of the series is \(a = \frac{42}{5}\).
