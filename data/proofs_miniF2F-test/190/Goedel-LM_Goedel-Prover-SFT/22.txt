  Given the sum of the first 5 terms of an arithmetic series is 70 and the sum of the first 10 terms of this arithmetic series is 210, we need to find the first term \( a \) of the series. We will show that \( a = \frac{42}{5} \).
  First, we express the sums of the first 5 and 10 terms of the arithmetic series:
  \[ S_5 = a + (a + d) + (a + 2d) + (a + 3d) + (a + 4d) \]
  \[ S_{10} = a + (a + d) + (a + 2d) + (a + 3d) + (a + 4d) + (a + 5d) + (a + 6d) + (a + 7d) + (a + 8d) + (a + 9d) \]
  Given \( S_5 = 70 \) and \( S_{10} = 210 \), we have:
  \[ 5a + 10d = 70 \]
  \[ 10a + 45d = 210 \]
  Next, we simplify these equations by dividing the first equation by 5 and the second by 10:
  \[ a + 2d = 14 \]
  \[ a + 4.5d = 21 \]
  Subtract the first simplified equation from the second:
  \[ (a + 4.5d) - (a + 2d) = 21 - 14 \]
  \[ 2.5d = 7 \]
  \[ d = \frac{7}{2.5} = \frac{14}{5} \]
  Substitute \( d = \frac{14}{5} \) back into \( a + 2d = 14 \):
  \[ a + 2 \cdot \frac{14}{5} = 14 \]
  \[ a + \frac{28}{5} = 14 \]
  \[ a = 14 - \frac{28}{5} \]
  \[ a = \frac{70}{5} - \frac{28}{5} \]
  \[ a = \frac{42}{5} \]
  Thus, the first term \( a \) of the series is \( \frac{42}{5} \).
