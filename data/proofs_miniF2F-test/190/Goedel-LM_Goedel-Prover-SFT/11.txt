  Given the sum of the first 5 terms of an arithmetic series is 70, and the sum of the first 10 terms of this arithmetic series is 210, we need to find the first term \( a \) of the series. We are to show that \( a = \frac{42}{5} \).
  1. Start by expressing the sum of the first 5 terms:
     \[
     a + (a + d) + (a + 2d) + (a + 3d) + (a + 4d) = 70
     \]
     Simplifying this, we get:
     \[
     5a + 10d = 70
     \]
  2. Next, express the sum of the first 10 terms:
     \[
     a + (a + d) + (a + 2d) + \cdots + (a + 9d) = 210
     \]
     This can be written as:
     \[
     10a + 45d = 210
     \]
  3. We now have two equations:
     \[
     5a + 10d = 70
     \]
     \[
     10a + 45d = 210
     \]
  4. Solve the first equation for \( a \):
     \[
     5a + 10d = 70 \implies a + 2d = 14
     \]
  5. Substitute \( a + 2d = 14 \) into the second equation:
     \[
     10a + 45d = 210
     \]
     Simplify this equation:
     \[
     10(a + 2d) + 45d = 210 \implies 10(14) + 45d = 210 \implies 140 + 45d = 210 \implies 45d = 70 \implies d = \frac{70}{45} = \frac{14}{9}
     \]
  6. Substitute \( d = \frac{14}{9} \) back into \( a + 2d = 14 \):
     \[
     a + 2 \left( \frac{14}{9} \right) = 14 \implies a + \frac{28}{9} = 14 \implies a = 14 - \frac{28}{9} = \frac{126}{9} - \frac{28}{9} = \frac{98}{9} = \frac{42}{5}
     \]
  Thus, the first term \( a \) is \( \frac{42}{5} \).
