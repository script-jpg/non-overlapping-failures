  Given the sum of the first 5 terms of an arithmetic series is \(70\), and the sum of the first 10 terms of this arithmetic series is \(210\), we need to determine the first term \(a\) of the series. We are to show that \(a = \frac{42}{5}\).
  1. The sum of the first 5 terms of an arithmetic series is given by:
     \[
     \sum_{k=0}^{4} (a + kd) = 70
     \]
  2. The sum of the first 10 terms of an arithmetic series is given by:
     \[
     \sum_{k=0}^{9} (a + kd) = 210
     \]
  3. We can express these sums in terms of the first term \(a\) and the common difference \(d\):
     \[
     a + (a + d) + (a + 2d) + (a + 3d) + (a + 4d) = 70
     \]
     \[
     a + (a + d) + (a + 2d) + (a + 3d) + (a + 4d) + (a + 5d) + (a + 6d) + (a + 7d) + (a + 8d) + (a + 9d) = 210
     \]
  4. Simplifying these equations, we get:
     \[
     5a + 10d = 70
     \]
     \[
     10a + 45d = 210
     \]
  5. Solving these equations simultaneously, we find:
     \[
     a + 2d = 14
     \]
     \[
     2a + 9d = 42
     \]
  6. Solving these two equations, we get:
     \[
     a = \frac{42}{5}
     \]
