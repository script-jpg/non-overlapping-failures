  Given the sum of the first 5 terms of an arithmetic series is 70, and the sum of the first 10 terms of this arithmetic series is 210, we need to find the first term \( a \) of the series. We start by expressing the sums using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
  The sum of the first 5 terms is:
  \[ S_5 = a + (a + d) + (a + 2d) + (a + 3d) + (a + 4d) \]
  \[ S_5 = 5a + 10d \]
  Given \( S_5 = 70 \), we have:
  \[ 5a + 10d = 70 \]
  \[ a + 2d = 14 \]
  The sum of the first 10 terms is:
  \[ S_{10} = a + (a + d) + (a + 2d) + \cdots + (a + 9d) \]
  \[ S_{10} = 10a + 45d \]
  Given \( S_{10} = 210 \), we have:
  \[ 10a + 45d = 210 \]
  \[ 2a + 9d = 42 \]
  We now have a system of linear equations:
  1. \( a + 2d = 14 \)
  2. \( 2a + 9d = 42 \)
  To solve for \( a \), we can use these equations. First, solve the first equation for \( a \):
  \[ a = 14 - 2d \]
  Substitute \( a = 14 - 2d \) into the second equation:
  \[ 2(14 - 2d) + 9d = 42 \]
  \[ 28 - 4d + 9d = 42 \]
  \[ 28 + 5d = 42 \]
  \[ 5d = 14 \]
  \[ d = \frac{14}{5} \]
  Now substitute \( d = \frac{14}{5} \) back into \( a = 14 - 2d \):
  \[ a = 14 - 2 \left( \frac{14}{5} \right) \]
  \[ a = 14 - \frac{28}{5} \]
  \[ a = \frac{70}{5} - \frac{28}{5} \]
  \[ a = \frac{42}{5} \]
  Thus, the first term \( a \) is \( \frac{42}{5} \).
