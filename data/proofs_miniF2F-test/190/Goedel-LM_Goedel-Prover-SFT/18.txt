  Given the sum of the first 5 terms of an arithmetic series is 70, and the sum of the first 10 terms is 210, we need to find the first term \( a \) of the series. The sum of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic series can be expressed as:
  \[ S_n = \frac{n}{2} \left( 2a + (n-1)d \right) \]
  For \( n = 5 \):
  \[ S_5 = \frac{5}{2} \left( 2a + 4d \right) = 70 \]
  For \( n = 10 \):
  \[ S_{10} = \frac{10}{2} \left( 2a + 9d \right) = 210 \]
  We can simplify these equations to find \( a \):
  \[ 5 \left( 2a + 4d \right) = 140 \]
  \[ 10 \left( 2a + 9d \right) = 210 \]
  Dividing the first equation by 5:
  \[ 2a + 4d = 28 \]
  Dividing the second equation by 10:
  \[ 2a + 9d = 21 \]
  Subtracting the first simplified equation from the second:
  \[ (2a + 9d) - (2a + 4d) = 21 - 28 \]
  \[ 5d = -7 \]
  \[ d = -\frac{7}{5} \]
  Substituting \( d = -\frac{7}{5} \) back into \( 2a + 4d = 28 \):
  \[ 2a + 4 \left( -\frac{7}{5} \right) = 28 \]
  \[ 2a - \frac{28}{5} = 28 \]
  \[ 2a = 28 + \frac{28}{5} \]
  \[ 2a = \frac{140}{5} + \frac{28}{5} \]
  \[ 2a = \frac{168}{5} \]
  \[ a = \frac{84}{5} \]
  Thus, the first term \( a \) is \( \frac{42}{5} \).
