  Given the sum of the first 5 terms of an arithmetic series is 70, and the sum of the first 10 terms of this arithmetic series is 210, we need to find the first term of the series.
  The sum of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic series can be expressed as:
  \[ S_n = \frac{n}{2} \left( 2a + (n-1)d \right) \]
  For \( n = 5 \):
  \[ S_5 = \frac{5}{2} \left( 2a + 4d \right) = 70 \]
  For \( n = 10 \):
  \[ S_{10} = \frac{10}{2} \left( 2a + 9d \right) = 210 \]
  We can simplify these equations:
  \[ 2a + 4d = 28 \]
  \[ 2a + 9d = 42 \]
  Subtracting the first equation from the second:
  \[ (2a + 9d) - (2a + 4d) = 42 - 28 \]
  \[ 5d = 14 \]
  \[ d = \frac{14}{5} \]
  Substituting \( d = \frac{14}{5} \) back into the first equation:
  \[ 2a + 4 \left( \frac{14}{5} \right) = 28 \]
  \[ 2a + \frac{56}{5} = 28 \]
  \[ 2a = 28 - \frac{56}{5} \]
  \[ 2a = \frac{140}{5} - \frac{56}{5} \]
  \[ 2a = \frac{84}{5} \]
  \[ a = \frac{42}{5} \]
  Thus, the first term of the series is \( \frac{42}{5} \).
