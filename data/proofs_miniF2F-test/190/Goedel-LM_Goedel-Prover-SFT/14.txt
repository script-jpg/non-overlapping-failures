  Given the sum of the first 5 terms of an arithmetic series is 70, and the sum of the first 10 terms of this arithmetic series is 210, we need to find the first term of the series and show that it is \(\frac{42}{5}\).
  1. The sum of the first 5 terms of an arithmetic series is given by:
     \[
     \sum_{k=0}^{4} (a + kd) = 70
     \]
  2. The sum of the first 10 terms of an arithmetic series is given by:
     \[
     \sum_{k=0}^{9} (a + kd) = 210
     \]
  3. We can express the sums as:
     \[
     a + (a + d) + (a + 2d) + (a + 3d) + (a + 4d) = 70
     \]
     \[
     a + (a + d) + (a + 2d) + (a + 3d) + (a + 4d) + (a + 5d) + (a + 6d) + (a + 7d) + (a + 8d) + (a + 9d) = 210
     \]
  4. Simplifying the first equation:
     \[
     5a + 10d = 70
     \]
  5. Simplifying the second equation:
     \[
     10a + 45d = 210
     \]
  6. Solving the system of linear equations:
     \[
     5a + 10d = 70
     \]
     \[
     10a + 45d = 210
     \]
  7. Multiply the first equation by 2:
     \[
     10a + 20d = 140
     \]
  8. Subtract the modified first equation from the second equation:
     \[
     (10a + 45d) - (10a + 20d) = 210 - 140
     \]
     \[
     25d = 70
     \]
     \[
     d = \frac{70}{25} = \frac{14}{5}
     \]
  9. Substitute \(d = \frac{14}{5}\) back into the first equation:
     \[
     5a + 10 \left(\frac{14}{5}\right) = 70
     \]
     \[
     5a + 28 = 70
     \]
     \[
     5a = 42
     \]
     \[
     a = \frac{42}{5}
     \]
