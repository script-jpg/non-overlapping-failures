  Given the sum of the first 5 terms of an arithmetic series is 70 and the sum of the first 10 terms of this arithmetic series is 210, we need to determine the first term \( a \).
  The sum of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic series is given by:
  \[ S_n = \frac{n}{2} \left( 2a + (n-1)d \right) \]
  For \( n = 5 \):
  \[ S_5 = \frac{5}{2} \left( 2a + 4d \right) = 70 \]
  For \( n = 10 \):
  \[ S_{10} = \frac{10}{2} \left( 2a + 9d \right) = 210 \]
  We can solve these equations step by step:
  1. Simplify the equations:
  \[ 5 \left( 2a + 4d \right) = 70 \]
  \[ 10 \left( 2a + 9d \right) = 210 \]
  2. Divide the second equation by the first equation:
  \[ \frac{10 \left( 2a + 9d \right)}{5 \left( 2a + 4d \right)} = \frac{210}{70} \]
  \[ \frac{2a + 9d}{2a + 4d} = 3 \]
  3. Cross-multiply to eliminate the fraction:
  \[ 2a + 9d = 3(2a + 4d) \]
  \[ 2a + 9d = 6a + 12d \]
  \[ 9d - 12d = 6a - 2a \]
  \[ -3d = 4a \]
  \[ d = -\frac{4a}{3} \]
  4. Substitute \( d = -\frac{4a}{3} \) back into the first equation:
  \[ 5 \left( 2a + 4 \left( -\frac{4a}{3} \right) \right) = 70 \]
  \[ 5 \left( 2a - \frac{16a}{3} \right) = 70 \]
  \[ 5 \left( \frac{6a - 16a}{3} \right) = 70 \]
  \[ 5 \left( \frac{-10a}{3} \right) = 70 \]
  \[ \frac{-50a}{3} = 70 \]
  \[ -50a = 210 \]
  \[ a = -\frac{210}{50} \]
  \[ a = \frac{42}{5} \]
