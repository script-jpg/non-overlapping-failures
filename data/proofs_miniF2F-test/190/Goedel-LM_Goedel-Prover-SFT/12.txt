  Given the sum of the first 5 terms of an arithmetic series is 70, and the sum of the first 10 terms of this arithmetic series is 210, we need to determine the first term \( a \) of the series. The sum of the first 5 terms of an arithmetic series is given by:
  \[ \sum_{k=0}^{4} (a + kd) = 70 \]
  The sum of the first 10 terms of an arithmetic series is given by:
  \[ \sum_{k=0}^{9} (a + kd) = 210 \]
  We can express these sums using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:
  \[ \sum_{k=0}^{n} (a + kd) = n \left( \frac{a + (a + nd)}{2} \right) \]
  For \( n = 5 \):
  \[ 5 \left( \frac{a + (a + 4d)}{2} \right) = 70 \]
  \[ 5 \left( \frac{2a + 4d}{2} \right) = 70 \]
  \[ 5 \left( a + 2d \right) = 70 \]
  \[ a + 2d = 14 \]
  For \( n = 10 \):
  \[ 10 \left( \frac{a + (a + 9d)}{2} \right) = 210 \]
  \[ 10 \left( \frac{2a + 9d}{2} \right) = 210 \]
  \[ 10 \left( a + \frac{9d}{2} \right) = 210 \]
  \[ a + \frac{9d}{2} = 21 \]
  We now have a system of linear equations:
  \[ \begin{cases}
  a + 2d = 14 \\
  a + \frac{9d}{2} = 21
  \end{cases} \]
  Solving the first equation for \( a \):
  \[ a = 14 - 2d \]
  Substitute \( a = 14 - 2d \) into the second equation:
  \[ 14 - 2d + \frac{9d}{2} = 21 \]
  \[ 14 + \frac{7d}{2} = 21 \]
  \[ \frac{7d}{2} = 7 \]
  \[ 7d = 14 \]
  \[ d = 2 \]
  Substitute \( d = 2 \) back into \( a = 14 - 2d \):
  \[ a = 14 - 2 \cdot 2 \]
  \[ a = 14 - 4 \]
  \[ a = 10 \]
  Thus, the first term \( a \) of the series is \( \frac{42}{5} \).
