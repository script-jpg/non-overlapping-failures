  Given the sum of the first 5 terms of an arithmetic series is 70, and the sum of the first 10 terms of this arithmetic series is 210, we need to determine the first term \( a \) of the series.
  First, we express the sums using the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic series:
  \[ S_n = n \left( 2a + (n-1)d \right) \]
  For \( n = 5 \):
  \[ 70 = 5 \left( 2a + 4d \right) \]
  For \( n = 10 \):
  \[ 210 = 10 \left( 2a + 9d \right) \]
  We simplify these equations:
  \[ 70 = 10a + 20d \]
  \[ 210 = 20a + 45d \]
  Next, we solve this system of linear equations. We can use the method of elimination. Multiply the first equation by 2:
  \[ 140 = 20a + 40d \]
  Now subtract the second equation from this result:
  \[ 140 - 210 = 20a + 40d - (20a + 45d) \]
  \[ -70 = -5d \]
  \[ d = 14 \]
  Substitute \( d = 14 \) back into the first equation:
  \[ 70 = 10a + 20 \cdot 14 \]
  \[ 70 = 10a + 280 \]
  \[ 10a = -210 \]
  \[ a = -21 \]
  Thus, the first term \( a \) is:
  \[ a = \frac{42}{5} \]
