  Given an arithmetic series with the first term \( a \) and common difference \( d \), we know the sum of the first five terms is 70 and the sum of the first ten terms is 210. We need to find the first term \( a \).
  First, the sum of the first five terms is:
  \[ \sum_{k=0}^{4} (a + k \cdot d) = 5a + 10d = 70 \]
  Next, the sum of the first ten terms is:
  \[ \sum_{k=0}^{9} (a + k \cdot d) = 10a + 45d = 210 \]
  We can simplify the first equation by dividing by 5:
  \[ a + 2d = 14 \]
  The second equation simplifies to:
  \[ 2a + 9d = 42 \]
  Now, we solve these two equations simultaneously. From the first equation, we have:
  \[ a + 2d = 14 \]
  From the second equation, we have:
  \[ 2a + 9d = 42 \]
  Multiplying the first equation by 2, we get:
  \[ 2a + 4d = 28 \]
  Subtracting this from the second equation:
  \[ (2a + 9d) - (2a + 4d) = 42 - 28 \]
  \[ 5d = 14 \]
  \[ d = \frac{14}{5} \]
  Substituting \( d = \frac{14}{5} \) back into the first equation:
  \[ a + 2 \left( \frac{14}{5} \right) = 14 \]
  \[ a + \frac{28}{5} = 14 \]
  \[ a = 14 - \frac{28}{5} \]
  \[ a = \frac{70}{5} - \frac{28}{5} \]
  \[ a = \frac{42}{5} \]
  Thus, the first term \( a \) is \( \frac{42}{5} \).
