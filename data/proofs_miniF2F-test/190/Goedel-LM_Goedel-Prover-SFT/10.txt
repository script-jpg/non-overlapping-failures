  Given the sum of the first 5 terms of an arithmetic series is 70, and the sum of the first 10 terms of this arithmetic series is 210, we need to find the first term \( a \) of the series. The sum of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic series can be expressed as:
  \[ S_n = \frac{n}{2} \left( 2a + (n-1)d \right) \]
  For \( n = 5 \):
  \[ S_5 = \frac{5}{2} \left( 2a + 4d \right) = 70 \]
  For \( n = 10 \):
  \[ S_{10} = \frac{10}{2} \left( 2a + 9d \right) = 210 \]
  Simplifying these equations:
  \[ \frac{5}{2} \left( 2a + 4d \right) = 70 \]
  \[ 2a + 4d = 28 \]
  \[ \frac{10}{2} \left( 2a + 9d \right) = 210 \]
  \[ 2a + 9d = 42 \]
  We now have a system of linear equations:
  \[ 2a + 4d = 28 \]
  \[ 2a + 9d = 42 \]
  Subtracting the first equation from the second:
  \[ (2a + 9d) - (2a + 4d) = 42 - 28 \]
  \[ 5d = 14 \]
  \[ d = \frac{14}{5} \]
  Substituting \( d = \frac{14}{5} \) back into the first equation:
  \[ 2a + 4 \left( \frac{14}{5} \right) = 28 \]
  \[ 2a + \frac{56}{5} = 28 \]
  \[ 2a = 28 - \frac{56}{5} \]
  \[ 2a = \frac{140}{5} - \frac{56}{5} \]
  \[ 2a = \frac{84}{5} \]
  \[ a = \frac{42}{5} \]
  Thus, the first term \( a \) of the series is \( \frac{42}{5} \).
