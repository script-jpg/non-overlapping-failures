      -- The four divisors of a positive integer $m$ with exactly four divisors is $1$, $m$, $p$, and $p \times m$, where $p$ is a prime dividing $m$.  The sum of the divisors is $n = 1 + p + p \times m + m = (p + 1) \times (m + 1).$  So, we have $m = \frac{n - p - 1}{p + 1}$.  We will show that $p$ is a prime not dividing $n$, and so $m$ is indeed an integer.
