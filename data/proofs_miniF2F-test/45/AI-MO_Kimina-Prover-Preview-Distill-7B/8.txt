  -- We observe that the sums of the nice numbers is equal to the sum of the set $S$.
  -- To see this, note that the sum of the nice numbers is equal to the sum of the set

  -- from the sum. The sum of the set $S$ is equal to the sum of the nice numbers
  -- minus the sum of the non-nice numbers, so it is equal to the sum of the nice
  -- numbers, because the non-nice numbers cancel out.

  -- The sum of the set $S$ is equal to the sum of the nice numbers, because the

        -- 2019 \}$. We know that the sum of the numbers in the set $\{ 0, 1, 2, \dots,
        -- 9 \}$ is $45$, so the sum of the numbers in the set $\{ 2000, 2001, 2002, \dots,
        -- 2009 \}$ is $200 \cdot 10 + 45 = 2045$. Also, the sum of the numbers in the set
        -- $\{ 30, 40, 50, \dots, 90 \}$ is $135$, and the sum of the numbers in the set
        -- $\{ 3, 6, 9, \dots, 18 \}$ is $54$. So the sum of the numbers in the set
        -- $\{ 2010, 2011, 2012, \dots, 2019 \}$ is $2045 + 135 + 54 = 2234$.
