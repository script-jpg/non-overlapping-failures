  To solve the problem, we need to find the sum of all nice numbers in the set \(\{2010, 2011, 2012, \dots, 2019\}\). A number \(n\) is nice if there exists a positive integer \(m\) with exactly four positive divisors (including 1 and \(m\)) such that the sum of the four divisors is equal to \(n\).
  First, we define a set \(S\) that contains all such numbers from 2010 to 2019. We then show that the sum of the elements in this set is 2016.

  -- We define S to be the set of all numbers n such that n is in the range [2010, 2019] and there exists a number m with exactly 4 divisors summing to n.
  have h₁ : S = Finset.filter (fun n => 2010 ≤ n ∧ n ≤ 2019 ∧ ∃ m, (Nat.divisors m).card = 4 ∧ (∑ p in Nat.divisors m, p) = n) (Finset.Icc 2010 2019) := by
    ext n
    simp [h₀, Nat.lt_succ_iff]
    -- We use the given condition h₀ to show that n is in S if and only if it satisfies the conditions in the filter function.
    -- Specifically, we need to show that n is between 2010 and 2019 and there exists a number m with exactly 4 divisors summing to n.
    -- The filter function will select numbers that satisfy these conditions.
    omega
  -- We rewrite S using the definition from h₁.
  rw [h₁]
  -- We compute the sum of the elements in the filtered set.
