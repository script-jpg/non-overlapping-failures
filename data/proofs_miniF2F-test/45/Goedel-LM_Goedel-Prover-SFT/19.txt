  To solve the problem, we need to find the sum of all positive integers \( n \) that are nice and lie between 2010 and 2019. A positive integer \( n \) is nice if there exists a positive integer \( m \) with exactly four positive divisors (including 1 and \( m \)) such that the sum of the four divisors is equal to \( n \).
  We will show that the sum of all nice numbers in the set \(\{2010, 2011, 2012, \dots, 2019\}\) is 2016.

  -- We will show that the sum of all nice numbers in the set {2010, 2011, 2012,..., 2019} is 2016.
  have h₁ : S = Finset.filter (fun n ↦ 2010 ≤ n ∧ n ≤ 2019 ∧ ∃ m : ℕ, (Nat.divisors m).card = 4 ∧ (∑ p in Nat.divisors m, p) = n) (Finset.Icc 2010 2019) := by
    ext n
    simp [h₀, Nat.lt_succ_iff, Nat.lt_succ_iff]
    -- We need to show that n is in S if and only if it satisfies the given conditions.
    -- This is done by simplifying the conditions and using the properties of divisors and sums.
    omega
  -- Now we know that S is the set of numbers from 2010 to 2019 that are nice.
  simp_all only [Finset.filter_eq, Finset.sum_filter, Finset.mem_Icc, Finset.mem_filter]
  -- We can simplify the sum of the nice numbers by considering the range and the properties of the divisors.
