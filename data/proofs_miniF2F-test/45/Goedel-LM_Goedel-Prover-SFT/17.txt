  To solve the problem, we need to find the sum of all nice numbers within the set \(\{2010, 2011, 2012, \dots, 2019\}\) and show that it equals 2016. A positive integer \(n\) is nice if there exists a positive integer \(m\) with exactly four positive divisors (including 1 and \(m\)) such that the sum of the four divisors is equal to \(n\).
  Given the constraints and the properties of divisors and sums, we can derive the following:
  1. **Identify the nice numbers**: We need to find numbers \(n\) such that there exists a \(m\) with exactly four divisors and the sum of these divisors equals \(n\).
  2. **Sum the nice numbers**: We need to sum all such numbers within the specified range and verify that the sum equals 2016.
