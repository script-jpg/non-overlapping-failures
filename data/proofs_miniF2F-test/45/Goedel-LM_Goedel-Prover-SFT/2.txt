  To solve the problem, we need to find the sum of all nice numbers in the set \(\{2010, 2011, 2012, \dots, 2019\}\) and show that it equals 2016. A number \(n\) is nice if there exists a positive integer \(m\) with exactly four positive divisors (including 1 and \(m\)) such that the sum of the four divisors is equal to \(n\).
  1. **Identify the nice numbers in the range**: We need to find numbers \(n\) in the range \(\{2010, 2011, 2012, \dots, 2019\}\) that are nice.
  2. **Verify the conditions for each number**: For each \(n\) in the range, check if there exists a \(m\) with exactly four divisors such that the sum of the divisors is \(n\).
  3. **Calculate the sum of the nice numbers**: Once we identify the nice numbers, sum them up and verify that the sum equals 2016.

    -- We need to show that n is in S if and only if it satisfies the given conditions.
    -- This involves checking the range, the number of divisors, and the sum of divisors.
    -- We use the given condition h₀ to define the set S and then filter it based on the conditions.
    -- The filter function will keep only those numbers that meet the criteria.
    -- The Icc function generates the range from 2010 to 2019.
    -- The sum of the divisors of a number is calculated using the divisors function.
    -- The number of divisors is given by the cardinality of the divisors set.
    -- The conditions for a number to be nice are:
    -- 1. The number is between 2010 and 2019.
    -- 2. The number has exactly four divisors.
    -- 3. The sum of the divisors equals the number.
    -- By applying these conditions, we filter the numbers in the range and keep only the nice ones.

  -- Now we rewrite S using the filtered set, where each number in the range is checked against the conditions.
