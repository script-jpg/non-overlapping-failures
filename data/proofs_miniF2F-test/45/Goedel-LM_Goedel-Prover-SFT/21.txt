  To find the sum of all nice numbers in the set \(\{2010, 2011, 2012, \dots, 2019\}\) and show that it is 2016, we need to verify that each number \(n\) in this set is nice. A number \(n\) is nice if there exists a positive integer \(m\) with exactly four positive divisors (including 1 and \(m\)) such that the sum of these divisors equals \(n\).
  Given the set \(\{2010, 2011, 2012, \dots, 2019\}\), we will check each number to see if it satisfies the conditions of being nice. We will then sum these nice numbers and verify that the sum equals 2016.

    -- This involves checking the conditions for each number in the range [2010, 2019].

  -- Now we rewrite S as the filtered set of numbers that satisfy the conditions.
  -- We need to compute the sum of these numbers and verify that it equals 2016.
