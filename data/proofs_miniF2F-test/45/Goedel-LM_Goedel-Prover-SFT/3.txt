  To solve the problem, we need to find all positive integers \( n \) that are nice, meaning there exists a positive integer \( m \) with exactly four positive divisors (including \( 1 \) and \( m \)) such that the sum of the four divisors is equal to \( n \). We then sum these nice numbers within the set \(\{2010, 2011, 2012, \ldots, 2019\}\) and show that the sum is 2016.

  -- We define S to be the set of all nice numbers in the range from 2010 to 2019.
  have h₁ : S = Finset.filter (fun n => 2010 ≤ n ∧ n ≤ 2019 ∧ ∃ m, (Nat.divisors m).card = 4 ∧ (∑ p in Nat.divisors m, p) = n) (Finset.Icc 2010 2019) := by
    ext n
    -- We show that n is in S if and only if it satisfies the conditions in h₀.
    simp [h₀, Finset.mem_Icc]
    -- We need to ensure that n is within the range [2010, 2019].
    -- We need to ensure that there exists an m such that the sum of its divisors is n.
    -- We need to ensure that the number of divisors of m is 4.
    -- We need to ensure that the sum of the divisors of m is n.
    -- Using the omega tactic, we solve the inequalities and logical conditions.

  -- We rewrite S using h₁.
