  To solve the problem, we need to find the sum of all positive integers \( n \) that are nice, where a number is nice if it has exactly four positive divisors (including 1 and \( n \)). We are given that these numbers are between 2010 and 2019.
  Given the conditions:
  1. \( n \) must be between 2010 and 2019.
  2. \( n \) must be a nice number, which means it has exactly four divisors.
  We can use the given properties to filter the numbers in the range and find the sum.

  -- We know the numbers are between 2010 and 2019.
  -- We need to find the sum of all numbers that satisfy the given conditions.
  -- The numbers are nice, so they have exactly 4 divisors, and the sum of the divisors equals the number.
  -- We can use the properties of divisors and the range to find the sum.
