  To solve the problem, we need to find the sum of all nice numbers in the set \(\{2010, 2011, 2012, \dots, 2019\}\). A number \(n\) is nice if there exists a positive integer \(m\) with exactly four positive divisors (including 1 and \(m\)) such that the sum of these divisors equals \(n\).
  First, we need to determine the sum of all nice numbers in the specified range. We will show that the sum of these numbers is 2016.

    simp [h₀, Nat.lt_succ_iff]
    -- We need to show that n is in S if and only if it satisfies the conditions in h₀.
    -- This is equivalent to showing that n is in the range [2010, 2019] and there exists an m such that the sum of its divisors equals n.
