  To find the sum of all the nice numbers in the set \(\{2010, 2011, 2012, \ldots, 2019\}\) and show that it is 2016, we need to verify that each number in the set is nice and then sum these numbers. A number \(n\) is nice if it has exactly four positive divisors, including 1 and \(n\), and the sum of these divisors equals \(n\).
  1. **Range of Numbers**: The numbers in the set are from 2010 to 2019.
  2. **Divisors and Sum**: For each number \(n\) in the set, we need to find a number \(m\) with exactly four divisors such that the sum of these divisors equals \(n\).
  3. **Verification**: We verify that each number in the set meets the criteria of having exactly four divisors and that the sum of these divisors equals \(n\).
  4. **Sum Calculation**: We calculate the sum of all such numbers and check if it equals 2016.

    -- We need to show that n is in the set S if and only if it satisfies the given conditions.
    -- This involves checking if n is within the specified range and if it can be expressed as the sum of exactly four divisors.
    -- We use the fact that n is in the range [2010, 2019] to ensure it is within the specified range.
    -- The conditions for n to be in S are:
    -- 1. 2010 ≤ n ≤ 2019
    -- 2. n has exactly four divisors.
    -- 3. The sum of these divisors equals n.
    -- We use the 'omega' tactic to solve the arithmetic and logical constraints.

  -- Substitute the expression for S into the sum.
