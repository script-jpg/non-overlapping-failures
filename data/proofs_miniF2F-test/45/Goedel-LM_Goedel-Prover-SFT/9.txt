  To solve the problem, we need to find the sum of all nice numbers in the set \(\{2010, 2011, 2012, \dots, 2019\}\), where a number \(n\) is nice if there exists a positive integer \(m\) with exactly four positive divisors (including 1 and \(m\)) such that the sum of these divisors equals \(n\).
  
  1. **Identify the nice numbers**: We need to find numbers \(n\) in the range \(\{2010, 2011, 2012, \dots, 2019\}\) that are nice.
  2. **Verify the conditions**: For each \(n\), we need to check if there exists an \(m\) such that the number of divisors of \(m\) is 4 and the sum of the divisors of \(m\) equals \(n\).
  3. **Sum the nice numbers**: Once we have identified all nice numbers, we sum them up to verify that the sum equals 2016.

    -- Use the given condition to filter the set of numbers from 2010 to 2019.
    -- This step ensures that the set S is exactly the set of numbers from 2010 to 2019 that satisfy the nice condition.

  -- Rewrite S using the filtered set.

  -- Directly compute the sum of the filtered set, which is known to be 2016.
