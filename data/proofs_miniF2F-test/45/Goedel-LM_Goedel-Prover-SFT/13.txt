  To solve the problem, we need to find the sum of all nice numbers in the set \(\{2010, 2011, 2012, \dots, 2019\}\) and show that it equals 2016. A number \(n\) is nice if there exists a positive integer \(m\) with exactly four positive divisors (including 1 and \(m\)) such that the sum of these divisors equals \(n\).
  Given the set \(\{2010, 2011, 2012, \dots, 2019\}\), we need to verify that the sum of all such numbers is indeed 2016. This involves checking each number in the range to ensure it meets the criteria of having exactly four divisors and summing to the number itself.

    -- Use the properties of the filter function to apply the given conditions to the set S.
    -- This step ensures that the set S is correctly defined as the set of numbers that meet the criteria.

  -- Rewrite the sum over the set S using the definition of S from h₁.
