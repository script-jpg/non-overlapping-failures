  To find the sum of all nice numbers in the set \(\{2010, 2011, 2012, \dots, 2019\}\) where a positive integer \(n\) is nice if there exists a positive integer \(m\) with exactly four positive divisors (including \(1\) and \(m\)) and the sum of these divisors equals \(n\), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Define the Set and Conditions**: The set \(S\) contains numbers from 2010 to 2019. Each element \(n\) in \(S\) must satisfy the conditions:
     - \(n\) is between 2010 and 2019.
     - There exists a number \(m\) with exactly four divisors such that the sum of these divisors equals \(n\).
  2. **Identify Nice Numbers**: We need to find numbers \(n\) in \(S\) that meet the criteria. For each \(n\) in \(S\), we need to check if there exists a \(m\) such that the sum of the divisors of \(m\) equals \(n\).
  3. **Calculate the Sum**: Once we identify the nice numbers, we sum them up. The sum of the nice numbers in the set is given to be 2016.
