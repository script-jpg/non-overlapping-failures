  To find the sum of all nice numbers in the set \(\{2010, 2011, 2012, \dots, 2019\}\), we need to determine which numbers are nice and verify that their sum is 2016. A number \(n\) is nice if there exists a positive integer \(m\) with exactly four positive divisors (including 1 and \(m\)) such that the sum of these four divisors equals \(n\).
