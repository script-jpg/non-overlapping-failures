  To solve the problem, we need to find the sum of all nice numbers in the set \(\{2010, 2011, 2012, \ldots, 2019\}\) and show that it equals 2016. A number \(n\) is nice if there exists a positive integer \(m\) with exactly four positive divisors (including 1 and \(m\)) such that the sum of these four divisors equals \(n\).
  Given the set \(\{2010, 2011, 2012, \ldots, 2019\}\), we need to verify that the sum of all such numbers is 2016. This involves checking each number in the set to ensure it meets the criteria for being nice and then summing these numbers.

    -- We need to show that n is in the set S if and only if it satisfies the conditions in the filter.
    -- This involves checking the conditions for n to be in the set.

  -- Now we rewrite the sum over S using the set filter.
