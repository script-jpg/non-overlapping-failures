  To solve the problem, we need to find the sum of all nice numbers in the set \(\{2010, 2011, 2012, \ldots, 2019\}\). We are given that a number \(n\) is nice if there exists a positive integer \(m\) with exactly four positive divisors (including 1 and \(m\)) such that the sum of the four divisors is equal to \(n\).
  We will show that the sum of all nice numbers in the specified set is 2016.
