  Given a nonnegative real number \( x \), let \( \langle x \rangle \) denote the fractional part of \( x \); that is, \( \langle x \rangle = x - \lfloor x \rfloor \), where \( \lfloor x \rfloor \) denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to \( x \). Suppose that \( a \) is positive, \( \langle a^{-1} \rangle = \langle a^2 \rangle \), and \( 2 < a^2 < 3 \). We need to find the value of \( a^{12} - 144a^{-1} \) and show that it is 233.
