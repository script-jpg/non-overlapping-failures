  Given a nonnegative real number \( x \), let \(\langle x \rangle\) denote the fractional part of \( x \); that is, \(\langle x \rangle = x - \lfloor x \rfloor\), where \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to \( x \). Suppose that \( a \) is positive, \(\langle a^{-1} \rangle = \langle a^2 \rangle\), and \( 2 < a^2 < 3 \). We need to find the value of \( a^{12} - 144a^{-1} \) and show that it is 233.
