  Given a nonnegative real number \( x \), let \(\langle x \rangle\) denote the fractional part of \( x \); that is, \(\langle x \rangle = x - \lfloor x \rfloor\), where \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to \( x \). Suppose that \( a \) is positive, \(\langle a^{-1} \rangle = \langle a^2 \rangle\), and \( 2 < a^2 < 3 \). We need to find the value of \( a^{12} - 144a^{-1} \) and show that it is 233.

  have h₄ : a ^ 2 = 1 + Int.fract (a ^ 2) := by
    -- We need to show that a^2 is equal to 1 plus its fractional part.
    -- This is a straightforward application of the definition of the fractional part.

  have h₅ : a ^ 12 = 1 + 12 * Int.fract (a ^ 2) + 66 * Int.fract (a ^ 2) ^ 2 + 165 * Int.fract (a ^ 2) ^ 3 + 182 * Int.fract (a ^ 2) ^ 4 + 116 * Int.fract (a ^ 2) ^ 5 + 30 * Int.fract (a ^ 2) ^ 6 + 3 * Int.fract (a ^ 2) ^ 7 + Int.fract (a ^ 2) ^ 8 := by
    -- We need to show that a^12 is equal to 1 plus 12 times the fractional part of a^2 plus 66 times the square of the fractional part of a^2 plus 165 times the cube of the fractional part of a^2 plus 182 times the fourth power of the fractional part of a^2 plus 116 times the fifth power of the fractional part of a^2 plus 30 times the sixth power of the fractional part of a^2 plus 3 times the seventh power of the fractional part of a^2 plus the eighth power of the fractional part of a^2.
    -- This is a direct computation using the properties of the fractional part and the given conditions.
    nlinarith [h₁]
  -- Using the above results, we can compute the value of a^12 - 144a⁻¹.
