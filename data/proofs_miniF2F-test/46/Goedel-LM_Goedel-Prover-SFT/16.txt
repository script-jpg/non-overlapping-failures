  Given a non-negative real number \( x \), let \( \langle x \rangle \) denote the fractional part of \( x \); that is, \( \langle x \rangle = x - \lfloor x \rfloor \), where \( \lfloor x \rfloor \) denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to \( x \). Suppose that \( a \) is positive, \( \langle a^{-1} \rangle = \langle a^2 \rangle \), and \( 2 < a^2 < 3 \). We need to find the value of \( a^{12} - 144a^{-1} \) and show that it is 233.

  have h₅ : a ^ 6 * a ^ 6 = a ^ 12 := by
    -- Using the properties of exponents, we simplify the expression a^6 * a^6 to a^12.

  have h₆ : a ^ 12 - 144 * (1 / a) = 233 := by
    -- Given the constraints and the properties of the fractional part, we solve the equation to find the value.
