-- Solving the System of Equations

  -- From h₀: 3a = b + c + d
  -- From h₁: 4b = a + c + d
  -- From h₂: 2c = a + b + d

  -- Rearrange h₀: b + c + d = 3a
  -- Rearrange h₁: a + c + d = 4b
  -- Rearrange h₂: a + b + d = 2c

  -- Add all three equations:
  -- (b + c + d) + (a + c + d) + (a + b + d) = 3a + 4b + 2c
  -- 2a + 2b + 2c + 3d = 3a + 4b + 2c
  -- Simplify: 2a + 2b + 2c + 3d = 3a + 4b + 2c
  -- Further simplify: 3d = a + 2b
  -- From this, we get: d = (a + 2b) / 3

  -- Using h₃: 8a + 10b + 6c = 24
  -- From h₀: b + c + d = 3a => c = 3a - b - d
  -- Substitute into h₃: 8a + 10b + 6(3a - b - d) = 24
  -- Expand: 8a + 10b + 18a - 6b - 6d = 24
  -- Combine like terms: 26a + 4b - 6d = 24
  -- From h₀: d = (a + 2b) / 3
  -- Substitute: 26a + 4b - 6((a + 2b) / 3) = 24
  -- Simplify: 26a + 4b - 2(a + 2b) = 24
  -- Further simplify: 26a + 4b - 2a - 4b = 24
  -- Result: 24a = 24
  -- Therefore: a = 1

  -- Substitute a = 1 into h₀: 3(1) = b + c + d => b + c + d = 3
  -- From h₁: 4b = 1 + c + d
  -- From h₂: 2c = 1 + b + d

  -- From h₁: 4b = 1 + c + d
  -- From h₀: b + c + d = 3 => c + d = 3 - b
  -- Substitute into h₁: 4b = 1 + (3 - b)
  -- Simplify: 4b = 1 + 3 - b
  -- Result: 4b = 4 - b
  -- Therefore: 5b = 4
  -- So: b = 4/5

  -- Substitute b = 4/5 into h₀: 3a = b + c + d => 3 = 4/5 + c + d
  -- From h₁: 4(4/5) = 1 + c + d => 16/5 = 1 + c + d
  -- From h₂: 2c = 1 + 4/5 + d => 2c = 9/5 + d

  -- Solve for c and d using h₁ and h₂:
  -- 16/5 = 1 + c + d => c + d = 16/5 - 5/5 = 11/5
  -- 2c = 9/5 + d => d = 2c - 9/5

  -- Substitute d = 2c - 9/5 into c + d = 11/5:
  -- c + (2c - 9/5) = 11/5
  -- 3c - 9/5 = 11/5
  -- 3c = 20/5 = 4 => c = 4/3

  -- Substitute c = 4/3 into d = 2c - 9/5:
  -- d = 2(4/3) - 9/5 = 8/3 - 9/5 = 40/15 - 27/15 = 13/15

  -- Therefore, d = 13/15

  -- The sum of the numerator and denominator is 13 + 15 = 28
