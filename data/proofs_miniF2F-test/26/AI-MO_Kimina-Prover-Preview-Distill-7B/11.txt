-- Solving the System of Equations

  -- From h₀: 3a = b + c + d
  -- From h₁: 4b = a + c + d
  -- From h₂: 2c = a + b + d

  -- Subtracting h₀ from h₁: 4b - 3a = (a + c + d) - (b + c + d) = a - b
  -- Therefore: 4b - 3a = a - b
  -- Simplifying: 5b = 4a
  -- So: b = (4/5)a

  -- Subtracting h₁ from h₂: 2c - 4b = (a + b + d) - (a + c + d) = b - c
  -- Therefore: 2c - 4b = b - c
  -- Simplifying: 3c = 5b
  -- So: c = (5/3)b

  -- Substituting b = (4/5)a into c = (5/3)b: c = (5/3)(4/5)a = (4/3)a

  -- Now, let's substitute b = (4/5)a and c = (4/3)a into h₃: 8a + 10b + 6c = 24
  -- 8a + 10(4/5)a + 6(4/3)a = 24
  -- 8a + 8a + 8a = 24
  -- 24a = 24
  -- a = 1

  -- Substituting a = 1: 
  -- b = (4/5) * 1 = 4/5
  -- c = (4/3) * 1 = 4/3

  -- From h₀: 3a = b + c + d
  -- 3 * 1 = 4/5 + 4/3 + d
  -- 3 = 4/5 + 4/3 + d
  -- d = 3 - 4/5 - 4/3 = 3 - 12/15 - 20/15 = 3 - 32/15 = 45/15 - 32/15 = 13/15

  -- The fraction 13/15 is already in simplest form. The sum of the numerator and denominator is 13 + 15 = 28.
