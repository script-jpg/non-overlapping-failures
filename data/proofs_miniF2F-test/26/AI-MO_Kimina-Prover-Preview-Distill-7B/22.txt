  -- From h₀: 3a = b + c + d
  -- From h₁: 4b = a + c + d
  -- From h₂: 2c = a + b + d

  -- Subtracting h₀ from h₁:
  -- 4b - 3a = (a + c + d) - (b + c + d)
  -- 4b - 3a = a - b
  -- 4b + b = a + 3a
  -- 5b = 4a
  -- b = (4/5)a

  -- Subtracting h₀ from h₂:
  -- 2c - 3a = (a + b + d) - (b + c + d)
  -- 2c - 3a = a - c
  -- 2c + c = 3a + a
  -- 3c = 4a
  -- c = (4/3)a

  have eq2 : c = (4/3) * a := by
    linarith

  -- Substituting b = (4/5)a and c = (4/3)a into h₃: 8a + 10b + 6c = 24
  -- 8a + 10*(4/5)a + 6*(4/3)a = 24
  -- 8a + 8a + 8a = 24
  -- 24a = 24
  -- a = 1

  -- Calculating the values of b, c, and d using the value of a

  have eq5 : c = (4/3) := by

  -- From h₀: 3a = b + c + d
  -- 3*1 = (4/5) + (4/3) + d
  -- 3 = (4/5) + (4/3) + d
  -- 3 = (12/15) + (20/15) + d
  -- 3 = (32/15) + d
  -- d = 3 - (32/15)
  -- d = (45/15) - (32/15)
  -- d = (13/15)

  -- Calculating the sum of the numerator and the denominator of d

  -- The fraction (13/15) is already in its simplest form, so the sum of the numerator and the denominator is 13 + 15 = 28.
