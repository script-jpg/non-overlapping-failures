-- Solving the System of Equations

  -- From h₀: 3a = b + c + d
  -- From h₁: 4b = a + c + d
  -- From h₂: 2c = a + b + d

  -- We can solve these equations manually to find the values of a, b, c, and d

  -- Subtract h₀ from h₁: 4b - 3a = (a + c + d) - (b + c + d) => 4b - 3a = a - b => 5b = 4a => b = (4/5)a
  have hba : b = (4/5) * a := by
    linarith

  -- Subtract h₀ from h₂: 2c - 3a = (a + b + d) - (b + c + d) => 2c - 3a = a - c => 3c = 4a => c = (4/3)a
  have hca : c = (4/3) * a := by
    linarith

  -- Substitute b and c in h₃: 8a + 10*(4/5)a + 6*(4/3)a = 24
  -- => 8a + 8a + 8a = 24 => 24a = 24 => a = 1
  have ha : a = 1 := by
    rw [hba, hca] at h₃
    linarith

  -- Now we can find the values of b, c, and d
  have hb : b = (4/5) := by
    rw [ha] at hba
    linarith

  have hc : c = (4/3) := by
    rw [ha] at hca
    linarith

  -- From h₀: 3a = b + c + d => 3*1 = (4/5) + (4/3) + d => 3 = (4/5) + (4/3) + d
  -- Convert to common denominator: 3 = (12/15) + (20/15) + d => 3 = (32/15) + d => d = 3 - (32/15) = (45/15) - (32/15) = 13/15
  have hd : d = 13 / 15 := by
    rw [ha, hb, hc] at h₀
    linarith

  -- The final answer is the sum of the numerator and denominator of d, which is 13/15
  -- So we need to show that the sum of numerator and denominator of 13/15 is 28
  -- In Lean, this can be done by converting d to a rational number and using the properties of numerator and denominator
