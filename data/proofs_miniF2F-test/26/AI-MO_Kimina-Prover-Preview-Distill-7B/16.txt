-- Solving the System of Equations in the Fraction Field

  field_simp

  -- Express All Variables in Terms of a

  have h₄ : b = (4 / 3) * a := by linarith
  have h₅ : c = 2 * a := by linarith
  have h₆ : d = (17 / 3) * a := by linarith

  -- Substitute into the Last Equation

  rw [h₄, h₅, h₆] at h₃
  field_simp at h₃
  norm_num at h₃

  -- Solve for a

  have h₇ : a = 3 := by linarith

  -- Simplify the Result

  subst h₇
  field_simp
  norm_num
  linarith
