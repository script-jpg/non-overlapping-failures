-- Solving the System of Equations

  -- From h₀: 3a = b + c + d
  -- From h₁: 4b = a + c + d
  -- From h₂: 2c = a + b + d

  -- Subtracting equations:
  -- 3a - 4b = (b + c + d) - (a + c + d) = b - a
  -- 3a - 2c = (b + c + d) - (a + b + d) = c - a
  -- 4b - 2c = (a + c + d) - (a + b + d) = c - b

  -- From h₃: 8a + 10b + 6c = 24

  -- We can solve this system using rational arithmetic:

  have ha : a = 12 / 11 := by
    linarith

  have hb : b = 8 / 11 := by
    linarith

  have hc : c = 6 / 11 := by
    linarith

  have hd : d = 28 / 11 := by
    linarith

  -- Proving that the sum of the numerator and denominator of David's time is 28
