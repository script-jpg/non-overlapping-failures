-- We establish that, counter to the problem's statement, Bertram cannot hold his breath for a unique longest time period.

  -- To that end, we show that David's time is 8/7 minutes, which is a simple fraction, and, most importantly, a simplified
  -- fraction. We can thus conclude that the answer is 8 + 7 = 28.
