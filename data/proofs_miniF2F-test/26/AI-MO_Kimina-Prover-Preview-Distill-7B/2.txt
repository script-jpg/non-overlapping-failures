-- Solving the system of linear equations

  -- From h₀: 3a = b + c + d
  -- From h₁: 4b = a + c + d
  -- From h₂: 2c = a + b + d

  -- We can solve these equations to find the relationships between a, b, c, and d.

  -- Subtract h₀ from h₁: 4b - 3a = (a + c + d) - (b + c + d) => 4b - 3a = a - b
  -- => 4b + b = a + 3a => 5b = 4a => b = 4/5 a
  have h0 : b = 4 / 5 * a := by
    linarith

  -- Subtract h₁ from h₂: 2c - 4b = (a + b + d) - (a + c + d) => 2c - 4b = b - c
  -- => 2c + c = 4b + b => 3c = 5b => c = 5/3 b = 5/3 (4/5 a) = 4/3 a
  have h1 : c = 4 / 3 * a := by
    linarith

  -- From h₀: 3a = b + c + d => 3a = 4/5 a + 4/3 a + d
  -- Convert to common denominator: 3a = 12/15 a + 20/15 a + d => 3a = 32/15 a + d
  -- => d = 3a - 32/15 a = 45/15 a - 32/15 a = 13/15 a
  have h2 : d = 13 / 15 * a := by
    linarith

  -- From h₃: 8a + 10b + 6c = 24
  -- Substitute b = 4/5 a and c = 4/3 a
  -- 8a + 10(4/5 a) + 6(4/3 a) = 24
  -- 8a + 8a + 8a = 24 => 24a = 24 => a = 1
  have ha : a = 1 := by
    have : 8 * a + 10 * (4 / 5 * a) + 6 * (4 / 3 * a) = 24 := by

  -- Simplify the fraction 13/15 is already in simplest form since 13 and 15 are coprime
  -- Therefore, numerator is 13 and denominator is 15
  -- Sum of numerator and denominator: 13 + 15 = 28
