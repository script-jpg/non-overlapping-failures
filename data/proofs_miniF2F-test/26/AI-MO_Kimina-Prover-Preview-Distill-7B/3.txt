-- Solving the System of Equations

  -- From h₀: 3 * a = b + c + d
  -- From h₁: 4 * b = a + c + d
  -- From h₂: 2 * c = a + b + d

  -- We can solve this system of equations to find the values of a, b, c, and d

  -- Subtract h₀ from h₁: 4 * b - 3 * a = (a + c + d) - (b + c + d)
  -- Simplifying: 4 * b - 3 * a = a + c + d - b - c - d
  -- 4 * b - 3 * a = a - b - (d - d)
  -- 4 * b - 3 * a = a - b
  -- 4 * b + b = a + 3 * a
  -- 5 * b = 4 * a
  -- b = (4/5) * a
