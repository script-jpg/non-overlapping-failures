  Given the conditions:
  1. \( b + c + d = 3a \)
  2. \( a + c + d = 4b \)
  3. \( a + b + d = 2c \)
  4. \( 8a + 10b + 6c = 24 \)
  We need to find the sum of the numerator and the denominator of \( d \) when expressed as a simplified fraction.
  First, we solve the system of equations to find the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).
  From the first equation, we can express \( d \) in terms of \( a \) and \( b \):
  \[ d = 3a - b - c \]
  Substitute \( d \) into the second equation:
  \[ a + c + (3a - b - c) = 4b \]
  \[ 4a = 4b \]
  \[ a = b \]
  Substitute \( a = b \) into the third equation:
  \[ a + a + d = 2c \]
  \[ 2a + d = 2c \]
  \[ d = 2c - 2a \]
  Substitute \( d = 2c - 2a \) into the fourth equation:
  \[ 8a + 10a + 6c = 24 \]
  \[ 18a + 6c = 24 \]
  \[ 3a + c = 4 \]
  \[ c = 4 - 3a \]
  Now substitute \( c = 4 - 3a \) back into \( d = 2c - 2a \):
  \[ d = 2(4 - 3a) - 2a \]
  \[ d = 8 - 6a - 2a \]
  \[ d = 8 - 8a \]
  Given \( d \) must be a positive integer, we solve for \( a \):
  \[ 8 - 8a > 0 \]
  \[ 1 > a \]
  Since \( a \) is the smallest positive integer, \( a = 1 \).
  Substitute \( a = 1 \) back into the equations for \( b \), \( c \), and \( d \):
  \[ c = 4 - 3 \cdot 1 = 1 \]
  \[ b = a = 1 \]
  \[ d = 8 - 8 \cdot 1 = 3 \]
  Thus, the values are \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1 \), \( c = 1 \), and \( d = 3 \).
  Finally, we calculate the sum of the numerator and the denominator of \( d \):
  \[ d = 3 \]
  \[ d.num = 3 \]
  \[ d.den = 1 \]
  \[ d.num + d.den = 3 + 1 = 4 \]
