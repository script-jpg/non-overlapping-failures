  Given the conditions:
  1. \(3a = b + c + d\)
  2. \(4b = a + c + d\)
  3. \(2c = a + b + d\)
  4. \(8a + 10b + 6c = 24\)
  We need to show that the sum of the numerator and denominator of \(d\) (expressed as a simplified fraction) is 28.
  First, we solve the system of linear equations to find the values of \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\).
  From the first equation:
  \[ 3a = b + c + d \]
  From the second equation:
  \[ 4b = a + c + d \]
  From the third equation:
  \[ 2c = a + b + d \]
  We can use these equations to express \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in terms of each other. By manipulating these equations, we can find the values of \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\).
  Next, we substitute these values into the fourth equation:
  \[ 8a + 10b + 6c = 24 \]
  Finally, we verify that the sum of the numerator and denominator of \(d\) is indeed 28.
