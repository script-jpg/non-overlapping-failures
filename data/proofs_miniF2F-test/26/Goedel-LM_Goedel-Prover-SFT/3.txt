  Given the conditions:
  1. \(3a = b + c + d\)
  2. \(4b = a + c + d\)
  3. \(2c = a + b + d\)
  4. \(8a + 10b + 6c = 24\)
  We need to show that the sum of the numerator and the denominator of \(d\) (when \(d\) is expressed as a simplified fraction) is 28.
  First, we solve for \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) using the given equations. By adding the first and second equations, we can isolate \(a\) and \(b\). Using the third equation, we can further simplify and solve for \(c\). Finally, we substitute back to find \(d\) and verify the sum of the numerator and the denominator.
