  Given the equations involving the times of Anna, Bertram, Carli, and David, we need to solve for the sum of the numerator and denominator of the fraction representing David's time in minutes. The equations are:
  1. \( 3a = b + c + d \)
  2. \( 4b = a + c + d \)
  3. \( 2c = a + b + d \)
  4. \( 8a + 10b + 6c = 24 \)
  We start by manipulating these equations to isolate \( d \). First, we multiply the first equation by 3 to align the coefficients of \( a \) with the other equations. Then, we add the equations together to eliminate \( a \) and \( b \). Finally, we solve for \( d \) by simplifying the resulting equations and finding the sum of its numerator and denominator.
