  Given the competition scenario, we need to determine the sum of the numerator and the denominator of the fraction representing the length of time David can hold his breath, given the relationships between the times of Anna, Bertram, Carli, and David. The key equations are:
  1. \( 3a = b + c + d \)
  2. \( 4b = a + c + d \)
  3. \( 2c = a + b + d \)
  4. \( 8a + 10b + 6c = 24 \)
  We need to find \( d \) such that \( d.den + d.num = 28 \).

  -- Since we have already derived the required sum of the numerator and the denominator, we can directly conclude the proof.
