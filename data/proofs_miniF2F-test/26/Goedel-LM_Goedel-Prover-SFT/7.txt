  Given the conditions:
  1. \( 3a = b + c + d \)
  2. \( 4b = a + c + d \)
  3. \( 2c = a + b + d \)
  4. \( 8a + 10b + 6c = 24 \)
  We need to find the sum of the numerator and the denominator of \( d \) when \( d \) is expressed as a simplified fraction. We will show that this sum is 28.
  First, we solve for \( d \) using the given equations. By manipulating the equations, we can isolate \( d \) and find its value. Finally, we verify that the sum of the numerator and the denominator of \( d \) equals 28.
