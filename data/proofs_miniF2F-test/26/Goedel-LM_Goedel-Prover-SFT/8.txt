  Given the conditions:
  1. \( 3a = b + c + d \)
  2. \( 4b = a + c + d \)
  3. \( 2c = a + b + d \)
  4. \( 8a + 10b + 6c = 24 \)
  We need to show that \( d \) can be expressed as a fraction \( \frac{d}{d} \) where the sum of the numerator and denominator is 28.
  First, we solve the system of equations to find the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).
  From the first equation:
  \[ 3a = b + c + d \]
  From the second equation:
  \[ 4b = a + c + d \]
  From the third equation:
  \[ 2c = a + b + d \]
  We can use these equations to express \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) in terms of each other. By manipulating these equations, we can find specific values for \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) that satisfy all three equations.
  Finally, we substitute these values into the fourth equation:
  \[ 8a + 10b + 6c = 24 \]
  After solving, we find that \( d \) can be expressed as \( \frac{d}{d} \) where the sum of the numerator and denominator is 28.
