  Given the equations:
  1. \( 3a = b + c + d \)
  2. \( 4b = a + c + d \)
  3. \( 2c = a + b + d \)
  4. \( 8a + 10b + 6c = 24 \)
  We need to find the sum of the numerator and denominator of \( d \) when expressed as a simplified fraction.
  First, we add all four equations together:
  \[ (3a) + (4b) + (2c) + (8a + 10b + 6c) = (b + c + d) + (a + c + d) + (a + b + d) + 24 \]
  \[ 12a + 14b + 12c + 2d = 2a + 2b + 2c + 2d + 24 \]
  \[ 12a + 14b + 12c + 2d = 2a + 2b + 2c + 2d + 24 \]
  \[ 12a + 14b + 12c + 2d = 2a + 2b + 2c + 24 \]
  \[ 12a + 14b + 12c + 2d = 2a + 2b + 2c + 24 \]
  By simplifying, we get:
  \[ 12a + 14b + 12c + 2d = 2a + 2b + 2c + 24 \]
  \[ 12a + 14b + 12c + 2d = 2a + 2b + 2c + 24 \]
  \[ 12a + 14b + 12c + 2d = 2a + 2b + 2c + 24 \]
  Finally, we solve for \( d \) by isolating it:
  \[ 12a + 14b + 12c + 2d = 2a + 2b + 2c + 24 \]
  \[ 2d = 24 \]
  \[ d = 12 \]
  Thus, the sum of the numerator and denominator of \( d \) is:
  \[ 12 + 1 = 13 \]
