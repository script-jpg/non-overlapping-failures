  Given the equations:
  1. \( 3a = b + c + d \)
  2. \( 4b = a + c + d \)
  3. \( 2c = a + b + d \)
  4. \( 8a + 10b + 6c = 24 \)
  We need to find the sum of the numerator and denominator of the fraction representing the time David can hold his breath for the longest time.
  First, we solve the system of equations to express \( a \), \( b \), \( c \), and \( d \) in terms of each other. By manipulating these equations, we can isolate \( d \) and find its value.
