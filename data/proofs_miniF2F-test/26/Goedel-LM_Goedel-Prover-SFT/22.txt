  Given the competition scenario, we need to determine the sum of the numerator and denominator of the fraction representing the length of time David can hold his breath. The conditions provided are:
  1. The sum of the times of Bertram, Carli, and David is three times the time Anna can hold her breath.
  2. The sum of the times of Anna, Carli, and David is four times the time Bertram can hold his breath.
  3. The sum of the times of Anna, Bertram, and David is twice the time Carli can hold her breath.
  4. The equation involving the times of Anna, Bertram, and Carli is \(8a + 10b + 6c = 24\), where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are the times of Anna, Bertram, and Carli respectively.
  We are to show that the sum of the numerator and denominator of the fraction for the time David can hold his breath is 28.
