  Given the conditions:
  1. \( 3a = b + c + d \)
  2. \( 4b = a + c + d \)
  3. \( 2c = a + b + d \)
  4. \( 8a + 10b + 6c = 24 \)
  We need to show that \( d.num + d.den = 28 \).
  First, we use the given equations to solve for \( d \). By manipulating the equations, we can isolate \( d \) and find its value.
