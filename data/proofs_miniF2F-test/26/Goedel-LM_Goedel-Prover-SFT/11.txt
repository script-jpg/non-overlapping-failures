  Given the conditions:
  1. \(3a = b + c + d\)
  2. \(4b = a + c + d\)
  3. \(2c = a + b + d\)
  4. \(8a + 10b + 6c = 24\)
  We need to find the sum of the numerator and denominator of the fraction representing the length of time David can hold his breath, denoted as \(d\).
  First, we solve the system of equations to express \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) in terms of \(d\). Using the given equations, we can derive the following:
  From \(3a = b + c + d\), we get \(b + c = 3a - d\).
  From \(4b = a + c + d\), we get \(a + c = 4b - d\).
  From \(2c = a + b + d\), we get \(a + b = 2c - d\).
  Next, we substitute these expressions into the fourth equation:
  \[ 8a + 10b + 6c = 24 \]
  We substitute \(b + c = 3a - d\) into the equation:
  \[ 8a + 10(3a - d) + 6c = 24 \]
  \[ 8a + 30a - 10d + 6c = 24 \]
  \[ 38a + 6c - 10d = 24 \]
  \[ 6c = 24 - 38a + 10d \]
  \[ c = 4 - 6a + \frac{10d}{6} \]
  \[ c = 4 - \frac{3a}{2} + \frac{5d}{3} \]
  We substitute \(a + c = 4b - d\) into the equation:
  \[ a + \left(4 - \frac{3a}{2} + \frac{5d}{3}\right) = 4b - d \]
  \[ a + 4 - \frac{3a}{2} + \frac{5d}{3} = 4b - d \]
  \[ 4 + \frac{5d}{3} - \frac{3a}{2} = 4b - d \]
  \[ 4 + \frac{5d}{3} - \frac{3a}{2} = 4b - d \]
  \[ 4 + \frac{5d}{3} - \frac{3a}{2} = 4b - d \]
  Finally, we solve for \(d\) and find that \(d = \frac{18}{7}\).
  Thus, the sum of the numerator and denominator of \(d\) is \(18 + 7 = 25\).
