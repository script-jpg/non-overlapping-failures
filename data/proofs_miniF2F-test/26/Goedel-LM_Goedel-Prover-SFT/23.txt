  Given the conditions:
  1. \( 3a = b + c + d \)
  2. \( 4b = a + c + d \)
  3. \( 2c = a + b + d \)
  4. \( 8a + 10b + 6c = 24 \)
  We need to show that the sum of the numerator and denominator of \( d \) is 28.
  First, we simplify the given equations by normalizing them and using basic arithmetic operations. By manipulating these equations, we can derive the value of \( d \).
