  Given the conditions:
  1. The sum of the times of Bertram, Carli, and David is three times the time Anna can hold her breath.
  2. The sum of the times of Anna, Carli, and David is four times the time Bertram can hold her breath.
  3. The sum of the times of Anna, Bertram, and David is twice the time Carli can hold her breath.
  4. Eight times the time Anna can hold her breath plus ten times the time Bertram can hold her breath plus six times the time Carli can hold her breath equals two-fifths of an hour.
  We need to find the sum of the numerator and the denominator of the simplified fraction for David's time in minutes.
  From the given conditions, we derive the following equations:
  1. \( 3a = b + c + d \)
  2. \( 4b = a + c + d \)
  3. \( 2c = a + b + d \)
  4. \( 8a + 10b + 6c = 24 \)
  By solving these equations, we find that the time \( d \) that David can hold his breath is \( \frac{4}{3} \) hours. Therefore, the sum of the numerator and the denominator of \( d \) in minutes is \( 4 + 3 = 7 \).
