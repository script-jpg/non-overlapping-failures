  Given the conditions:
  1. The sum of the times for Bertram, Carli, and David is three times the time for Anna.
  2. The sum of the times for Anna, Carli, and David is four times the time for Bertram.
  3. The sum of the times for Anna, Bertram, and David is twice the time for Carli.
  4. The sum of eight times the time for Anna, ten times the time for Bertram, and six times the time for Carli equals two-fifths of an hour.
  We need to find the sum of the numerator and denominator of the fraction representing the time for David in minutes, which shows that the sum is 28.
