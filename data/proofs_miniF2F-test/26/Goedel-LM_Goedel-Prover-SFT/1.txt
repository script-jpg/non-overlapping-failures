  Given the conditions:
  1. If Bertram, Carli, and David sum their times, the resulting sum is three times the length of time that Anna can hold her breath.
  2. If Anna, Carli, and David sum their times, the result is four times Bertram's time period.
  3. If Anna, Bertram, and David sum their times, the result is twice Carli's time.
  4. Eight times Anna's time plus ten times Bertram's time plus six times Carli's time equals two fifths of an hour.
  We need to show that if the length of time that David can hold his breath is expressed in minutes as a simplified fraction, the sum of the numerator and the denominator is 28.

    -- Using the given equations, we can solve for the numerator and denominator of d.
    -- From h₀, we have 3a = b + c + d.
    -- From h₁, we have 4b = a + c + d.
    -- From h₂, we have 2c = a + b + d.
    -- From h₃, we have 8a + 10b + 6c = 144.
    -- We can solve these equations step by step to find the values of a, b, c, and d.
    -- First, solve for a using h₀ and h₁.
    -- Then, solve for b using h₀ and h₁.
    -- Finally, solve for c using h₀ and h₁.
    -- Finally, solve for d using h₀, h₁, and h₂.
    -- Finally, verify that the sum of the numerator and the denominator of d is 28.
