  Given the conditions:
  1. The sum of the times of Bertram, Carli, and David is three times the time Anna can hold her breath.
  2. The sum of the times of Anna, Carli, and David is four times the time Bertram can hold his breath.
  3. The sum of the times of Anna, Bertram, and David is twice the time Carli can hold her breath.
  4. The sum of eight times the time Anna can hold her breath and ten times the time Bertram can hold his breath, plus six times the time Carli can hold her breath equals two fifths of an hour.
  We need to find the sum of the numerator and the denominator of the fraction representing the time David can hold his breath, and show that it is 28.
