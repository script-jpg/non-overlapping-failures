  Given the conditions:
  1. The sum of the times of Bertram, Carli, and David is three times the time Anna can hold her breath.
  2. The sum of the times of Anna, Carli, and David is four times the time Bertram can hold his breath.
  3. The sum of the times of Anna, Bertram, and David is twice the time Carli can hold his breath.
  4. Eight times Anna's time plus ten times Bertram's time plus six times Carli's time equals two fifths of an hour.
  We need to find the sum of the numerator and the denominator of the fraction representing the time David can hold his breath.
  From the given equations, we can derive the following:
  - From \( h₀ \), we have \( b + c + d = 3a \).
  - From \( h₁ \), we have \( a + c + d = 4b \).
  - From \( h₂ \), we have \( a + b + d = 2c \).
  - From \( h₃ \), we have \( 8a + 10b + 6c = 24 \).
  We can solve these equations step by step to find the values of \( a \), \( b \), \( c \), and \( d \).
  First, we solve for \( a \) using \( h₃ \):
  \[ 8a + 10b + 6c = 24 \]
  Next, we use \( h₁ \) and \( h₂ \) to express \( b \) and \( c \) in terms of \( a \):
  \[ b + c + d = 3a \]
  \[ a + c + d = 4b \]
  \[ a + b + d = 2c \]
  We substitute \( b \) and \( c \) into the equation \( 8a + 10b + 6c = 24 \) to solve for \( d \).
  Finally, we find that the sum of the numerator and the denominator of \( d \) is 28.
