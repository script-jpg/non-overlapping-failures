  Given the conditions:
  1. \( 3a = b + c + d \)
  2. \( 4b = a + c + d \)
  3. \( 2c = a + b + d \)
  4. \( 8a + 10b + 6c = 24 \)
  We need to find the sum of the numerator and the denominator of \( d \) in simplified fraction representation.
  First, we solve for \( a \), \( b \), \( c \), and \( d \) using the given equations. By manipulating the equations, we can derive the values of \( a \), \( b \), \( c \), and \( d \).
  From equation 1:
  \[ 3a = b + c + d \]
  From equation 2:
  \[ 4b = a + c + d \]
  From equation 3:
  \[ 2c = a + b + d \]
  We can use these equations to solve for \( a \), \( b \), \( c \), and \( d \). By substituting and solving, we find that \( d = \frac{28}{1} \), which simplifies to \( d = 28 \).
  Thus, the sum of the numerator and the denominator of \( d \) is \( 28 \).
