  To find an integer \( n \) such that \( 0 \leq n < 101 \) and \( 123456 \equiv n \pmod{101} \), we need to determine the remainder when 123456 is divided by 101. We can compute this directly using modular arithmetic.
  1. Compute \( 123456 \mod 101 \):
     \[
     123456 \div 101 = 1222 \text{ remainder } 34
     \]
     Therefore, \( 123456 \equiv 34 \pmod{101} \).
  Thus, the integer \( n \) that satisfies the given conditions is 34.
