  To solve the congruence equation \(123456 \equiv n \pmod{101}\) for \(0 \leq n < 101\), we need to find the integer \(n\) that satisfies this condition. We are given that \(n = 34\) is a solution. To verify this, we check that \(123456 - 34\) is divisible by 101.
  First, we compute \(123456 - 34 = 123422\). We then check if 123422 is divisible by 101:
  \[ 123422 \div 101 = 1221.9999 \]
  Since 1221 is an integer, 123422 is an integer multiple of 101, confirming that \(n = 34\) satisfies the congruence equation.

  -- We know that 123456 - n is divisible by 101.
  have h₂ : 123456 % 101 = 34 := by norm_num
  -- Using the fact that 123456 - n is divisible by 101, we solve for n.
  have h₃ : n = 123456 % 101 := by omega
  -- Simplify the expression to confirm the value of n.
