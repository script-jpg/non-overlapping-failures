  To solve the congruence equation \(123456 \equiv n \pmod{101}\) where \(0 \leq n < 101\), we need to find \(n\) such that \(123456 - n\) is divisible by 101. We start by simplifying the congruence using the properties of modular arithmetic.
  1. **Simplify the congruence**: Given \(123456 \equiv n \pmod{101}\), we can rewrite this as \(123456 - n = 101k\) for some integer \(k\).
  2. **Find \(n\)**: We need \(n\) such that \(123456 - n\) is divisible by 101. This can be done by solving the equation \(123456 - n = 101k\) for some integer \(k\).
  3. **Use the fact that \(123456 \equiv n \pmod{101}\)**: Since \(123456 \equiv n \pmod{101}\), we can use the fact that \(123456 \mod 101\) gives the remainder when 123456 is divided by 101.
  4. **Calculate \(123456 \mod 101\)**: By performing the division, we find that \(123456 \div 101 = 1222\) with a remainder of \(123456 - 1222 \times 101 = 34\).
  5. **Verify \(n = 34\)**: Since \(123456 - 34 = 101 \times 1222\), we have \(n = 34\) satisfies the condition.
