  To solve the problem, we need to find an integer \( n \) that satisfies \( 0 \leq n < 101 \) and \( 123456 \equiv n \pmod{101} \). We will show that \( n = 34 \).
  1. Given \( 101 \mid 123456 - n \), we can write \( 123456 - n = 101k \) for some integer \( k \).
  2. Rearranging, we get \( n = 123456 - 101k \).
  3. Since \( 123456 \equiv 123456 \pmod{101} \), we need to find \( k \) such that \( 123456 - 101k \) is congruent to \( n \) modulo 101.
  4. By solving the congruence \( 123456 \equiv n \pmod{101} \), we find that \( n = 34 \).
