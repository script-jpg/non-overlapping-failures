  To solve for the integer \( n \) that satisfies \( 0 \le n < 101 \) and \( 123456 \equiv n \pmod{101} \), we need to find \( n \) such that \( 123456 - n \) is divisible by 101. We are given that \( n = 34 \) satisfies this condition. The proof involves verifying that \( 123456 - 34 \) is indeed divisible by 101, which can be done by checking the congruence modulo 101.
