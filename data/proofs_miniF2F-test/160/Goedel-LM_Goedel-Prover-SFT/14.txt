  To solve the problem of finding an integer \( n \) such that \( 0 \leq n < 101 \) and \( 123456 \equiv n \pmod{101} \), we need to determine the remainder when \( 123456 \) is divided by \( 101 \).
  First, we compute the remainder of \( 123456 \) when divided by \( 101 \). This can be done by performing the division and finding the remainder.
