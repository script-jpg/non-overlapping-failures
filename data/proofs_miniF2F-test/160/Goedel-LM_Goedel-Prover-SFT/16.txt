  To solve the congruence \( 123456 \equiv n \pmod{101} \) where \( 0 \leq n < 101 \), we need to find \( n \) such that \( 123456 - n \) is divisible by 101. We start by calculating the remainder of \( 123456 \) when divided by 101. We find that \( 123456 \div 101 = 1222 \text{ remainder } 34 \). Therefore, \( 123456 \equiv 34 \pmod{101} \). Thus, the integer \( n \) that satisfies the congruence is \( 34 \).

  -- We need to show that n = 34 given the congruence 123456 ≡ n (mod 101) and the constraints 0 ≤ n < 101.
  -- First, we use the fact that 123456 % 101 = 34 to rewrite the congruence.
