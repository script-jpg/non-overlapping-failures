  To solve the problem, we need to find the integer \( n \) that satisfies \( 0 \leq n < 101 \) and \( 123456 \equiv n \pmod{101} \). We are given that \( n = 34 \). We will verify this by checking the congruence and ensuring \( n \) is within the specified range.

  -- We need to show that n = 34 satisfies the given conditions.
  have h₂ : n = 34 := by
    -- Normalize the congruence condition to ensure it is in the correct form.

    -- Use the omega tactic to solve the linear congruence and range constraints.

  -- The result h₂ shows that n = 34, which matches our expected solution.
