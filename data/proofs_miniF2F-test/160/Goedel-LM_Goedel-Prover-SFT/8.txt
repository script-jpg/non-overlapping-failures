  To solve the congruence \( 123456 \equiv n \pmod{101} \) where \( 0 \le n < 101 \), we need to find \( n \) such that \( 123456 - n \) is divisible by 101. We start by noting that \( 123456 \mod 101 = 34 \). Therefore, \( n \) must be 34 to satisfy the congruence.

  -- We know that 123456 modulo 101 is 34.
  have h₂ : 123456 % 101 = 34 := by norm_num
  -- Rewrite the congruence condition to use the modulo operation.
  rw [← Nat.mod_add_div (123456 - n) 101] at h₁
  -- Simplify the expression to show that n must be 34.
  norm_num at h₁
  -- Use the omega tactic to solve the resulting linear congruence.
