  To solve the congruence \(123456 \equiv n \pmod{101}\) where \(0 \le n < 101\), we need to find the integer \(n\) that satisfies this condition. We start by simplifying the congruence using properties of modular arithmetic.
  1. Given \(123456 \equiv n \pmod{101}\), we can rewrite this as \(123456 - n = 101k\) for some integer \(k\).
  2. We need to find \(n\) such that \(0 \le n < 101\) and \(123456 - n\) is divisible by 101.
  3. Simplifying \(123456 \mod 101\) gives \(123456 \equiv 34 \pmod{101}\).
  4. Therefore, \(n = 34\) is the solution that satisfies the given conditions.
