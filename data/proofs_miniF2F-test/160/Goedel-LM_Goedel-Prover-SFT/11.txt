  To solve the congruence \(123456 \equiv n \pmod{101}\) where \(0 \leq n < 101\), we need to find the integer \(n\) that satisfies this condition. Given that \(101\) divides \(123456 - n\), we can use the properties of divisibility and modular arithmetic to find \(n\).
  1. Start with the congruence \(123456 \equiv n \pmod{101}\).
  2. Rewrite the congruence as \(123456 - n\) being divisible by \(101\).
  3. Use the fact that \(101\) divides \(123456 - n\) to find the exact value of \(n\).
  4. Verify that \(n = 34\) satisfies the congruence and the range \(0 \leq n < 101\).
