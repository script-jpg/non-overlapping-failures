  To find the integer \( n \) that satisfies \( 0 \leq n < 101 \) and \( 123456 \equiv n \pmod{101} \), we need to show that \( n \) is 34. This can be achieved by demonstrating that \( 123456 - n \) is divisible by 101, and \( n \) is the remainder when 123456 is divided by 101.

  -- We start by rewriting the divisibility condition using the modulo operation.
  have h₁' : n = 123456 % 101 := by omega
  -- Simplify the expression to show that n equals 123456 modulo 101.
  norm_num at h₁'
  -- Use the omega tactic to solve the resulting equation.
