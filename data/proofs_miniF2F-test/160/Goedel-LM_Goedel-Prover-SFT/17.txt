  To solve for the integer \( n \) that satisfies \( 0 \leq n < 101 \) and \( 123456 \equiv n \pmod{101} \), we need to find \( n \) such that the congruence holds. This can be done by solving the equation \( 123456 \equiv n \pmod{101} \).
  First, we reduce \( 123456 \) modulo \( 101 \):
  \[ 123456 \div 101 = 1222 \text{ remainder } 34 \]
  Thus,
  \[ 123456 \equiv 34 \pmod{101} \]
  Therefore, \( n = 34 \) satisfies the given congruence.
