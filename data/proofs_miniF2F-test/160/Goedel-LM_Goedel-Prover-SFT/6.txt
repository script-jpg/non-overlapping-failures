  To solve the problem, we need to find an integer \( n \) such that \( 0 \leq n < 101 \) and \( 123456 \equiv n \pmod{101} \). We are given that \( n = 34 \). To verify this, we check that \( 123456 \equiv 34 \pmod{101} \).
  First, we compute the remainder of \( 123456 \) when divided by \( 101 \):
  \[ 123456 \div 101 = 1222 \text{ remainder } 34 \]
  Thus,
  \[ 123456 \equiv 34 \pmod{101} \]
  Next, we verify that \( 34 \) is within the range \( 0 \leq n < 101 \).
  Since \( 34 \) is indeed less than \( 101 \) and satisfies the congruence, we conclude that \( n = 34 \).
