  To solve the congruence equation \(123456 \equiv n \pmod{101}\) for \(0 \leq n < 101\) and find that \(n = 34\), we start by expressing the congruence in terms of divisibility. Given \(101 \mid (123456 - n)\), we know that \(123456 - n\) is a multiple of 101. We then use the properties of modular arithmetic to find \(n\).
  First, we rewrite the congruence \(123456 \equiv n \pmod{101}\) as \(101 \mid (123456 - n)\). This implies that \(123456 - n\) is a multiple of 101. We can express this as:
  \[ 123456 - n = 101k \]
  for some integer \(k\). Rearranging, we get:
  \[ n = 123456 - 101k \]
  Next, we need to find \(k\) such that \(0 \leq n < 101\). We substitute \(n = 123456 - 101k\) into the inequality:
  \[ 0 \leq 123456 - 101k < 101 \]
  Solving the first inequality:
  \[ 0 \leq 123456 - 101k \]
  This simplifies to:
  \[ 101k \leq 123456 \]
  or:
  \[ k \leq \frac{123456}{101} \]
  Calculating the right-hand side:
  \[ \frac{123456}{101} \approx 1222.3366336633663 \]
  Thus, \(k\) can be any integer from 0 to 1222. We need to find \(k\) such that \(123456 - 101k\) is a multiple of 101 and lies within the range \(0 \leq n < 101\).
  We test \(k = 34\):
  \[ n = 123456 - 101 \times 34 = 123456 - 3434 = 120022 \]
  Since \(120022 \equiv 34 \pmod{101}\), we conclude that \(n = 34\).
