  To solve the problem, we need to find an integer \( n \) such that \( 0 \leq n < 101 \) and \( 123456 \equiv n \pmod{101} \). We are given that \( n = 34 \). We will verify that \( 123456 - 34 \) is divisible by 101.
  1. Calculate \( 123456 - 34 = 123422 \).
  2. Check the divisibility of 123422 by 101:
     \[
     123422 \div 101 = 1221 \quad \text{(an integer)}
     \]
     Since 123422 is exactly divisible by 101, we have \( 123422 \equiv 0 \pmod{101} \).
  Thus, \( n = 34 \) satisfies the conditions \( 0 \leq n < 101 \) and \( 123456 \equiv n \pmod{101} \).
