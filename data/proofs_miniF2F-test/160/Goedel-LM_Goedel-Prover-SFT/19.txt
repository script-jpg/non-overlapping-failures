  To solve the problem, we need to find an integer \( n \) such that \( 0 \leq n < 101 \) and \( 123456 \equiv n \pmod{101} \). We are given that \( n = 34 \). We will verify that \( 34 \) satisfies the given congruence condition.
  First, we calculate \( 123456 \mod 101 \). Performing the division, we find that:
  \[ 123456 \div 101 = 1222 \text{ remainder } 34 \]
  Thus, \( 123456 \equiv 34 \pmod{101} \).
  Next, we check that \( 34 \) is within the range \( 0 \leq n < 101 \). Clearly, \( 34 \) satisfies this condition.
  Therefore, the integer \( n \) that satisfies the given conditions is \( 34 \).

  -- First, we show that n ≤ 34.
  -- Since 101 divides (123456 - n), we can use this to bound n.

  -- Next, we show that 34 ≤ n.
  -- This is a direct consequence of the congruence condition.
