  To solve the congruence equation \(123456 \equiv n \pmod{101}\) where \(0 \leq n < 101\), we need to find the integer \(n\) that satisfies this condition. We are given that \(n < 101\) and \(101 \mid (123456 - n)\). This implies that \(123456 - n\) is divisible by 101. We can use this information to solve for \(n\).
  First, we express \(123456\) in terms of its remainder when divided by 101. Since \(123456 \equiv n \pmod{101}\), we can write \(123456 = 101k + n\) for some integer \(k\).
  Next, we use the fact that \(101 \mid (123456 - n)\). This means \(123456 - n\) is divisible by 101. Therefore, we have:
  \[ 123456 - n \equiv 0 \pmod{101} \]
  Since \(n \equiv 0 \pmod{101}\), we have:
  \[ 123456 \equiv n \pmod{101} \]
  Given that \(123456 \equiv 34 \pmod{101}\), we conclude that \(n = 34\).
