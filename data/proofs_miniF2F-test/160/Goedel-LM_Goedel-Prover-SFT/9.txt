  To solve for the integer \( n \) that satisfies \( 0 \leq n < 101 \) and \( 123456 \equiv n \pmod{101} \), we need to find \( n \) such that \( 123456 - n \) is divisible by 101. This can be done by simplifying the congruence condition using properties of modular arithmetic.
  1. Start with the congruence \( 123456 \equiv n \pmod{101} \).
  2. Rewrite this as \( 123456 - n \equiv 0 \pmod{101} \).
  3. Since \( 123456 \equiv 34 \pmod{101} \), we have \( 34 - n \equiv 0 \pmod{101} \).
  4. This implies \( n \equiv 34 \pmod{101} \).
  5. Given \( 0 \leq n < 101 \), the only solution is \( n = 34 \).
