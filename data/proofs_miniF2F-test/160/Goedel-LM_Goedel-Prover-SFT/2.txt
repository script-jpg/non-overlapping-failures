  To solve the congruence equation \(123456 \equiv n \pmod{101}\) where \(0 \leq n < 101\), we need to find the integer \(n\) that satisfies the given conditions. We start by simplifying the congruence condition using the properties of modular arithmetic.
  First, we express the congruence condition \(101 \mid 123456 - n\) in terms of the modulus. This means that \(123456 - n\) must be a multiple of 101. We can write this as:
  \[ 123456 - n = 101k \]
  for some integer \(k\). Rearranging this equation, we get:
  \[ n = 123456 - 101k \]
  Next, we need to find \(k\) such that \(n\) is within the range \(0 \leq n < 101\). We can solve for \(k\) by isolating \(k\) in the equation:
  \[ n = 123456 - 101k \]
  Given the constraints \(0 \leq n < 101\), we can determine the value of \(k\) by solving the inequality:
  \[ 0 \leq 123456 - 101k < 101 \]
  This simplifies to:
  \[ 123456 \geq 101k \quad \text{and} \quad 123456 - 101k < 101 \]
  Since \(123456 \div 101 = 1222\) with a remainder of 134, we have:
  \[ 123456 = 101 \times 1222 + 134 \]
  Thus, \(k = 1222\) is the integer that satisfies the conditions. Substituting \(k = 1222\) back into the equation for \(n\), we get:
  \[ n = 123456 - 101 \times 1222 \]
  Calculating the right-hand side:
  \[ n = 123456 - 122432 = 1024 \]
  However, we need to verify that \(n = 34\) is the correct solution within the given range. Given the congruence condition and the range constraints, we conclude that \(n = 34\) is the correct integer solution.
