  To find the integer \( n \) such that \( 0 \leq n < 101 \) and \( 123456 \equiv n \pmod{101} \), we need to determine \( n \) for which \( 123456 - n \) is divisible by 101. Given that \( 123456 \equiv n \pmod{101} \), we can write \( 123456 = 101k + n \) for some integer \( k \). We need to find \( n \) such that \( 123456 - n \) is a multiple of 101.
  First, we compute the remainder of 123456 when divided by 101:
  \[ 123456 \div 101 = 1222 \text{ remainder } 34 \]
  Thus,
  \[ 123456 = 101 \times 1222 + 34 \]
  This shows that \( 123456 - 34 \) is divisible by 101. Therefore, the integer \( n \) that satisfies the conditions is \( 34 \).
