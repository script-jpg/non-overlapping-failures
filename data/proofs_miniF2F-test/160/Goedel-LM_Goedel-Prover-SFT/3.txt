  To solve the congruence \(123456 \equiv n \pmod{101}\) for \(0 \le n < 101\), we need to find \(n\) such that \(123456 - n\) is divisible by 101. We start by calculating \(123456 \mod 101\).
  1. Compute \(123456 \mod 101\):
     \[
     123456 \div 101 = 1222 \text{ remainder } 34
     \]
     Thus, \(123456 \equiv 34 \pmod{101}\).
  2. Given \(n = 34\), we check that \(123456 - n\) is divisible by 101:
     \[
     123456 - 34 = 123422
     \]
     \[
     123422 \div 101 = 1222 \text{ remainder } 0
     \]
     Therefore, \(123422 \equiv 0 \pmod{101}\), confirming \(n = 34\) satisfies the congruence.
