  To solve the congruence \(123456 \equiv n \pmod{101}\) where \(0 \leq n < 101\), we need to find \(n\) such that \(123456 - n\) is divisible by 101. We start by simplifying the congruence using the properties of modular arithmetic.
  1. Rewrite the congruence \(123456 \equiv n \pmod{101}\) as \(123456 - n \equiv 0 \pmod{101}\).
  2. This implies that \(123456 - n\) must be a multiple of 101.
  3. We need to find \(n\) such that \(123456 - n\) is a multiple of 101.
  4. By performing the division, we find that \(123456 \div 101 = 1222\) with a remainder of 34.
  5. Therefore, \(123456 \equiv 34 \pmod{101}\).
  Thus, the integer \(n\) that satisfies the given conditions is \(34\).
