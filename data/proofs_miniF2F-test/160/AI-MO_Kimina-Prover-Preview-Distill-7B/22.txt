In this proof, we first establish that $123456 - n = 101 \cdot (1222 + \frac{n}{101})$ using the omega solver, which is a powerful tactic for solving integer arithmetic problems. This step is crucial as it sets up the foundation for the subsequent reasoning.

Next, we rewrite the hypothesis h₁ using this equation. This transforms h₁ from stating that $101$ divides $123456 - n$ to stating that $101$ divides $101 \cdot (1222 + \frac{n}{101})$.

Finally, we use omega again to complete the proof. At this point, the tactic can deduce that the only value of $n$ satisfying both $n < 101$ and $101 \mid 123456 - n$ is $n = 34$.

Therefore, the integer $n$ that satisfies $0 \leq n < 101$ and $123456 \equiv n \pmod{101}$ is indeed 34.
