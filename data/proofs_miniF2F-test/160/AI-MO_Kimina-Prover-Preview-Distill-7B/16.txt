The key insight is that we need to find the remainder when 123456 is divided by 101, which will give us the unique integer n that satisfies the given conditions. 

First, let's think about how to compute 123456 mod 101. One approach is to repeatedly subtract multiples of 101 from 123456 until we get a number less than 101. However, this can be tedious for large numbers.

Instead, we can use the fact that 101 is a prime number and apply Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that for any integer $a$ not divisible by $p$ (a prime), $a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{p}$. 

But how does this help us compute the remainder of 123456 modulo 101?

We can express 123456 in terms of powers of 101. Let's break it down:

123456 = 1 × 10^5 + 2 × 10^4 + 3 × 10^3 + 4 × 10^2 + 5 × 10 + 6

Now, we can compute each power of 10 modulo 101:

- 10^1 ≡ 10 (mod 101)
- 10^2 ≡ 100 (mod 101)
- 10^3 ≡ 99 (mod 101) 
- 10^4 ≡ 900 ≡ 900 - 8 × 101 = 900 - 808 = 92 (mod 101)
- 10^5 ≡ 920 ≡ 920 - 9 × 101 = 920 - 909 = 11 (mod 101)

So, 123456 ≡ 1 × 11 + 2 × 92 + 3 × 99 + 4 × 100 + 5 × 10 + 6 (mod 101)

Calculating each term:
- 1 × 11 = 11
- 2 × 92 = 184
- 3 × 99 = 297
- 4 × 100 = 400
- 5 × 10 = 50
- 6

Now, summing these:
11 + 184 + 297 + 400 + 50 + 6 = 1000 + 100 + 6 = 1106

Finally, compute 1106 mod 101:
1106 ÷ 101 ≈ 10.95, so the quotient is 10
1106 - 10 × 101 = 1106 - 1010 = 96

But this doesn't match the expected answer of 34. Let me double-check my calculations.

When computing 10^5 mod 101, I made an error:
10^5 = 10^4 × 10 ≡ 92 × 10 ≡ 920
920 ÷ 101 ≈ 9.109, so the quotient is 9
920 - 9 × 101 = 920 - 909 = 11

So, 10^5 ≡ 11 (mod 101). Let me recalculate the entire expression:

123456 ≡ 1 × 11 + 2 × 92 + 3 × 99 + 4 × 100 + 5 × 10 + 6 (mod 101)
= 11 + 184 + 297 + 400 + 50 + 6 (mod 101)
= 11 + 84 + 97 + 0 + 50 + 6 (mod 101) [since 184 ≡ 84, 297 ≡ 97, 400 ≡ 0]
= 11 + 84 + 97 + 50 + 6 (mod 101)
= 11 + 84 + 97 + 50 + 6 = 258
258 ÷ 101 = 2.554, so the quotient is 2
258 - 2 × 101 = 258 - 202 = 56

This still doesn't match the expected answer of 34. Let me try a different approach.

Instead of breaking down the number, I can compute 123456 mod 101 directly using division:

123456 ÷ 101 = 1222.3366...
The quotient is 1222, so 123456 - 1222 × 101 = 123456 - 123422 = 34

So, 123456 ≡ 34 (mod 101), which is the expected answer.

In Lean, we can compute this directly using `decide`:

```tactics
have h : 123456 % 101 = 34 := by decide
```

This establishes that the remainder of 123456 when divided by 101 is indeed 34. 

Now, let's complete the proof:

```tactics
have : 123456 ≡ n [MOD 101] := by
  rw [Nat.ModEq.comm, Nat.modEq_iff_dvd' (show 0 < 101 by decide)] at *
  omega
```

This shows that 123456 is congruent to n modulo 101 by using the definition of modular equivalence and the fact that 101 divides 123456 - n (given by the hypothesis `h₁`).

Now, we can conclude:

```tactics
rw [(Nat.modEq_iff_dvd' (by decide)).mp this] at *
omega
```

This completes the proof by converting the modular equivalence back to an equality of remainders, and then using `omega` to deduce that n = 34 given that n < 101 and 101 divides 123456 - n.

Therefore, the unique integer n that satisfies the conditions is 34.
