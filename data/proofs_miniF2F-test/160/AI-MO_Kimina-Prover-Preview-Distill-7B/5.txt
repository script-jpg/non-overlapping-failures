The Lean 4 proof is complete. The key insight is that $123456 \equiv 34 \pmod{101}$, which can be verified by computing $123456 \bmod 101$. The Lean proof uses the `omega` tactic, which is powerful for solving integer arithmetic goals. It is able to deduce that $n = 34$ given the constraints $n < 101$ and $101 \mid (123456 - n)$.

The direct computation of $123456 \bmod 101$ reveals that $123456 \equiv 34 \pmod{101}$, which means $n = 34$ is indeed the unique solution in the range $0 \le n < 101$.

Therefore, the integer $n$ that satisfies $0 \le n < 101$ and $123456 \equiv n \pmod{101}$ is $\boxed{34}$.
