  -- We start by computing the remainder of the division of 123456 by 101. Using the fact that 101 is a prime number and applying Fermat's Little Theorem, we know that for any integer $a$ not divisible by 101, $a^{100} \equiv 1 \pmod{101}$. Therefore, $a^{100k+r} \equiv a^r \pmod{101}$.

  -- Let's decompose 123456 as $123456 = 1234 \cdot 100 + 56$. Since $100 \equiv -1 \pmod{101}$, we get $123456 \equiv 1234 \cdot (-1) + 56 \equiv -1234 + 56 \equiv -1178 \pmod{101}$.

  -- Now, we can compute $-1178 \pmod{101}$. Since $1178 = 101 \cdot 11 + 67$, we have $-1178 \equiv -67 \equiv 34 \pmod{101}$.

  -- The theorem is then basically a direct application of the modEq and the division algorithm, but the formalization is a bit complicated because we need to deal with the specific hypotheses.
