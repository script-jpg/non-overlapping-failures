The omega solver is powerful for solving goals involving natural numbers and arithmetic. It is able to deduce that if $101$ divides $123456 - n$ and $n < 101$, then $n$ must be $34$. This is because it can compute $123456 \bmod 101 = 34$ and verify that $34$ is the unique solution in the range $[0, 100]$.

So our complete proof is:

This proof is elegant because the omega tactic is able to compute the value of $123456 \bmod 101$ and verify that it is indeed $34$, while also checking that $34$ is the only number in the range $[0, 100]$ that satisfies the congruence relation. The key insight is that $123456 \equiv 34 \pmod{101}$, which can be verified through direct computation:

1. Compute $123456 \bmod 101$: 
   - $123456 \div 101 \approx 1222.336$, so the quotient is $1222$.
   - $123456 - 1222 \times 101 = 123456 - 123422 = 34$.
   - Therefore, $123456 \equiv 34 \pmod{101}$.

2. Since $0 \leq 34 < 101$, $34$ is the unique solution in the specified range.

Thus, $n = 34$ is the only integer that satisfies both $n < 101$ and $101 \mid 123456 - n$.
