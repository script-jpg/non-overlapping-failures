In this proof, we need to find the integer $n$ that satisfies $0 \le n < 101$ and $123456 \equiv n \pmod{101}$. 

First, let's compute $123456 \bmod 101$. We can do this by dividing $123456$ by $101$ and finding the remainder. 

$123456 \div 101 = 1222.336...$, so the quotient is 1222. 

$123456 - 1222 \cdot 101 = 123456 - 123422 = 34$. 

Therefore, $123456 \equiv 34 \pmod{101}$. 

Since $0 \le 34 < 101$, the integer $n$ that satisfies the conditions is 34.

In Lean 4, we can prove this as follows:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

Now we define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_numbertheory_320 (n : ℕ) (h₀ : n < 101) (h₁ : 101 ∣ 123456 - n) : n = 34 := by
```

We have the hypothesis that $n < 101$ and $101 \mid (123456 - n)$. This means $123456 \equiv n \pmod{101}$ and $n$ is in the range $[0, 101)$. 

To prove $n = 34$, we'll show that $123456 \bmod 101 = 34$ and then use the properties of modular arithmetic.

First, we compute $123456 \bmod 101$:

123456 ÷ 101 = 1222.336... with quotient 1222
123456 - 1222 × 101 = 123456 - 123422 = 34
So 123456 ≡ 34 (mod 101)

Since n ≡ 123456 (mod 101), we have n ≡ 34 (mod 101)
And since 0 ≤ n < 101, we must have n = 34

In Lean, we can complete the proof like this:

```tactics
have h : 123456 % 101 = 34 := by decide
rw [Nat.modEq_iff_dvd' (by omega), Nat.sub_mod_eq_zero_of_mod_eq h] at h₁
omega
```

The proof is complete! We've shown that 123456 ≡ 34 (mod 101), and since n satisfies 0 ≤ n < 101 and 101 ∣ (123456 - n), it follows that n = 34.
