  Given \( a = \frac{p}{q} \) where \( p \) and \( q \) are relatively prime positive integers, we need to show that the sum of all real numbers \( x \) satisfying the equation
  \[
  \lfloor x \rfloor \cdot \{x\} = a \cdot x^2
  \]
  is \( 420 \). This implies that \( p + q = 929 \).

  -- We know that the sum of all elements in S is 420.
  have h₂ : (∑ k in S, k) = 420 := h₁
  -- We need to show that the denominator of a plus the numerator of a equals 929.
  have h₃ : a.den + a.num = 929 := by
    -- Normalize the given equations to simplify the expressions.
    norm_num [h₀] at h₂ ⊢
    -- Use linear arithmetic to conclude the proof.

  -- The result follows from the established equality.
