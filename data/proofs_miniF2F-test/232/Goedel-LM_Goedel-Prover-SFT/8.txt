  Given \( a = \frac{p}{q} \) where \( p \) and \( q \) are relatively prime positive integers, we know that the sum of all real numbers \( x \) satisfying the equation
  \[ \lfloor x \rfloor \cdot \{x\} = a \cdot x^2 \]
  is 420. We need to find \( p + q \).
  To solve this, we start by analyzing the given equation. For \( x \) in the interval \([n, n+1)\), the equation simplifies to:
  \[ n \cdot (x - n) = a \cdot x^2 \]
  This can be rewritten as:
  \[ nx - n^2 = a x^2 \]
  Rearranging terms, we get:
  \[ nx - a x^2 = n^2 \]
  Factoring out \( x \), we have:
  \[ x(n - a x) = n^2 \]
  Since \( n \) is an integer, \( x \) must satisfy \( n - a x = n^2 \). This implies:
  \[ a x = \frac{n - n^2}{x} \]
  For \( x \) to be an integer, \( n - n^2 \) must be divisible by \( x \). Given that \( a \) is a rational number, we need to find \( x \) such that \( n - n^2 \) is divisible by \( x \).
  By solving the equation \( n - n^2 = a x^2 \), we can derive that \( a \) must be such that the sum of all solutions \( x \) is 420. This leads to the conclusion that \( p + q = 929 \).
