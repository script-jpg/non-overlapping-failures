  Given the number \( a = \frac{p}{q} \), where \( p \) and \( q \) are relatively prime positive integers, we need to show that the sum of all real numbers \( x \) satisfying the equation 
  \[ \lfloor x \rfloor \cdot \{x\} = a \cdot x^2 \]
  is 420. We are given that \( a = \frac{p}{q} \) and the sum of all \( x \) satisfying the equation is 420. We need to find \( p + q \).

  -- We need to show that the sum of all real numbers \( x \) satisfying the equation is 420.
  have : ∑ x : ℝ in S, x = 420 := h₁
  -- We need to show that \( a.den + a.num = 929 \).
  have : a.den + a.num = 929 := by
