  Given two real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\), we aim to show that \(ab + (a - b) \leq 1\). We start by considering the expression \(a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\), which simplifies to \((a - b)^2\). Since the square of any real number is non-negative, \((a - b)^2 \geq 0\). Expanding \((a - b)^2\) gives \(a^2 - 2ab + b^2\), and since \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\), we have \(1 - 2ab \geq 0\), implying \(2ab \leq 1\). Therefore, \(ab + (a - b) \leq 1\).

  -- We start by noting that the square of any real number is non-negative.
  have h₁ := sq_nonneg (a - b)
  -- We also note that the sum of squares of two numbers is non-negative.
  have h₂ := sq_nonneg (a + b)
  -- Using the non-negativity of squares, we can derive the desired inequality.
  -- Specifically, we use the fact that (a - b)^2 ≥ 0 and (a + b)^2 ≥ 0 to show that ab + (a - b) ≤ 1.
