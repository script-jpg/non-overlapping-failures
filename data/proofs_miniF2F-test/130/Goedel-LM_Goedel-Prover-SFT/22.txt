  Given two real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\), we need to show that \(ab + (a - b) \leq 1\). We start by noting that the square of any real number is non-negative. Using this property, we derive the inequality by considering the squares of various expressions involving \(a\) and \(b\). Specifically, we use the fact that the square of \(a + b\) is non-negative, the square of \(a - b\) is non-negative, and the square of \(a + b + 1\) is non-negative. By combining these inequalities, we can derive the desired result.

  -- Using the non-negativity of squares, we derive the inequality by considering the squares of various expressions involving `a` and `b`.
