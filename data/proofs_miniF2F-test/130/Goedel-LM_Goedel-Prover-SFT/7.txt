  Given two real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\), we need to show that \(ab + (a - b) \leq 1\).
  First, consider the expression \(a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\). Since \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\), we have:
  \[ 1 - 2ab \geq 0 \]
  This implies:
  \[ 2ab \leq 1 \]
  Next, consider the expression \(a - b\). We can use the fact that \((a - b)^2 \geq 0\) (since the square of any real number is non-negative). Expanding \((a - b)^2\) gives:
  \[ (a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2 \]
  Since \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\), we have:
  \[ 1 - 2ab \geq 0 \]
  This simplifies to:
  \[ 2ab \leq 1 \]
  Now, we need to show that \(ab + (a - b) \leq 1\). We can rewrite the expression as:
  \[ ab + (a - b) = a^2 + b^2 - ab \]
  Since \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\), we have:
  \[ 1 - ab \leq 1 \]
  Thus, we conclude:
  \[ ab + (a - b) \leq 1 \]

  have h₃ := sq_nonneg (a + b - 2 * a)
  have h₄ := sq_nonneg (a + b + 2 * a)
  -- Using the non-negativity of squares, we can derive the desired inequality.
