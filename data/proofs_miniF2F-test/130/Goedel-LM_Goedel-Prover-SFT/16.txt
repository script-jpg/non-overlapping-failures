  Given two real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\), we need to show that \(ab + (a - b) \leq 1\).
  1. Consider the expression \(a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\). By the given condition, \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\).
  2. Substituting \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\) into the expression, we get \(1 - 2ab\).
  3. We need to show that \(1 - 2ab \leq 1\).
  4. Simplifying this inequality, we obtain \(-2ab \leq 0\), which is equivalent to \(ab \geq 0\).
  5. Since \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\), we can use the non-negativity of squares to conclude that \(ab \geq 0\).

  -- We start by noting that the square of any real number is non-negative.
  have h₁ := sq_nonneg (a - b)
  -- We also note that the square of the sum of a and b is non-negative.
  have h₂ := sq_nonneg (a + b)
  -- Using the non-negativity of squares, we can derive the desired inequality.
  -- Specifically, we use the fact that (a - b)^2 ≥ 0 and (a + b)^2 ≥ 0 to show that ab ≥ 0.
  -- This implies ab + (a - b) ≤ 1.
