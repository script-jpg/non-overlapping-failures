  Given two real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\), we need to show that \(ab + (a - b) \leq 1\).
  1. Start by considering the expression \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\).
  2. Use the non-negativity of the square of any real number to establish several inequalities involving \(a\) and \(b\).
  3. Apply the non-negative property of squares to derive inequalities involving \(a + b\), \(a - b\), and \(a + b - 2a\).
  4. Combine these inequalities using non-linear arithmetic to conclude that \(ab + (a - b) \leq 1\).
