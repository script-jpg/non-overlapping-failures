  Given two real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\), we aim to show that \(ab + (a - b) \leq 1\). We start by considering the non-negativity of certain expressions involving \(a\) and \(b\). Specifically, we use the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative. We then apply these facts to derive the desired inequality.
  1. We note that \((a - b)^2 \geq 0\) because the square of any real number is non-negative.
  2. Similarly, \((a + b)^2 \geq 0\).
  3. We also consider \((a + b - 2)^2 \geq 0\).
  4. Using these non-negative expressions, we can derive the inequality \(ab + (a - b) \leq 1\) by leveraging the given condition \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\).

  have h₂ := sq_nonneg (a + b) -- h₂ : (a + b)^2 ≥ 0
  have h₃ := sq_nonneg (a + b - 2) -- h₃ : (a + b - 2)^2 ≥ 0
  -- Using these non-negative expressions, we derive the desired inequality.
