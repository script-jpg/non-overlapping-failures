  Given two real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\), we need to show that \(ab + (a - b) \leq 1\). We start by considering the expression \(a^2 - 2ab + b^2\) and use the given condition to derive a bound. Specifically, we can rewrite \(a^2 - 2ab + b^2\) as \((a - b)^2\). Since the square of any real number is non-negative, \((a - b)^2 \geq 0\). Using the given condition \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\), we can then apply algebraic manipulations and inequalities to show that \(ab + (a - b) \leq 1\).

  have h₁ : a ^ 2 - 2 * a * b + b ^ 2 ≥ 0 := by
    -- We recognize that a^2 - 2ab + b^2 is the square of (a - b), which is non-negative.
    have h₂ : (a - b) ^ 2 ≥ 0 := by
      -- The square of any real number is non-negative.
