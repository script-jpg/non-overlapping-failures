  Given two real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\), we need to show that \(ab + (a - b) \leq 1\).
  1. Consider the expression \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\).
  2. We aim to show that \(ab + (a - b) \leq 1\).
  3. Use the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative. Specifically, consider the squares of \(a + b\) and \(a - b\).
  4. Apply the non-negativity of squares to derive inequalities involving \(a\) and \(b\).
  5. Combine these inequalities to achieve the desired result.
