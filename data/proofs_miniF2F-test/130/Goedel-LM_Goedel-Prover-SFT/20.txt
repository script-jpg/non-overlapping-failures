  Given two real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\), we need to show that \(ab + (a - b) \leq 1\). We start by rewriting the expression \(ab + (a - b)\) as \(2ab + a - b\). Using the fact that \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\), we can apply algebraic inequalities to bound \(2ab + a - b\). Specifically, we use the non-negativity of squares to derive the desired inequality.

  -- Rewrite the expression ab + (a - b) as 2ab + a - b
  have h₁ : a * b + (a - b) = 2 * a * b + a - b := by ring
  rw [h₁]
  -- Use non-negative properties of squares and linear arithmetic to bound 2ab + a - b
  nlinarith [sq_nonneg (a + b), sq_nonneg (a - b), h₀, sq_nonneg (a + b - 1)]
