  Given two real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\), we need to show that \(ab + (a - b) \leq 1\).
  1. Start by rewriting the expression \(ab + (a - b)\) in a form that highlights the difference between the terms.
  2. Use the fact that \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\) and the non-negativity of squares to derive a bound for the expression.
  3. Specifically, consider the squares of the differences and sums of \(a\) and \(b\) to establish the inequality.
