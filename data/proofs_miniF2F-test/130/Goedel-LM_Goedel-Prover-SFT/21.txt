  Given two real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\), we aim to show that \(ab + (a - b) \leq 1\). We start by noting that the square of any real number is non-negative. Specifically, we use the non-negativity of \((a + b)^2\) and \((a - b)^2\). These inequalities, combined with the given condition \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\), allow us to derive the desired inequality through algebraic manipulation and linear arithmetic.

  -- We use the non-negativity of squares to derive inequalities.
  have h₁ := sq_nonneg (a + b) -- h₁: 0 ≤ (a + b)^2
  have h₂ := sq_nonneg (a - b) -- h₂: 0 ≤ (a - b)^2
  -- Using the non-negativity of squares and the given condition a^2 + b^2 = 1,
  -- we can derive the inequality ab + (a - b) ≤ 1 through linear arithmetic.
