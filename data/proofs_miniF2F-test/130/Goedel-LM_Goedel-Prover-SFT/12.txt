  Given two real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\), we need to show that \(ab + (a - b) \leq 1\).
  1. Start by rewriting the expression \(ab + (a - b)\) in a form that allows us to use the given condition \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\).
  2. Expand and simplify the expression to facilitate comparison with 1.
  3. Use the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative to derive inequalities that bound the expression.
  4. Combine these inequalities to show that \(ab + (a - b) \leq 1\).

  -- We start by noting that the square of any real number is non-negative.
  have h₁ : 0 ≤ (a - b) ^ 2 := sq_nonneg (a - b)
  -- We also note that the square of any real number is non-negative.
  have h₂ : 0 ≤ (a + b) ^ 2 := sq_nonneg (a + b)
  -- We use the non-negativity of squares to derive inequalities.
  have h₃ : a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 = 1 := h₀
  -- We expand and simplify the expression to facilitate comparison with 1.
  have h₄ : a * b + (a - b) ≤ 1 := by
    -- We use the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative to derive inequalities.
    nlinarith [sq_nonneg (a - b), sq_nonneg (a + b)]
  -- We conclude the proof by using the derived inequalities.
