  Given two real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\), we need to show that \(ab + (a - b) \leq 1\). We start by considering the square of the difference \(a - b\). Since \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\), we can use this to bound the expression \(ab + (a - b)\). Specifically, we use the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative, and apply this to the expression \(a - b\). By expanding and simplifying the inequality, we can derive the desired result.

  -- We start by noting that the square of any real number is non-negative.
  have h₁ := sq_nonneg (a - b)
  -- We also note that the square of the sum of a and b is non-negative.
  have h₂ := sq_nonneg (a + b)
  -- Using the non-negativity of squares, we can derive the desired inequality.
  -- Specifically, we use the fact that (a - b)^2 and (a + b)^2 are non-negative.
  nlinarith [sq_nonneg (a - b)]
