  Given two real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\), we need to show that \(ab + (a - b) \leq 1\).
  1. Start by rewriting the expression \(ab + (a - b)\) in a form that allows us to use the given condition \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\).
  2. Express \(ab + (a - b)\) as \(a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\).
  3. Substitute \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\) into the expression to get \(1 - 2ab\).
  4. Recognize that \(1 - 2ab\) is a quadratic expression in terms of \(ab\).
  5. Since \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\), we know that \(ab \leq \frac{1}{2}\) (because \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\) and the maximum value of \(ab\) occurs when \(a = b\) or \(a = -b\)).
  6. Therefore, \(1 - 2ab \leq 1 - 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 0\), which is always less than or equal to 1.
