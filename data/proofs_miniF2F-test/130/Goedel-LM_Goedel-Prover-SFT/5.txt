  Given two real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\), we need to show that \(ab + (a - b) \leq 1\).
  1. Start by rewriting the expression \(ab + (a - b)\) in a form that allows us to use the given condition \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\).
  2. Express \(ab + (a - b)\) as a sum of squares, specifically \((a + b)^2 - 2ab\).
  3. Substitute this expression into the inequality \(ab + (a - b) \leq 1\).
  4. Since \((a + b)^2 \geq 0\) for all real numbers \(a\) and \(b\), the inequality \((a + b)^2 - 2ab \leq 1\) follows directly from the given condition \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\).
