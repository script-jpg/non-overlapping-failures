  Given two real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\), we need to show that \(ab + (a - b) \leq 1\).
  1. Start by rewriting the expression \(ab + (a - b)\) as \(a(b + 1 - b)\).
  2. Use the fact that \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\) to bound the expression.
  3. Apply the non-negative property of squares to derive the desired inequality.
