-- The key identity to use is $(a-b)^2 \geq 0$
  have h₁ : (a - b) ^ 2 ≥ 0 := by
    exact sq_nonneg (a - b)

  -- We can rewrite this as $a^2-2ab+b^2 \geq 0$
  have h₂ : a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 - 2 * a * b ≥ 0 := by
    linarith

  -- Using the hypothesis $a^2+b^2=1$, we get $1-2ab \geq 0$
  have h₃ : 1 - 2 * a * b ≥ 0 := by
    linarith

  -- This simplifies to $2ab \leq 1$
  have h₄ : 2 * a * b ≤ 1 := by
    linarith

  -- The goal is equivalent to $2ab \leq 1$, so we are done
