-- We have $(a-b)^2\geq 0$.
  have : (a - b) ^ 2 ≥ 0 := by
    exact sq_nonneg (a - b)

  -- We have $(a+b)^2\geq 0$.
  have : (a + b) ^ 2 ≥ 0 := by
    exact sq_nonneg (a + b)

  -- We have $a^2+b^2=1$.
  have h₁ : a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 = 1 := h₀

  -- Rearrange the inequality we want to prove, then we have $(a-b)^2\geq 0$.
  suffices (a - b) ^ 2 ≥ 0 by
    linarith

  -- This is true because square of any real numbers is nonnegative.
