  To solve for \( a \) in the equation \(\dfrac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}} - a^{-1} = 1\), we start by simplifying the left-hand side. We know that \( 8 = 2^3 \) and \( 4 = 2^2 \). Using these identities, we can rewrite the equation in terms of powers of 2.
  First, we express \( 8^{-1} \) and \( 4^{-1} \) in terms of powers of 2:
  \[ 8^{-1} = (2^3)^{-1} = 2^{-3} \]
  \[ 4^{-1} = (2^2)^{-1} = 2^{-2} \]
  Next, we substitute these expressions back into the equation:
  \[ \dfrac{2^{-3}}{2^{-2}} - a^{-1} = 1 \]
  Simplify the fraction:
  \[ \dfrac{2^{-3}}{2^{-2}} = 2^{-3 - (-2)} = 2^{-1} = \dfrac{1}{2} \]
  Thus, the equation becomes:
  \[ \dfrac{1}{2} - a^{-1} = 1 \]
  To isolate \( a^{-1} \), we subtract \(\dfrac{1}{2}\) from both sides:
  \[ a^{-1} = \dfrac{1}{2} - 1 = -\dfrac{1}{2} \]
  Finally, taking the reciprocal of both sides, we find:
  \[ a = -2 \]
