  To solve for \( a \) in the equation \(\dfrac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}} - a^{-1} = 1\), we start by simplifying the left-hand side of the equation. First, we recognize that \( 8^{-1} \) and \( 4^{-1} \) can be rewritten in terms of powers of 2. We have:
  \[
  \dfrac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}} = \dfrac{1}{8} \cdot \dfrac{4}{1} = \dfrac{4}{8} = \dfrac{1}{2}
  \]
  Thus, the equation becomes:
  \[
  \dfrac{1}{2} - a^{-1} = 1
  \]
  Next, we isolate \( a^{-1} \) by subtracting \(\dfrac{1}{2}\) from both sides:
  \[
  a^{-1} = \dfrac{1}{2} - 1 = -\frac{1}{2}
  \]
  Finally, we take the reciprocal of both sides to solve for \( a \):
  \[
  a = -2
  \]
