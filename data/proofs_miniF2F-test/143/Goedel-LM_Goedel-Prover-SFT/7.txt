  To solve for \( a \) in the equation \(\dfrac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}} - a^{-1} = 1\), we proceed as follows:
  1. Simplify the left-hand side of the equation:
     \[
     \dfrac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}} = \dfrac{\dfrac{1}{8}}{\dfrac{1}{4}} = \dfrac{1}{8} \times \dfrac{4}{1} = \dfrac{4}{8} = \dfrac{1}{2}
     \]
  2. Substitute this back into the equation:
     \[
     \dfrac{1}{2} - a^{-1} = 1
     \]
  3. Solve for \( a^{-1} \):
     \[
     \dfrac{1}{2} - 1 = a^{-1} \implies -\frac{1}{2} = a^{-1} \implies a^{-1} = -\frac{1}{2}
     \]
  4. Taking the inverse of both sides, we find:
     \[
     a = -2
     \]
