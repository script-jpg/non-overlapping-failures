  To solve for \( a \) in the equation \(\dfrac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}} - a^{-1} = 1\), we start by simplifying the left-hand side. We know that \( 8 = 2^3 \) and \( 4 = 2^2 \). Thus, we can rewrite the equation as:
  \[
  \dfrac{\left(\frac{1}{2^3}\right)}{\left(\frac{1}{2^2}\right)} - \dfrac{1}{a} = 1
  \]
  Simplifying the fractions, we get:
  \[
  \dfrac{1}{2^3} \cdot \dfrac{2^2}{1} - \dfrac{1}{a} = 1
  \]
  This simplifies to:
  \[
  \dfrac{2^2}{2^3} - \dfrac{1}{a} = 1
  \]
  Further simplifying the fraction, we have:
  \[
  \dfrac{4}{8} - \dfrac{1}{a} = 1
  \]
  This simplifies to:
  \[
  \dfrac{1}{2} - \dfrac{1}{a} = 1
  \]
  To isolate \(\dfrac{1}{a}\), we subtract \(\dfrac{1}{2}\) from both sides:
  \[
  -\dfrac{1}{a} = 1 - \dfrac{1}{2}
  \]
  Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:
  \[
  -\dfrac{1}{a} = \dfrac{1}{2}
  \]
  Multiplying both sides by -2, we find:
  \[
  a = -2
  \]
