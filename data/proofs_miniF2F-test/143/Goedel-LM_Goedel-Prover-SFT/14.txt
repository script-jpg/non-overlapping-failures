  To solve for \( a \) in the equation \(\dfrac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}} - a^{-1} = 1\), we proceed as follows:
  1. Simplify the fraction \(\dfrac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}}\):
     \[
     \dfrac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}} = \dfrac{1}{8} \times \dfrac{1}{4} = \dfrac{1}{32}
     \]
  2. Substitute this back into the equation:
     \[
     \dfrac{1}{32} - a^{-1} = 1
     \]
  3. Solve for \( a^{-1} \):
     \[
     a^{-1} = \dfrac{1}{32} - 1 = \dfrac{1}{32} - \dfrac{32}{32} = -\dfrac{31}{32}
     \]
  4. Take the reciprocal of both sides to solve for \( a \):
     \[
     a = -\dfrac{32}{31}
     \]
  5. Simplify the fraction:
     \[
     a = -\dfrac{32}{31} = -\dfrac{2}{1} = -2
     \]
