  To solve for \( a \) in the equation \(\dfrac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}} - a^{-1} = 1\), we start by simplifying the left-hand side of the equation. First, we recognize that \( 8 = 2^3 \) and \( 4 = 2^2 \). Thus, the equation becomes:
  \[
  \dfrac{2^3^{-1}}{2^2^{-1}} - a^{-1} = 1
  \]
  Simplifying the exponents, we get:
  \[
  \dfrac{2^{-3}}{2^{-2}} - a^{-1} = 1
  \]
  This simplifies to:
  \[
  2^{-3 + 2} - a^{-1} = 1
  \]
  \[
  2^{-1} - a^{-1} = 1
  \]
  \[
  \frac{1}{2} - a^{-1} = 1
  \]
  Solving for \( a^{-1} \), we find:
  \[
  a^{-1} = \frac{1}{2} - 1
  \]
  \[
  a^{-1} = -\frac{1}{2}
  \]
  Taking the reciprocal of both sides, we obtain:
  \[
  a = -2
  \]
