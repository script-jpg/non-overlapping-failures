  To solve for \( a \) in the equation \(\dfrac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}} - a^{-1} = 1\), we start by simplifying the left-hand side. We know that \( 8^{-1} = \frac{1}{8} \) and \( 4^{-1} = \frac{1}{4} \). Substituting these into the equation, we get:
  \[
  \frac{1}{8} / \frac{1}{4} - a^{-1} = 1
  \]
  Simplifying the division:
  \[
  \frac{1}{8} \times \frac{4}{1} - a^{-1} = 1
  \]
  This simplifies to:
  \[
  \frac{4}{8} - a^{-1} = 1
  \]
  Further simplifying:
  \[
  \frac{1}{2} - a^{-1} = 1
  \]
  Solving for \( a^{-1} \):
  \[
  a^{-1} = \frac{1}{2} - 1 = -\frac{1}{2}
  \]
  Thus, \( a = -2 \).
