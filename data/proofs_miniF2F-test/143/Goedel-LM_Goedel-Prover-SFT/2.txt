  To solve for \( a \) in the equation \(\dfrac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}} - a^{-1} = 1\), we start by simplifying the left-hand side of the equation. First, we rewrite the fractions using the properties of exponents:
  \[
  \dfrac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}} = \dfrac{\frac{1}{8}}{\frac{1}{4}} = \frac{1}{8} \times \frac{4}{1} = \frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2}
  \]
  Thus, the equation becomes:
  \[
  \frac{1}{2} - a^{-1} = 1
  \]
  Next, we isolate \( a^{-1} \) by subtracting 1 from both sides:
  \[
  \frac{1}{2} - 1 = a^{-1}
  \]
  Simplifying the left-hand side:
  \[
  \frac{1}{2} - 1 = -\frac{1}{2}
  \]
  Therefore, we have:
  \[
  a^{-1} = -\frac{1}{2}
  \]
  To find \( a \), we take the reciprocal of both sides:
  \[
  a = -\frac{1}{2}
  \]
  Thus, the value of \( a \) is \( -2 \).
