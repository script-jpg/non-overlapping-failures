  To solve for \( a \) in the equation \(\dfrac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}} - a^{-1} = 1\), we start by simplifying the left-hand side of the equation. We know that \( 8^{-1} = \frac{1}{8} \) and \( 4^{-1} = \frac{1}{4} \). Substituting these into the equation, we get:
  \[
  \frac{\frac{1}{8}}{\frac{1}{4}} - a^{-1} = 1
  \]
  Simplifying the fraction \(\frac{\frac{1}{8}}{\frac{1}{4}}\):
  \[
  \frac{\frac{1}{8}}{\frac{1}{4}} = \frac{1}{8} \times \frac{4}{1} = \frac{1}{2}
  \]
  Thus, the equation becomes:
  \[
  \frac{1}{2} - a^{-1} = 1
  \]
  Subtracting \(\frac{1}{2}\) from both sides:
  \[
  -\frac{1}{2} = a^{-1}
  \]
  Taking the reciprocal of both sides, we find:
  \[
  a = -2
  \]
