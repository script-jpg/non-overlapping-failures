We're given the equation $\frac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}} - a^{-1} = 1$ and need to solve for $a$.

First, let's simplify $\frac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}}$. We have:
- $8^{-1} = \frac{1}{8}$
- $4^{-1} = \frac{1}{4}$

So $\frac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}} = \frac{\frac{1}{8}}{\frac{1}{4}} = \frac{1}{8} \cdot \frac{4}{1} = \frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2}$.

Now our equation becomes:
$\frac{1}{2} - a^{-1} = 1$

Rearranging gives:
$a^{-1} = \frac{1}{2} - 1 = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{2}{2} = -\frac{1}{2}$

Since $a^{-1} = \frac{1}{a}$, we have $\frac{1}{a} = -\frac{1}{2}$, which means $a = -2$.

Let's translate this to Lean 4:

```tactics
import Mathlib
import Aesop

set_option maxHeartbeats 0

open BigOperators Real Nat Topology Rat
```

We've imported the necessary libraries and opened namespaces for working with real numbers and arithmetic operations.

Now, let's define the theorem statement:

```tactics
theorem mathd_algebra_129 (a : ℝ) (h₀ : a ≠ 0) (h₁ : 8⁻¹ / 4⁻¹ - a⁻¹ = 1) : a = -2 := by
```

We have:
- $a$ is a real number
- $a \neq 0$ (so $a^{-1}$ is well-defined)
- $\frac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}} - a^{-1} = 1$
- We need to prove $a = -2$

Let's compute $\frac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}}$:
- $8^{-1} = \frac{1}{8}$
- $4^{-1} = \frac{1}{4}$
- $\frac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}} = \frac{\frac{1}{8}}{\frac{1}{4}} = \frac{1}{8} \cdot \frac{4}{1} = \frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2}$

So our equation becomes $\frac{1}{2} - a^{-1} = 1$, which simplifies to $a^{-1} = -\frac{1}{2}$.

Since $a^{-1} = \frac{1}{a}$, we have $\frac{1}{a} = -\frac{1}{2}$, which means $a = -2$.

In Lean, we'll use `field_simp` to handle the rational expressions involving $a^{-1}$:

```tactics
field_simp at h₁ ⊢
```

After applying `field_simp`, Lean will rewrite the equation to eliminate the fractions. The expression $a^{-1}$ becomes $\frac{1}{a}$, and the equation becomes $\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{a} = 1$.

The `at h₁ ⊢` syntax means we're applying `field_simp` both to the hypothesis `h₁` and to the goal (indicated by the turnstile symbol `⊢`).

Now we need to solve the resulting equation. From $\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{a} = 1$, we get $\frac{1}{a} = -\frac{1}{2}$, which implies $a = -2$.

We can use `linarith` to solve this linear arithmetic problem:

```tactics
linarith
```

The `linarith` tactic is powerful enough to solve linear goals involving real numbers. After `field_simp` has rewritten the equation to $\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{a} = 1$, it becomes a simple linear equation in $\frac{1}{a}$, which `linarith` can solve to get $\frac{1}{a} = -\frac{1}{2}$, and therefore $a = -2$.

In conclusion, we've shown that the unique solution to the equation $\frac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}} - a^{-1} = 1$ is $a = -2$.
