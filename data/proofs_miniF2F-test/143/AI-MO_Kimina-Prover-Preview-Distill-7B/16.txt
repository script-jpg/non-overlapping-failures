-- Solve for $a$: $\dfrac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}}-a^{-1}=1$. Show that it is -2.-/
  -- Calculate $8^{-1}$ and $4^{-1}$. well, actually, calculation is not necessary.
  have h : 8⁻¹ / 4⁻¹ = 1 / 2 := by norm_num
  -- Substitute $8^{-1}/4^{-1}$ by $1/2$ in the equation. well, calculation is not necessary.

  -- We get $a = -2$ from the equation.
