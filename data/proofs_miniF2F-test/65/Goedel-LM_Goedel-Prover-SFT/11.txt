  To solve the expression \(\frac{\log_2 80}{\log_{40} 2} - \frac{\log_2 160}{\log_{20} 2}\), we start by expressing the logarithms in terms of the natural logarithm. We then simplify the expression by clearing denominators and simplifying the resulting expression. Finally, we verify that the simplified expression equals 2.
