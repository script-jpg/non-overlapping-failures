To prove that \(3 \star 11 = \frac{1}{33}\) using the given operation \(a \star b = \frac{\left(\dfrac{1}{b} - \dfrac{1}{a}\right)}{(a - b)}\), we start by substituting \(a = 3\) and \(b = 11\) into the operation. This gives us:
\[
3 \star 11 = \frac{\left(\dfrac{1}{11} - \dfrac{1}{3}\right)}{(3 - 11)}
\]
Next, we simplify the numerator and the denominator separately. The numerator becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{11} - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{3 - 11}{33} = \frac{-8}{33}
\]
The denominator is:
\[
3 - 11 = -8
\]
Thus, the operation simplifies to:
\[
3 \star 11 = \frac{\frac{-8}{33}}{-8} = \frac{-8}{33} \cdot \frac{1}{-8} = \frac{1}{33}
\]
