To prove that \( s(3, 11) = \frac{1}{33} \) given the function \( s(a, b) = \frac{\left(\frac{1}{b} - \frac{1}{a}\right)}{(a - b)} \), we substitute \( a = 3 \) and \( b = 11 \) into the function and simplify step by step.
1. Substitute \( a = 3 \) and \( b = 11 \) into \( s(a, b) \):
   \[
   s(3, 11) = \frac{\left(\frac{1}{11} - \frac{1}{3}\right)}{(3 - 11)}
   \]
2. Simplify the numerator:
   \[
   \frac{1}{11} - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{3 - 11}{33} = \frac{-8}{33}
   \]
3. Simplify the denominator:
   \[
   3 - 11 = -8
   \]
4. Combine the simplified numerator and denominator:
   \[
   s(3, 11) = \frac{\frac{-8}{33}}{-8} = \frac{1}{33}
   \]
Thus, we have shown that \( s(3, 11) = \frac{1}{33} \).
