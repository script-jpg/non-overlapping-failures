To prove that \( s(3, 11) = \frac{1}{33} \) given the function \( s(a, b) = \frac{\left(\frac{1}{b} - \frac{1}{a}\right)}{(a - b)} \), we proceed as follows:
1. Substitute \( a = 3 \) and \( b = 11 \) into the function definition.
2. Simplify the expression step by step.
3. Verify that the simplified result matches \( \frac{1}{33} \).
