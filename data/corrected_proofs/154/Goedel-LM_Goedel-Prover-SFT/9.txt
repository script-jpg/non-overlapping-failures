To show that the value \( x = 7 \) gives the minimum value for the quadratic expression \( x^2 - 14x + 3 \), we start by rewriting the inequality \( x^2 - 14x + 3 \geq 7^2 - 14 \cdot 7 + 3 \). We then use the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative to establish the inequality. Specifically, we consider the expression \( (x - 7)^2 \), which is non-negative for all \( x \). By expanding and simplifying \( (x - 7)^2 \), we can derive the desired inequality.
