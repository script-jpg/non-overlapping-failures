-- the proof is to show that the quadratic function is a parabola opening upwards, and thus its minimum value occur at the vertex. And the x-coordinate of the vertex is 7.
have h : x ^ 2 - 14 * x + 3 = (x - 7) ^ 2 + (7 ^ 2 - 14 * 7 + 3) := by ring
rw [h]
have h1 : (x - 7) ^ 2 ≥ 0 := by exact sq_nonneg (x - 7)
