-- the sum of square is always nonnegative
have h : (x - 7) ^ 2 ≥ 0 := by exact sq_nonneg (x - 7)
-- write down the equation
have h1 : x ^ 2 - 14 * x + 3 = (x - 7) ^ 2 - 46 := by ring
-- use the equation to rewrite, and we need the property that the square is nonnegative
rw [h1]
-- use the property that the square is nonnegative to prove the goal
