-- We are given an expression and need to show it equals 1.

-- Let's start by simplifying the expression algebraically.
-- The expression is: (100^2 - 7^2)/(70^2 - 11^2) * ((70-11)(70+11)/((100-7)(100+7)))

-- First, notice that we have differences of squares in both the numerators and denominators.
-- Recall the difference of squares formula: a^2 - b^2 = (a-b)(a+b)

-- Applying this to the first fraction:
-- (100^2 - 7^2) = (100 - 7)(100 + 7)
-- (70^2 - 11^2) = (70 - 11)(70 + 11)

-- So our expression becomes:
-- ((100 - 7)(100 + 7))/((70 - 11)(70 + 11)) * ((70 - 11)(70 + 11)/((100 - 7)(100 + 7)))

-- Now we can see that all terms cancel out:
-- (100 - 7) in the numerator and denominator
-- (100 + 7) in the numerator and denominator
-- (70 - 11) in the numerator and denominator
-- (70 + 11) in the numerator and denominator

-- After cancellation, we are left with 1/1 * 1/1 = 1
