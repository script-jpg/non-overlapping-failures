To prove that the value of the given expression is 1, we start by simplifying the expression using the difference of squares formula. The expression involves fractions and can be manipulated by canceling common terms. Specifically, we can factor the numerators and denominators using the difference of squares, which states that \(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\). After factoring, we can cancel out common terms in the numerator and the denominator. Finally, we verify that the simplified expression equals 1.
