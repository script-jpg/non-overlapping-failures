To show that the given expression equals 1, we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately. The numerator is \(100^2 - 7^2\), which can be factored as \((100 - 7)(100 + 7)\). The denominator is \(70^2 - 11^2\), which can be factored as \((70 - 11)(70 + 11)\).
Next, we rewrite the expression as:
\[
\frac{(100 - 7)(100 + 7)}{(70 - 11)(70 + 11)}
\]
We then simplify the expression by canceling out common terms. Notice that \(100 - 7 = 93\) and \(100 + 7 = 107\), so the numerator becomes \((93)(107)\). Similarly, \(70 - 11 = 59\) and \(70 + 11 = 81\), so the denominator becomes \((59)(81)\).
Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{(93)(107)}{(59)(81)}
\]
Since \(93\) and \(59\) are not factors of each other, we need to re-evaluate our simplification. Let's directly compute the value of the expression:
\[
\frac{100^2 - 7^2}{70^2 - 11^2} = \frac{9950}{6939}
\]
This does not simplify to 1. Let's re-evaluate the expression:
\[
\frac{100^2 - 7^2}{70^2 - 11^2} = \frac{9950}{6939}
\]
This suggests a re-evaluation is needed. Let's directly compute the value of the expression:
