To determine the remainder of 54 when divided by 6, we can use the properties of modular arithmetic. Specifically, we can break down 54 into a sum of multiples of 6 and then apply the modulo operation. We start by expressing 54 as a sum of multiples of 6 plus a remainder. The sum of multiples of 6 is 54, and the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is 0. This can be verified by checking that 54 is exactly divisible by 6.
