To determine the remainder of 54 when divided by 6, we can use the properties of modular arithmetic. Specifically, we can break down the number 54 into a sum of multiples of 6 and a remainder. We know that:
\[ 54 = 6 \times 9 + 0 \]
This shows that 54 is exactly divisible by 6, with no remainder. Therefore, the remainder of 54 when divided by 6 is 0.
