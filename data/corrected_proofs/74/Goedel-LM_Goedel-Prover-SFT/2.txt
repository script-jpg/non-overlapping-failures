To determine the remainder of 54 when divided by 6, we can use the modulo operation. The modulo operation calculates the remainder of the division of one number by another. In this case, we need to find \( 54 \mod 6 \).
First, we perform the division of 54 by 6:
\[ 54 \div 6 = 9 \]
This division tells us that:
\[ 54 = 6 \times 9 + 0 \]
Thus, the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is 0. Therefore, we have:
\[ 54 \mod 6 = 0 \]
