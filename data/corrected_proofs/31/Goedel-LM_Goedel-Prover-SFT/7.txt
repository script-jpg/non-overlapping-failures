Given that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of positive integers \( m \) and \( n \) is 6, and the least common multiple (lcm) of \( m \) and \( n \) is 126, we need to determine the least possible value of \( m + n \).
First, we use the property that the product of the gcd and lcm of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. Therefore, we have:
\[ m \times n = \text{gcd}(m, n) \times \text{lcm}(m, n) \]
Substituting the given values:
\[ m \times n = 6 \times 126 \]
Next, we simplify the right-hand side:
\[ 6 \times 126 = 756 \]
Thus, we have:
\[ m \times n = 756 \]
To find the least possible value of \( m + n \), we use the fact that the gcd of \( m \) and \( n \) is 6. This implies that both \( m \) and \( n \) must be multiples of 6. Let \( m = 6k \) and \( n = 6l \) for some integers \( k \) and \( l \).
Substituting these into the product equation:
\[ 6k \times 6l = 756 \]
\[ 36kl = 756 \]
Solving for \( kl \):
\[ kl = \frac{756}{36} = 21 \]
Since \( k \) and \( l \) are integers, the smallest possible values for \( k \) and \( l \) that multiply to 21 are \( k = 3 \) and \( l = 7 \) (or vice versa). Therefore, the least possible values for \( m \) and \( n \) are:
\[ m = 6 \times 3 = 18 \]
\[ n = 6 \times 7 = 42 \]
Thus, the least possible value of \( m + n \) is:
\[ 18 + 42 = 60 \]
