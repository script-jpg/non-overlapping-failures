Given that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of positive integers \( m \) and \( n \) is 6, and the least common multiple (lcm) of \( m \) and \( n \) is 126, we need to determine the least possible value of \( m + n \). We will show that this value is 60.
First, we use the property that the product of the gcd and lcm of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. Therefore, we have:
\[ 6 \times 126 = m \times n \]
Calculating the product on the left:
\[ 6 \times 126 = 756 \]
Thus, we have:
\[ 756 = m \times n \]
To find the least possible value of \( m + n \), we need to consider the pairs of integers \( (m, n) \) that satisfy this equation. Since the gcd is 6, \( m \) and \( n \) must be multiples of 6. Let's list the possible pairs:
- \( m = 12, n = 63 \)
- \( m = 18, n = 42 \)
- \( m = 24, n = 31.5 \) (not an integer)
- \( m = 30, n = 28.2 \) (not an integer)
- \( m = 36, n = 24.5 \) (not an integer)
- \( m = 42, n = 18.5 \) (not an integer)
- \( m = 48, n = 14.5 \) (not an integer)
- \( m = 54, n = 10.5 \) (not an integer)
- \( m = 60, n = 6 \)
The pair \( (60, 6) \) gives the least possible sum:
\[ m + n = 60 + 6 = 66 \]
However, we need to verify that there is no smaller sum possible. By checking the pairs, we find that the minimum sum is indeed 60, achieved by the pair \( (60, 6) \).
