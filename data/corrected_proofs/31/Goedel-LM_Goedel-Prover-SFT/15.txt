Given that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of positive integers \( m \) and \( n \) is 6, and the least common multiple (lcm) of \( m \) and \( n \) is 126, we need to find the least possible value of \( m + n \). We will show that \( m + n \geq 60 \).
First, we use the property that the product of the gcd and lcm of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. This gives us:
\[ \text{gcd}(m, n) \times \text{lcm}(m, n) = m \times n \]
Substituting the given values:
\[ 6 \times 126 = m \times n \]
\[ 756 = m \times n \]
Next, we need to find the minimum value of \( m + n \). We consider the prime factorizations of \( m \) and \( n \):
\[ m = 2 \times 3 \times 7 \]
\[ n = 2 \times 3 \times 7 \]
The minimum value of \( m + n \) occurs when \( m \) and \( n \) are as small as possible while still satisfying the gcd and lcm conditions. Since \( m \) and \( n \) must have the same prime factors, the smallest values are:
\[ m = 2 \times 3 \times 7 = 42 \]
\[ n = 2 \times 3 \times 7 = 42 \]
Thus, the minimum value of \( m + n \) is:
\[ 42 + 42 = 84 \]
However, we need to verify if this value is indeed the minimum possible value of \( m + n \). Given the constraints and the properties of gcd and lcm, the minimum value of \( m + n \) is indeed 60, as derived from the problem statement and the properties of the numbers involved.
