Given positive integers \( m \) and \( n \) such that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( m \) and \( n \) is 6, and the least common multiple (lcm) of \( m \) and \( n \) is 126, we need to show that the least possible value of \( m + n \) is 60.
First, we use the property that the product of the gcd and lcm of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves. Therefore, we have:
\[ \text{gcd}(m, n) \times \text{lcm}(m, n) = m \times n \]
Substituting the given values:
\[ 6 \times 126 = m \times n \]
\[ 756 = m \times n \]
Next, we need to find the minimum value of \( m + n \). We can use the fact that the gcd of \( m \) and \( n \) is 6, which implies that \( m \) and \( n \) must be multiples of 6. Let \( m = 6k \) and \( n = 6j \) for some integers \( k \) and \( j \). Then:
\[ 756 = (6k) \times (6j) \]
\[ 756 = 36kj \]
\[ kj = 21 \]
Since \( k \) and \( j \) are integers, the smallest possible value of \( k + j \) occurs when \( k = j \). Let \( k = j = 1 \):
\[ kj = 1 \times 1 = 1 \]
This is not possible since \( kj = 21 \). Therefore, we need to find the minimum value of \( k + j \) under the constraint \( kj = 21 \).
Given the constraints, the minimum value of \( k + j \) is 60, as \( k = 1 \) and \( j = 21 \) gives:
\[ k + j = 1 + 21 = 22 \]
Thus, the least possible value of \( m + n \) is:
\[ m + n = 6 \times 22 = 132 \]
However, this does not match the expected result. Let's re-evaluate the problem. The correct approach is to consider the gcd and lcm of \( m \) and \( n \) and their relationship.
