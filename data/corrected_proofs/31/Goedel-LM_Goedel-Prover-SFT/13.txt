iven that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of positive integers \( m \) and \( n \) is 6, and the least common multiple (lcm) of \( m \) and \( n \) is 126, we need to determine the least possible value of \( m + n \). We will show that this value is 60.
1. We start by using the property that the product of the gcd and lcm of two numbers is equal to the product of the numbers themselves.
2. Using this property, we can derive the product of \( m \) and \( n \).
3. We then use the fact that the gcd of \( m \) and \( n \) is 6 and the lcm is 126 to find the sum \( m + n \).
4. By simplifying the derived equations and using basic arithmetic, we find that the sum \( m + n \) is at least 60.
