-- Because $2$ and $47$ are coprime, this congruence has a unique solution. As an application of the Bezout identity, we can prove that $n \equiv 31 \pmod{47}$ is the unique solution.

have h₁ : n % 47 = 31 := by

  -- Check that 2 * 31 % 47 = 62 % 47 = 15.
  try omega

-- The uniqueness of the solution follows from the fact that if $2n \equiv 2m \pmod{47}$, then $n \equiv m \pmod{47}$ since 2 and 47 are coprime.
