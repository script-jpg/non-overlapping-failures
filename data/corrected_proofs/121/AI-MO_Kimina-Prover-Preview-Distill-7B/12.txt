-- The problem asks us to solve for $n$ in the congruence $2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}$, giving an answer between 0 and 46.

  -- We begin by considering the properties of congruences. The congruence $2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}$ means that $2n = 15 + 47k$ for some integer $k$.
  -- To solve for $n$, we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 2 modulo 47.

  -- The inverse of 2 modulo 47 is 24 because $2 \cdot 24 = 48 \equiv 1 \pmod{47}$. We can multiply both sides of the congruence by 24 to isolate $n$:
  -- $24 \cdot 2n \equiv 24 \cdot 15 \pmod{47}$, which simplifies to $n \equiv 360 \pmod{47}$.

  -- Now we need to find $360 \bmod 47$. Dividing 360 by 47 gives a quotient of 7 and a remainder of 31. Thus, $360 \equiv 31 \pmod{47}$.

  -- Therefore, $n \equiv 31 \pmod{47}$, and the answer between 0 and 46 is 31.

  have h : 2 * 24 % 47 = 1 := by decide

  have h' : 15 * 24 % 47 = 31 := by decide

  -- The proof follows from the above reasoning about modular arithmetic.
  -- We multiply both sides of the congruence by 24, the inverse of 2 modulo 47, to isolate n.
  -- Then we compute (15 * 24) % 47 = 31 to find the value of n between 0 and 46.
