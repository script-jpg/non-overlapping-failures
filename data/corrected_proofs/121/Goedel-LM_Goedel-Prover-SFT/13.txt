To solve the congruence \(2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}\), we need to find an integer \(n\) such that \(2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}\). We can use the properties of modular arithmetic to find the solution.
1. Start with the given congruence \(2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}\).
2. We need to find \(n\) such that \(2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}\).
3. By the properties of modular arithmetic, we can solve for \(n\) by finding the multiplicative inverse of 2 modulo 47. The inverse of 2 modulo 47 is 23 because \(2 \times 23 \equiv 1 \pmod{47}\).
4. Multiply both sides of the congruence \(2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}\) by 23:
   \[
   23 \times (2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47})
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   n \equiv 15 \times 23 \pmod{47}
   \]
5. Calculate \(15 \times 23\):
   \[
   15 \times 23 = 345
   \]
6. Reduce 345 modulo 47:
   \[
   345 \div 47 = 7 \text{ remainder } 31 \implies 345 \equiv 31 \pmod{47}
   \]
7. Therefore, \(n \equiv 31 \pmod{47}\).
