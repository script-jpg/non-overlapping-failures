To solve the congruence \(2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}\), we need to find an integer \(n\) such that \(2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}\). We can rewrite this congruence as \(2n = 47k + 15\) for some integer \(k\). We need to find \(n\) such that \(2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}\).
First, we isolate \(n\) by dividing both sides by 2:
\[ n = \frac{47k + 15}{2} \]
To ensure \(n\) is an integer, \(47k + 15\) must be even. Since 47 is odd, \(47k\) is also odd, and adding 15 (which is even) to an odd number results in an odd number. Therefore, \(n\) must be an integer.
Next, we need to find \(n\) such that \(2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}\). We can test values of \(n\) modulo 47 to find a solution. By testing \(n = 31\):
\[ 2 \times 31 = 62 \]
\[ 62 \mod 47 = 15 \]
Thus, \(n \equiv 31 \pmod{47}\).
