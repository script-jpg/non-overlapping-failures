To solve the congruence \(2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}\), we need to find an integer \(n\) such that \(2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}\). We can test values of \(n\) modulo 47 to find a solution. Given the congruence, we can test \(n \equiv 31 \pmod{47}\) and verify that it satisfies the congruence.

-- We start by noting the given congruence condition.
have h₁ := h₀
-- We use the `omega` tactic to solve the congruence by testing possible values of `n` modulo 47.
have h₂ : n % 47 = 31 := by
  omega
-- We conclude that `n % 47` must be 31 based on the congruence.
