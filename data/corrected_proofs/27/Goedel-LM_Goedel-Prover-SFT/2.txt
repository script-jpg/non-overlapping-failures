To show that for any natural number \( n \), 12 divides \( 4^{n+1} + 20 \), we can use modular arithmetic to simplify the expression modulo 12. We start by expressing \( 4^{n+1} \) in terms of its modulo 12 value and then show that the resulting expression is congruent to 0 modulo 12.

  -- Simplify the expression modulo 12 using properties of modular arithmetic.
  -- Specifically, we use the fact that 4 ≡ 4 (mod 12), 4^2 ≡ 16 ≡ 4 (mod 12), and 4^3 ≡ 64 ≡ 4 (mod 12).
