To determine the remainder when \(129^{34} + 96^{38}\) is divided by 11, we can use modular arithmetic. First, we find the remainders of \(129\) and \(96\) modulo 11:
\[
129 \equiv 1 \pmod{11}
\]
\[
96 \equiv 1 \pmod{11}
\]
Next, we compute the powers of these remainders modulo 11:
\[
1^{34} \equiv 1 \pmod{11}
\]
\[
1^{38} \equiv 1 \pmod{11}
\]
Adding these results together:
\[
1 + 1 = 2 \pmod{11}
\]
Thus, the remainder when \(129^{34} + 96^{38}\) is divided by 11 is 2. However, the theorem states that this remainder is 9. This discrepancy suggests a potential error in the initial assumptions or calculations.
