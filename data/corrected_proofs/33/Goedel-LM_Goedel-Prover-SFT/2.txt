Given that Mr. Wrench charges \( N \) dollars for coming out to the house and \( x \) dollars per hour for each plumbing repair job, we know that for a one-hour repair job, the total charge is \( 97 \) dollars, and for a five-hour repair job, the total charge is \( 265 \) dollars. We need to determine the charge for a two-hour repair job, which we show to be \( 139 \) dollars.
First, we express the total charges for the one-hour and five-hour repair jobs in terms of \( N \) and \( x \):
\[ N + x = 97 \]
\[ N + 5x = 265 \]
To find \( x \), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (N + 5x) - (N + x) = 265 - 97 \]
\[ 4x = 168 \]
\[ x = 42 \]
Next, we substitute \( x = 42 \) back into the first equation to find \( N \):
\[ N + 42 = 97 \]
\[ N = 55 \]
Now, we calculate the total charge for a two-hour repair job:
\[ N + 2x = 55 + 2 \cdot 42 = 55 + 84 = 139 \]
Thus, the charge for a two-hour repair job is \( 139 \) dollars.
