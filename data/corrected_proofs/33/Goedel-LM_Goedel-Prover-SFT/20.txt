Given the charges for two plumbing repair jobs, we need to determine the charge for a two-hour repair job. We know:
- For the first repair job, the total charge is $97, which includes the charge \( n \) for the house plus \( x \) dollars per hour worked.
- For the second repair job, the total charge is $265, which includes the charge \( n \) for the house plus \( 5x \) dollars per hour worked.
We need to find the charge for a two-hour repair job, which is given by \( n + 2x \).
First, we solve for \( n \) and \( x \) using the given equations:
1. \( n + x = 97 \)
2. \( n + 5x = 265 \)
Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:
\[ (n + 5x) - (n + x) = 265 - 97 \]
\[ 4x = 168 \]
\[ x = 42 \]
Substituting \( x = 42 \) back into the first equation:
\[ n + 42 = 97 \]
\[ n = 55 \]
Now, we calculate the charge for a two-hour repair job:
\[ n + 2x = 55 + 2 \cdot 42 = 55 + 84 = 139 \]
Thus, the charge for a two-hour repair job is $139.

-- We start with the given equations for the charges.
have h₂ : n + x = 97 := h₀
have h₃ : n + 5 * x = 265 := h₁
-- Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate n and solve for x.
have h₄ : (n + 5 * x) - (n + x) = 265 - 97 := by linarith
have h₅ : 4 * x = 168 := by linarith
-- Solve for x.
have h₆ : x = 42 := by linarith
-- Substitute x back into the first equation to solve for n.
have h₇ : n + 42 = 97 := by linarith
have h₈ : n = 55 := by linarith
-- Calculate the charge for a two-hour repair job.
have h₉ : n + 2 * x = 55 + 2 * 42 := by linarith
have h₁₀ : n + 2 * x = 139 := by linarith
-- The final result.
