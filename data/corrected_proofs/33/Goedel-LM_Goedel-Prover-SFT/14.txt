Given the charges for plumbing repair jobs:
- For a one-hour repair job, Mr. Wrench charges \( N \) dollars for coming out to the house plus \( x \) dollars per hour that he works at the house.
- For a five-hour repair job, Mr. Wrench charges \( N + 5x \) dollars.
- For a two-hour repair job, Mr. Wrench charges \( N + 2x \) dollars.
We are provided with the equations:
1. \( N + x = 97 \)
2. \( N + 5x = 265 \)
To find the charge for a two-hour repair job, we need to solve for \( N \) and \( x \) using the given equations and then substitute these values into the expression for a two-hour repair job.
First, we subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( N \):
\[ (N + 5x) - (N + x) = 265 - 97 \]
\[ 4x = 168 \]
\[ x = 42 \]
Next, substitute \( x = 42 \) back into the first equation to solve for \( N \):
\[ N + 42 = 97 \]
\[ N = 97 - 42 \]
\[ N = 55 \]
Finally, substitute \( N = 55 \) and \( x = 42 \) into the expression for a two-hour repair job:
\[ N + 2x = 55 + 2 \times 42 \]
\[ N + 2x = 55 + 84 \]
\[ N + 2x = 139 \]
Thus, the charge for a two-hour repair job is \( \boxed{139} \).

have h₂ : 4 * x = 168 := by linarith [h₁, h₀]
-- Solve for x.
have h₃ : x = 42 := by linarith [h₂]
-- Substitute x = 42 back into the first equation to solve for N.
have h₄ : n = 55 := by linarith [h₀, h₃]
-- Substitute N = 55 and x = 42 into the expression for a two-hour repair job.
have h₅ : n + 2 * x = 139 := by linarith [h₃, h₄]
-- The final result matches the required charge for a two-hour repair job.
