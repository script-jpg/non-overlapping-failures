Given the charges for plumbing repair jobs, we need to determine the charge for a two-hour repair job. We know:
- For a one-hour repair job, the total charge is $97.
- For a five-hour repair job, the total charge is $265.
We need to find the total charge for a two-hour repair job, which is $139.
From the given equations:
1. \( n + x = 97 \)
2. \( n + 5x = 265 \)
We can solve for \( n \) and \( x \) using these equations. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:
\[ (n + 5x) - (n + x) = 265 - 97 \]
\[ 4x = 168 \]
\[ x = 42 \]
Substituting \( x = 42 \) back into the first equation:
\[ n + 42 = 97 \]
\[ n = 55 \]
Now, we need to verify the charge for a two-hour repair job:
\[ n + 2x = 55 + 2 \times 42 = 55 + 84 = 139 \]
Thus, the charge for a two-hour repair job is indeed $139.
