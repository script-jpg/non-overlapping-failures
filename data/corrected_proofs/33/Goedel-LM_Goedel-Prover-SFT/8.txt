Given the charges for two plumbing repair jobs:
- For a one-hour repair job, Mr. Wrench charges \( N \) dollars for the visit and \( x \) dollars per hour for work.
- For a five-hour repair job, Mr. Wrench charges \( N \) dollars for the visit and \( 5x \) dollars for the work.
We are provided with the following equations:
1. \( N + x = 97 \)
2. \( N + 5x = 265 \)
To find the charge for a two-hour repair job, we need to solve for \( N \) and \( x \). We can use the given equations to derive the values of \( N \) and \( x \).
First, subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( N \):
\[ (N + 5x) - (N + x) = 265 - 97 \]
\[ 4x = 168 \]
\[ x = 42 \]
Next, substitute \( x = 42 \) back into the first equation to find \( N \):
\[ N + 42 = 97 \]
\[ N = 55 \]
Now, calculate the charge for a two-hour repair job:
\[ N + 2x = 55 + 2 \times 42 \]
\[ N + 2x = 55 + 84 \]
\[ N + 2x = 139 \]
Thus, the charge for a two-hour repair job is \( 139 \).
