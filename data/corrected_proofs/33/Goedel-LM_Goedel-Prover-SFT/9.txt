Given the charges for plumbing repair jobs:
- For a one-hour repair job, Mr. Wrench charges \( N \) dollars for coming out to the house plus \( x \) dollars per hour that he works at the house. The total charge is \( 97 \) dollars.
- For a five-hour repair job, the total charge is \( 265 \) dollars.
We need to determine the charge for a two-hour repair job.
From the given equations:
1. \( N + x = 97 \)
2. \( N + 5x = 265 \)
We can solve for \( N \) and \( x \).
Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (N + 5x) - (N + x) = 265 - 97 \]
\[ 4x = 168 \]
\[ x = 42 \]
Substitute \( x = 42 \) back into the first equation:
\[ N + 42 = 97 \]
\[ N = 55 \]
Now, calculate the charge for a two-hour repair job:
\[ N + 2x = 55 + 2 \cdot 42 = 55 + 84 = 139 \]
Thus, the charge for a two-hour repair job is \( 139 \) dollars.
