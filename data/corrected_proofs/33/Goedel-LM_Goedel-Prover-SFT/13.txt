Given that Mr. Wrench charges a fixed amount \( N \) dollars for a plumbing repair job and charges \( x \) dollars per hour for the repair, we know the following:
- For a one-hour repair job, the total charge is \( 97 \) dollars.
- For a five-hour repair job, the total charge is \( 265 \) dollars.
We need to determine the total charge for a two-hour repair job.
From the given information, we can set up the following equations:
1. \( N + x = 97 \)
2. \( N + 5x = 265 \)
To find \( N + 2x \), we first solve for \( N \) and \( x \) using the given equations. Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:
\[ (N + 5x) - (N + x) = 265 - 97 \]
\[ 4x = 168 \]
\[ x = 42 \]
Substituting \( x = 42 \) back into the first equation:
\[ N + 42 = 97 \]
\[ N = 55 \]
Now, we calculate the total charge for a two-hour repair job:
\[ N + 2x = 55 + 2 \cdot 42 = 55 + 84 = 139 \]
Thus, the total charge for a two-hour repair job is \( 139 \) dollars.
