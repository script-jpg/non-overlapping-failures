Given the charges for two plumbing repair jobs, we need to determine the charge for a two-hour repair job. We know that Mr. Wrench charges \( N \) dollars for coming out to the house plus \( x \) dollars per hour that he works at the house. The total charge for a one-hour job is \( 97 \) dollars, and the total charge for a five-hour job is \( 265 \) dollars. We need to find the total charge for a two-hour job, which we will show to be \( 139 \) dollars.
First, we express the given conditions mathematically:
1. \( N + x = 97 \)
2. \( N + 5x = 265 \)
To find the total charge for a two-hour job, we need to solve for \( N \) and \( x \). We start by subtracting the first equation from the second to eliminate \( N \):
\[ (N + 5x) - (N + x) = 265 - 97 \]
\[ 4x = 168 \]
\[ x = 42 \]
Next, we substitute \( x = 42 \) back into the first equation to solve for \( N \):
\[ N + 42 = 97 \]
\[ N = 55 \]
Now, we calculate the total charge for a two-hour job:
\[ N + 2x = 55 + 2 \cdot 42 \]
\[ N + 2x = 55 + 84 \]
\[ N + 2x = 139 \]
Thus, the total charge for a two-hour job is \( 139 \) dollars.
