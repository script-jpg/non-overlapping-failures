Given the conditions:
1. For a one-hour repair job, Mr. Wrench charges \( n \) dollars for coming out to the house plus \( x \) dollars per hour that he works at the house.
2. The total cost for a one-hour repair job is \( 97 \) dollars.
3. The total cost for a five-hour repair job is \( 265 \) dollars.
We need to determine the cost for a two-hour repair job.
From the given conditions, we have the following equations:
\[ n + x = 97 \]
\[ n + 5x = 265 \]
First, we solve for \( n \) by subtracting the first equation from the second:
\[ (n + 5x) - (n + x) = 265 - 97 \]
\[ 4x = 168 \]
\[ x = 42 \]
Next, we substitute \( x = 42 \) back into the first equation to solve for \( n \):
\[ n + 42 = 97 \]
\[ n = 55 \]
Finally, we calculate the cost for a two-hour repair job:
\[ n + 2x = 55 + 2 \cdot 42 = 55 + 84 = 139 \]
Thus, the cost for a two-hour repair job is \( 139 \) dollars.
