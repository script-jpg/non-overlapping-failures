Given the charges for plumbing repair jobs:
- For a one-hour repair job, Mr. Wrench charges \( N \) dollars for the house visit and \( x \) dollars per hour worked.
- For a five-hour repair job, the total charge is \( \$265 \).
- For a two-hour repair job, the total charge is \( \$139 \).
We need to verify these charges by solving the system of equations:
1. \( N + x = 97 \)
2. \( N + 5x = 265 \)
First, we solve for \( N \) and \( x \) using the given equations. Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:
\[ (N + 5x) - (N + x) = 265 - 97 \]
\[ 4x = 168 \]
\[ x = 42 \]
Substituting \( x = 42 \) back into the first equation:
\[ N + 42 = 97 \]
\[ N = 55 \]
Now, we verify the charge for a two-hour repair job:
\[ N + 2x = 55 + 2 \times 42 = 55 + 84 = 139 \]
Thus, the charge for a two-hour repair job is indeed \( \$139 \).
