-- We need to find the value of n + 2 * x, which is the cost for a two-hour repair job.
have h₄ : n + 2 * x = 139 := by
  -- Using the given equations, we can solve for n and x.
  -- From h₀: n + x = 97
  -- From h₁: n + 5 * x = 265
  -- We can subtract h₀ from h₁ to eliminate n.

-- The value of n + 2 * x is 139, which completes the proof.
