  -- We need to find n + 2x. We can use the given equations to solve for n and x.
  -- From the first equation, n = 97 - x.
  -- Substitute n = 97 - x into the second equation: 97 - x + 5x = 265.
  -- Simplify: 97 + 4x = 265.
  -- Solve for x: 4x = 265 - 97 = 168.
  -- x = 168 / 4 = 42.
  -- Substitute x = 42 back into n = 97 - x: n = 97 - 42 = 55.
  -- Now, find n + 2x = 55 + 2 * 42 = 55 + 84 = 139.
