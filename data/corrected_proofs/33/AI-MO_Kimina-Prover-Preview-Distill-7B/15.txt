-- Solving the system of equations: $n + x = 97$ and $n + 5x = 265$
-- Subtract the first equation from the second to get $4x = 265 - 97 = 168$, so $x = 42$.

-- Substituting $x = 42$ back into the first equation: $n + 42 = 97$, so $n = 55$.
have hn : n = 55 := by linarith

-- Calculating the charge for a two-hour repair job: $n + 2x = 55 + 2 \cdot 42 = 55 + 84 = 139$.
