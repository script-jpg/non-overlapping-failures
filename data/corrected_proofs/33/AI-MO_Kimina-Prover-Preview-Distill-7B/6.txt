-- Subtracting the two equations, we get $4x = 265 - 97 = 168$, so $x = 42$.
have hx : x = 42 := by linarith

-- Substituting $x = 42$ into the first equation, we get $n + 42 = 97$, so $n = 55$.
have hn : n = 55 := by linarith

-- Therefore, for a two-hour repair job, Mr. Wrench would charge $n + 2x = 55 + 2 \cdot 42 = 55 + 84 = 139$ dollars.
