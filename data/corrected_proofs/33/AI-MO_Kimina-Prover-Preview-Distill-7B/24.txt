-- Solving the system of equations: Mr. Wrench's charge for a one-hour repair job is $97, which gives us the equation $n + x = 97$. For a five-hour repair job, he charges $265, giving us the equation $n + 5x = 265$. We need to find his charge for a two-hour repair job, which is $n + 2x$.

  -- Step 1: Subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate $n$ and solve for $x$.
  have eq1 : 4 * x = 168 := by linarith only [h₀, h₁]

  -- Step 2: Solve for $x$ by dividing both sides of the equation by 4.
  have hx : x = 42 := by linarith only [eq1]

  -- Step 3: Substitute the value of $x$ back into the first equation to solve for $n$.
  have hn : n = 55 := by linarith only [h₀, hx]

  -- Step 4: Calculate the charge for a two-hour repair job.
  linarith only [hn, hx]
