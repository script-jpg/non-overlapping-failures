Given three consecutive positive integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(b = a + 1\) and \(c = b + 1\), and the product of these integers is \(8\) times their sum, we need to show that the sum of their squares is \(77\).
1. Substitute \(b = a + 1\) and \(c = b + 1\) into the equation \(a \cdot b \cdot c = 8 \cdot (a + b + c)\).
2. Simplify the equation using the given relationships.
3. Solve the resulting equation using algebraic manipulation and linear arithmetic.
