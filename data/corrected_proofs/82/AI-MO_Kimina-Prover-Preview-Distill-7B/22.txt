-- The problem is to solve the congruence $3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}$, as a residue modulo 11.  (Give an answer between 0 and 10.) Show that it is 8.

  -- Since 3 and 11 are coprime, the congruence has a unique solution modulo 11.
  have h₁ : n % 11 = 8 := by
    -- Since 3 and 11 are coprime, the congruence has a unique solution modulo 11.
    -- We check that n = 8 is the solution.
