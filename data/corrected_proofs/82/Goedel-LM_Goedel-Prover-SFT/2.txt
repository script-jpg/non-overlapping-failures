To solve the congruence \(3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\), we need to find the value of \(n\) modulo 11 such that the congruence holds. We start by expressing \(n\) in the form \(n = 11k + r\) where \(r\) is the remainder when \(n\) is divided by 11. Substituting this into the congruence, we get:
\[ 3(11k + r) \equiv 2 \pmod{11} \]
Simplifying this, we have:
\[ 33k + 3r \equiv 2 \pmod{11} \]
Since \(33k \equiv 0 \pmod{11}\), we are left with:
\[ 3r \equiv 2 \pmod{11} \]
We need to find \(r\) such that \(3r \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\). By solving this congruence, we find that \(r = 8\) satisfies the equation:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \equiv 2 \pmod{11} \]
Thus, \(n \equiv 8 \pmod{11}\).
