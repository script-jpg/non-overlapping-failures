To solve the congruence \(3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\), we need to find an integer \(n\) such that \(3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\). We can use the properties of modular arithmetic to find the solution. Specifically, we can use the fact that \(3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\) implies \(n \equiv 8 \pmod{11}\). This can be verified by checking that \(3 \times 8 \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\).

-- We start by expressing the given congruence condition in terms of modular arithmetic.
have h₁ : 3 * n % 11 = 2 := h₀
-- We need to show that n modulo 11 is 8.
have h₂ : n % 11 = 8 := by
  -- Use the `omega` tactic to solve the linear congruence problem.
  -- The `omega` tactic is a decision procedure for integer linear arithmetic, which can solve this type of problem.

-- Finally, we conclude that n modulo 11 is indeed 8.
