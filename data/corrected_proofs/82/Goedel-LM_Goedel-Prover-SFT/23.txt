To solve the congruence \(3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\), we need to find an integer \(n\) such that \(3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\). We can test values of \(n\) modulo 11 to find a solution. By testing \(n = 8\), we find that \(3 \times 8 = 24 \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\), confirming that \(n \equiv 8 \pmod{11}\).

-- We use the `omega` tactic to solve the congruence by testing possible values of `n` modulo 11.
-- The `omega` tactic is a decision procedure for integer linear arithmetic, which will find the solution by testing values of `n` modulo 11.
