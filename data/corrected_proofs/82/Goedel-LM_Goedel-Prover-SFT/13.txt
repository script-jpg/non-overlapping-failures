To solve the congruence \(3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\), we need to find the value of \(n\) modulo 11 such that \(3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\). We can use the fact that \(3\) and \(11\) are coprime, which allows us to find an inverse of \(3\) modulo \(11\). The inverse of \(3\) modulo \(11\) is \(4\) because \(3 \times 4 \equiv 1 \pmod{11}\). Multiplying both sides of the congruence \(3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\) by \(4\), we get \(n \equiv 8 \pmod{11}\). Therefore, the solution to the congruence is \(n \equiv 8 \pmod{11}\).
