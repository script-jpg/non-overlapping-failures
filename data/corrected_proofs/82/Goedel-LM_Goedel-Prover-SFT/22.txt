To solve the congruence \(3n \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\), we need to find the value of \(n\) modulo 11 that satisfies this congruence. We start by expressing \(n\) in the form \(n = 11k + r\) where \(r\) is the remainder when \(n\) is divided by 11. Substituting \(n\) into the congruence, we get:
\[ 3(11k + r) \equiv 2 \pmod{11} \]
Simplifying this, we have:
\[ 33k + 3r \equiv 2 \pmod{11} \]
Since \(33k \equiv 0 \pmod{11}\), this reduces to:
\[ 3r \equiv 2 \pmod{11} \]
We need to find \(r\) such that \(3r \equiv 2 \pmod{11}\). By testing values of \(r\) from 0 to 10, we find that \(r = 8\) satisfies this congruence:
\[ 3 \times 8 = 24 \equiv 2 \pmod{11} \]
Thus, \(n \equiv 8 \pmod{11}\).

  -- We know that n can be written as n = 11k + r where r is the remainder when n is divided by 11.
  -- Substituting n into the congruence, we get 3(11k + r) ≡ 2 (mod 11).
  -- Simplifying this, we have 33k + 3r ≡ 2 (mod 11).
  -- Since 33k ≡ 0 (mod 11), this reduces to 3r ≡ 2 (mod 11).
  -- We need to find r such that 3r ≡ 2 (mod 11).
  -- By testing values of r from 0 to 10, we find that r = 8 satisfies this congruence.
  -- Thus, n ≡ 8 (mod 11).
  -- We can use the fact that 3 * 8 % 11 = 2 to directly conclude that n % 11 = 8.

-- We have already derived that n % 11 = 8, so we can directly use this result.
