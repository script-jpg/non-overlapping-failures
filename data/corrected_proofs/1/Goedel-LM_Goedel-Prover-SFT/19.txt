We aim to show that there are no integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( 4x^3 - 7y^3 = 2003 \). To prove this, we will use modular arithmetic to show that the equation \( 4x^3 - 7y^3 = 2003 \) cannot hold for any integers \( x \) and \( y \).
1. Assume for contradiction that there exist integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( 4x^3 - 7y^3 = 2003 \).
2. Consider the equation modulo 7. We will check all possible values of \( x \) and \( y \) modulo 7 to see if the equation holds.
3. By examining all combinations of \( x \) and \( y \) modulo 7, we will show that the equation \( 4x^3 - 7y^3 \equiv 2003 \pmod{7} \) is never satisfied.
4. Since the equation modulo 7 is never satisfied, it implies that the original equation \( 4x^3 - 7y^3 = 2003 \) has no integer solutions.
