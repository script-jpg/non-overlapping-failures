To show that there are no integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( 4x^3 - 7y^3 = 2003 \), we proceed as follows:

1. Assume for contradiction that there exist integers \( x \) and \( y \) satisfying the equation.
2. Consider the equation modulo 7. We analyze the possible values of \( x \) and \( y \) modulo 7.
3. By examining the possible values of \( x \) and \( y \) modulo 7, we find that the equation \( 4x^3 - 7y^3 = 2003 \) modulo 7 leads to a contradiction.
4. Since the equation modulo 7 is always false, it implies that there are no integer solutions to the equation.
