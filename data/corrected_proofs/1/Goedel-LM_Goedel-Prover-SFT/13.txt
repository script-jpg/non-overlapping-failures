To show that there are no integers \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( 4x^3 - 7y^3 = 2003 \), we proceed as follows:

1. Assume for contradiction that there exist integers \( x \) and \( y \) satisfying \( 4x^3 - 7y^3 = 2003 \).
2. Consider the equation modulo 7. We analyze the possible values of \( x^3 \) and \( y^3 \) modulo 7.
3. By examining the cubes of integers modulo 7, we find that \( 4x^3 - 7y^3 \) can only be congruent to 0, 1, or -1 modulo 7.
4. However, 2003 modulo 7 is 2, which is a contradiction.
5. Therefore, there are no integers \( x \) and \( y \) satisfying \( 4x^3 - 7y^3 = 2003 \).
