Given the equations \(3x + y = 17\), \(5y + z = 14\), and \(3x + 5z = 41\), we need to find the value of the sum \(x + y + z\). We will show that it is 12.
First, we manipulate the given equations to isolate the variables \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\). By adding the equations \(3x + y = 17\) and \(5y + z = 14\), we can eliminate \(x\) and solve for \(y + z\). Similarly, by adding the equations \(3x + y = 17\) and \(3x + 5z = 41\), we can eliminate \(y\) and solve for \(x + z\). Finally, by adding the equations \(5y + z = 14\) and \(3x + 5z = 41\), we can eliminate \(z\) and solve for \(x + y\).
After manipulating the equations, we find that \(x + y + z = 12\).
