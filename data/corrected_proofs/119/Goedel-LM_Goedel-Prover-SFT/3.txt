Given the equations \(3x + y = 17\), \(5y + z = 14\), and \(3x + 5z = 41\), we need to find the value of the sum \(x + y + z\). By solving these equations simultaneously, we can determine the values of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) and then verify that their sum is 12.
First, we solve for \(x\) using the first two equations. By isolating \(y\) and \(z\), we can derive a relationship that simplifies to a single equation involving \(x\). Solving this equation yields \(x\).
Next, we substitute the value of \(x\) back into the first equation to find \(y\).
Finally, we use the derived values of \(x\) and \(y\) to compute \(z\) and then verify that \(x + y + z = 12\).
