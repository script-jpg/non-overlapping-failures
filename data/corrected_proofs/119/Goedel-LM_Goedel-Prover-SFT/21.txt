Given the equations \(3x + y = 17\), \(5y + z = 14\), and \(3x + 5z = 41\), we need to find the value of the sum \(x + y + z\). By solving these equations step by step, we can determine the values of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) that satisfy all three equations. Finally, we will sum these values to verify that the sum is indeed 12.
