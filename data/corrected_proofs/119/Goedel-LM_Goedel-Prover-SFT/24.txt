Given the equations \(3x + y = 17\), \(5y + z = 14\), and \(3x + 5z = 41\), we need to find the value of the sum \(x + y + z\). By solving these equations step by step, we can determine the values of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) and subsequently verify that their sum is 12.
1. Start with the first equation: \(3x + y = 17\).
2. Use the second equation: \(5y + z = 14\).
3. Use the third equation: \(3x + 5z = 41\).
By solving these equations, we can find the values of \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) and then compute \(x + y + z\).
