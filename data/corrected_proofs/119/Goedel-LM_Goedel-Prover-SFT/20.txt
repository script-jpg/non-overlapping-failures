Given the equations \(3x + y = 17\), \(5y + z = 14\), and \(3x + 5z = 41\), we need to find the value of the sum \(x + y + z\). We will show that it equals 12.
First, we manipulate the first equation by subtracting 17 from both sides, resulting in \(3x + y - 17 = 0\). This can be rewritten as \(3x + y = 17\).
Next, we manipulate the second equation by subtracting 14 from both sides, resulting in \(5y + z - 14 = 0\). This can be rewritten as \(5y + z = 14\).
Then, we manipulate the third equation by subtracting 41 from both sides, resulting in \(3x + 5z - 41 = 0\). This can be rewritten as \(3x + 5z = 41\).
Now, we have the system of equations:
1. \(3x + y = 17\)
2. \(5y + z = 14\)
3. \(3x + 5z = 41\)
We can solve this system using linear algebra techniques. By manipulating the equations, we can isolate \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\).
From the first equation, we can express \(y\) in terms of \(x\):
\[ y = 17 - 3x \]
Substitute \(y = 17 - 3x\) into the second equation:
\[ 5(17 - 3x) + z = 14 \]
\[ 85 - 15x + z = 14 \]
\[ z = 14 - 85 + 15x \]
\[ z = 15x - 71 \]
Substitute \(y = 17 - 3x\) and \(z = 15x - 71\) into the third equation:
\[ 3x + 5(15x - 71) = 41 \]
\[ 3x + 75x - 355 = 41 \]
\[ 78x - 355 = 41 \]
\[ 78x = 396 \]
\[ x = \frac{396}{78} \]
\[ x = \frac{66}{13} \]
Now, substitute \(x = \frac{66}{13}\) back into the expressions for \(y\) and \(z\):
\[ y = 17 - 3 \left(\frac{66}{13}\right) \]
\[ y = 17 - \frac{198}{13} \]
\[ y = \frac{221}{13} - \frac{198}{13} \]
\[ y = \frac{23}{13} \]
\[ z = 15 \left(\frac{66}{13}\right) - 71 \]
\[ z = \frac{990}{13} - 71 \]
\[ z = \frac{990}{13} - \frac{923}{13} \]
\[ z = \frac{67}{13} \]
Finally, calculate the sum \(x + y + z\):
\[ x + y + z = \frac{66}{13} + \frac{23}{13} + \frac{67}{13} \]
\[ x + y + z = \frac{66 + 23 + 67}{13} \]
\[ x + y + z = \frac{156}{13} \]
\[ x + y + z = 12 \]
