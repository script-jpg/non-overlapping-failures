-- Given the equations $3x+y=17,5y+z=14$ and $3x+5z=41$, what is the value of the sum $x+y+z$? Show that it is 12.

  -- We need to find the value of x+y+z

  -- Let's add all three equations:
  -- (3x+y) + (5y+z) + (3x+5z) = 17 + 14 + 41
  -- 6x+6y+6z = 72
  -- x+y+z = 12

  have h3 : 6 * x + 6 * y + 6 * z = 72 := by linarith

  -- Now divide both sides by 6:
  -- x+y+z = 12
