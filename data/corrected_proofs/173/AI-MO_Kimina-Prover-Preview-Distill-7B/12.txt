-- We need to find the remainder when the sum of the marbles is divided by 10.
-- Sally: 239 marbles
-- Wei-Hwa: 174 marbles
-- Zoe: 83 marbles
-- Total marbles: 239 + 174 + 83
-- Calculate the total: 239 + 174 = 413; 413 + 83 = 496
-- Find 496 % 10
-- The remainder when 496 is divided by 10 is 6, since 496 = 49 * 10 + 6
