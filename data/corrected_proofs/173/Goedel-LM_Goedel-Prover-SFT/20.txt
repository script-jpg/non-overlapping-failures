To determine how many marbles must be removed to start the game, we need to find the remainder when the total number of marbles is divided by 10. The total number of marbles is the sum of Sally's, Wei-Hwa's, and Zoe's marbles. We calculate the sum of these numbers and then find its remainder when divided by 10.
Given:
- Sally has 239 marbles.
- Wei-Hwa has 174 marbles.
- Zoe has 83 marbles.
First, we sum these numbers:
\[ 239 + 174 + 83 = 496 \]
Next, we find the remainder of 496 when divided by 10:
\[ 496 \div 10 = 49 \text{ remainder } 6 \]
Thus, the remainder is 6. Therefore, 6 marbles must be removed to start the game.

-- Using the `norm_num` tactic, we compute the sum of the numbers and then find its remainder when divided by 10.
-- The result is 6, which confirms that 6 marbles must be removed to start the game.
