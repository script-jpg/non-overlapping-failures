To solve the problem, we need to determine how many marbles to remove to make the total number of marbles a multiple of 10. The total number of marbles is given by the sum of Sally's, Wei-Hwa's, and Zoe's marbles. We calculate the sum of these numbers and then find the remainder when divided by 10 to determine the number of marbles that must be removed.
1. Sally brought 239 marbles.
2. Wei-Hwa brought 174 marbles.
3. Zoe brought 83 marbles.
First, we sum these numbers:
\[ 239 + 174 + 83 = 496 \]
Next, we find the remainder of 496 when divided by 10:
\[ 496 \div 10 = 49 \text{ remainder } 6 \]
Thus, the remainder is 6, which means 6 marbles must be removed to make the total number of marbles a multiple of 10.
