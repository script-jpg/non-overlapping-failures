To determine how many marbles must be removed to start the game, we first calculate the total number of marbles Sally, Wei-Hwa, and Zoe have. Given that Sally brought 239 marbles, Wei-Hwa brought 174 marbles, and Zoe brought 83 marbles, the total number of marbles is \(239 + 174 + 83 = 496\).
Next, we need to find the remainder when 496 is divided by 10. This can be done using modular arithmetic. We calculate \(496 \mod 10\).
Since \(496 \div 10 = 49\) with a remainder of 6, we have \(496 \equiv 6 \mod 10\). Therefore, the number of marbles that must be removed to start the game is 6.
