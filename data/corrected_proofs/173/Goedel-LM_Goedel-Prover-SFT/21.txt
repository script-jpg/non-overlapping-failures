To determine the number of marbles that need to be removed to start the game, we first calculate the total number of marbles brought by Sally, Wei-Hwa, and Zoe. The total is \(239 + 174 + 83 = 496\). We then find the remainder when 496 is divided by 10. This is calculated as \(496 \mod 10\), which simplifies to 6. Therefore, 6 marbles need to be removed to start the game.
