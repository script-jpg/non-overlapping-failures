To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of marbles that must be removed to start the game. Given that Sally brought 239 marbles, Wei-Hwa brought 174 marbles, and Zoe brought 83 marbles, we need to find the total number of marbles and determine the remainder when divided by 10.
First, we calculate the total number of marbles:
\[ 239 + 174 + 83 = 496 \]
Next, we find the remainder of 496 when divided by 10:
\[ 496 \div 10 = 49 \text{ remainder } 6 \]
Thus, the remainder is 6, which means 6 marbles must be removed to start the game.
