To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of marbles that must be removed to start the game. The game involves arranging marbles into piles of 10. We are given the number of marbles each player has: Sally has 239 marbles, Wei-Hwa has 174 marbles, and Zoe has 83 marbles. We need to find the remainder when the total number of marbles is divided by 10. This is because we need to determine how many marbles must be removed to start the game.

First, we calculate the total number of marbles:
\[ 239 + 174 + 83 = 496 \]
Next, we find the remainder when 496 is divided by 10:
\[ 496 \div 10 = 49 \text{ remainder } 6 \]
Thus, the remainder is 6. Therefore, 6 marbles must be removed to start the game.
