To determine how many marbles must be removed from the total of 239, 174, and 83 marbles to start the game, we need to find the remainder when the sum of these numbers is divided by 10. We start by calculating the sum of the numbers:
\[ 239 + 174 + 83 = 506 \]
Next, we find the remainder of 506 when divided by 10:
\[ 506 \div 10 = 50 \text{ remainder } 6 \]
Thus, the remainder is 6. Therefore, 6 marbles must be removed to start the game.

-- We need to show that the sum of 239, 174, and 83 modulo 10 is 6.
-- First, we calculate the sum of these numbers:
-- 239 + 174 + 83 = 506
-- Next, we find the remainder of 506 when divided by 10:
-- 506 % 10 = 6
