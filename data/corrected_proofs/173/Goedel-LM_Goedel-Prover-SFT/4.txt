To determine the number of marbles that need to be removed to start the game, we need to find the remainder when the total number of marbles is divided by 10. Given that Sally brought 239 marbles, Wei-Hwa brought 174 marbles, and Zoe brought 83 marbles, we calculate the total number of marbles as follows:
\[ 239 + 174 + 83 = 496 \]
Next, we find the remainder of 496 when divided by 10:
\[ 496 \div 10 = 49 \text{ remainder } 6 \]
Thus, the number of marbles that need to be removed to start the game is 6.
