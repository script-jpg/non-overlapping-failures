To determine how many marbles must be removed to start the game, we need to find the remainder when the total number of marbles is divided by 10. The total number of marbles is 239 + 174 + 83. We calculate the sum of these numbers and then find the remainder when divided by 10.
1. Calculate the sum of the marbles: \( 239 + 174 + 83 = 506 \).
2. Find the remainder of 506 when divided by 10: \( 506 \mod 10 = 6 \).
Thus, 6 marbles must be removed to start the game.
