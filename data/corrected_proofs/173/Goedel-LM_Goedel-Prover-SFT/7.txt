To determine how many marbles Sally, Wei-Hwa, and Zoe must remove to start the game, we need to find the remainder when the total number of marbles is divided by 10. The total number of marbles is the sum of Sally's, Wei-Hwa's, and Zoe's marbles. We are given the following:
- Sally brought 239 marbles
- Wei-Hwa brought 174 marbles
- Zoe brought 83 marbles
First, we calculate the total number of marbles:
\[ 239 + 174 + 83 = 506 \]
Next, we find the remainder when 506 is divided by 10:
\[ 506 \div 10 = 50 \text{ remainder } 6 \]
Thus, the remainder is 6. Therefore, the number of marbles that must be removed to start the game is 6.
