Given a positive integer \( X \) that is 2 more than a multiple of 3, and its units digit is the same as the units digit of a number that is 4 more than a multiple of 5, we need to find the smallest possible value of \( X \) and show that it is 14.

-- We start by expressing \( X \) in terms of its remainder when divided by 10.
have h₀' := Nat.mod_add_div x 10
-- Simplify the expression using the given conditions and properties of modular arithmetic.
simp_all only [Nat.add_comm, Nat.add_assoc, Nat.add_left_comm]
-- Use the `omega` tactic to solve the resulting linear integer arithmetic problem.
