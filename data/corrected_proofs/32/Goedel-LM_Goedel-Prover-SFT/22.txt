To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( X \) such that \( X \) is 2 more than a multiple of 3 and its units digit is the same as the units digit of a number that is 4 more than a multiple of 5. We will show that the smallest such \( X \) is 14.
1. **Condition Analysis**:
   - \( X \) is 2 more than a multiple of 3. This implies \( X \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \).
   - The units digit of \( X \) is the same as the units digit of \( 4 + 5k \) for some integer \( k \).
2. **Possible Values**:
   - If \( X \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \), then \( X \) can be written as \( 3m + 2 \) for some integer \( m \).
   - The units digit of \( X \) must match the units digit of \( 4 + 5k \).
3. **Range of \( X \)**:
   - Since \( X \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \), \( X \) must be at least 2 more than a multiple of 3.
   - We need to find the smallest \( X \) such that \( X \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \) and the units digit condition is satisfied.
4. **Verification**:
   - We test values of \( X \) starting from 2 that are 2 more than a multiple of 3.
   - We find that \( X = 14 \) satisfies both conditions:
     - \( 14 \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \)
     - The units digit of 14 is 4, which matches the units digit of \( 4 + 5k \) for some \( k \).
5. **Conclusion**:
   - The smallest positive integer \( X \) that satisfies both conditions is 14.

have h₃ : 2 ≤ x := by
  -- Use the fact that x % 3 = 2 to show that x is at least 2 more than a multiple of 3.
  omega
have h₄ : 0 ≤ x % 10 := by
  -- The units digit of x is a natural number, so it is non-negative.

have h₅ : 14 ≤ x := by
  -- Use the omega tactic to solve the system of congruences and inequalities.
