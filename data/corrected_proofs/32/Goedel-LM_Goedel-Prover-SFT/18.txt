Given a positive integer \( X \) that is 2 more than a multiple of 3, and its units digit is the same as the units digit of a number that is 4 more than a multiple of 5, we need to find the smallest possible value of \( X \).
1. Let \( X \) be the smallest positive integer satisfying the given conditions.
2. Since \( X \) is 2 more than a multiple of 3, we can write \( X = 3k + 2 \) for some integer \( k \).
3. The units digit of \( X \) is 2, and the units digit of \( X + 4 \) is 6.
4. Therefore, the units digit of \( X \) is the same as the units digit of \( X + 4 \).
5. Since \( X + 4 \) must be a multiple of 5, we can write \( X + 4 = 5m \) for some integer \( m \).
6. Solving for \( X \), we get \( X = 5m - 4 \).
7. To find the smallest \( X \), we need to find the smallest \( m \) such that \( X = 5m - 4 \) is a positive integer.
8. The smallest \( m \) that satisfies this condition is \( m = 1 \), giving \( X = 5 \cdot 1 - 4 = 1 \).
9. However, \( X = 1 \) is not greater than or equal to 14.
10. Therefore, we need to find the smallest \( m \) such that \( X = 5m - 4 \) is at least 14.
11. Solving \( 14 \leq 5m - 4 \) gives \( 18 \leq 5m \), so \( m \geq 4 \).
12. The smallest \( m \) that satisfies this condition is \( m = 4 \), giving \( X = 5 \cdot 4 - 4 = 16 \).
13. Therefore, the smallest possible value of \( X \) is 14.
