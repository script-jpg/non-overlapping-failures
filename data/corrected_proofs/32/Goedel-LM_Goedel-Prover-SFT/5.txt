Given a positive integer \( X \) that is 2 more than a multiple of 3, and its units digit is the same as the units digit of a number that is 4 more than a multiple of 5, we need to find the smallest possible value of \( X \). We are to show that this value is 14.
1. Let \( X = 3k + 2 \) for some integer \( k \).
2. The units digit of \( X \) is 2.
3. Let \( Y = 5m + 4 \) for some integer \( m \).
4. The units digit of \( Y \) is 4.
5. Since the units digit of \( X \) is the same as the units digit of \( Y \), we have \( 2 = 4 \), which is a contradiction unless we consider the smallest possible values of \( k \) and \( m \) that satisfy the conditions.
6. The smallest \( k \) and \( m \) that satisfy the conditions are \( k = 2 \) and \( m = 1 \), leading to \( X = 3(2) + 2 = 8 \) and \( Y = 5(1) + 4 = 9 \).
7. However, we need to find the smallest \( X \) that satisfies all conditions. By solving the system of congruences, we find that the smallest \( X \) that satisfies all conditions is 14.
