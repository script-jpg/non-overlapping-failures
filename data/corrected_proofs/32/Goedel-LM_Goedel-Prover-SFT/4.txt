Given a positive integer \( X \) that is 2 more than a multiple of 3, and its units digit is the same as the units digit of a number that is 4 more than a multiple of 5, we need to determine the smallest possible value of \( X \). We are to show that the smallest possible value of \( X \) is 14.
1. From the given conditions, we know:
   - \( X \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \)
   - \( X \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \)
   - \( X \equiv y \pmod{10} \) for some integer \( y \)
2. We need to find the smallest \( X \) that satisfies these conditions.
3. Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we solve the system of congruences:
   - \( X = 3k + 2 \) for some integer \( k \)
   - \( X = 5m + 4 \) for some integer \( m \)
4. Equating the two expressions for \( X \):
   - \( 3k + 2 = 5m + 4 \)
   - \( 3k - 5m = 2 \)
5. Solving the linear Diophantine equation \( 3k - 5m = 2 \):
   - The general solution is \( k = 5p + 4 \) and \( m = 3p + 2 \) for some integer \( p \).
6. Substituting \( k \) back into the expression for \( X \):
   - \( X = 3(5p + 4) + 2 = 15p + 14 \)
7. Therefore, \( X \equiv 14 \pmod{15} \).
8. The smallest positive \( X \) that satisfies all conditions is 14.
