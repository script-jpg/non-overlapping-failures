Given a positive integer \( X \) that is 2 more than a multiple of 3, and its units digit is the same as the units digit of a number that is 4 more than a multiple of 5, we need to find the smallest possible value of \( X \) and show that it is 14.
1. Let \( X = 3k + 2 \) for some integer \( k \).
2. The units digit of \( X \) is 2.
3. Let \( Y = 5m + 4 \) for some integer \( m \).
4. The units digit of \( Y \) is 4.
5. Since the units digit of \( X \) is the same as the units digit of \( Y \), we have \( 2 = 4 \), which is a contradiction unless \( X \) and \( Y \) are considered modulo 10.
6. Given \( X \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \) and \( Y \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \), we need to find the smallest \( X \) that satisfies these conditions.
7. By solving the system of congruences, we find that \( X \equiv 14 \pmod{15} \).
8. Therefore, the smallest possible value of \( X \) is 14.

-- We know that x % 3 = 2, so x can be written as 3k + 2 for some integer k.
have h₃ : x % 3 = 2 := by assumption
-- We know that y % 5 = 4, so y can be written as 5m + 4 for some integer m.
have h₄ : y % 5 = 4 := by assumption
-- We know that the units digit of x is the same as the units digit of y.
have h₅ : x % 10 = y % 10 := by assumption
-- We need to show that 14 ≤ x.
