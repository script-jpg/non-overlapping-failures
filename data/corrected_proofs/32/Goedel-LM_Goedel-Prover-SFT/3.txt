To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( X \) that satisfies the following conditions:
1. \( X \) is 2 more than a multiple of 3.
2. The units digit of \( X \) is the same as the units digit of a number that is 4 more than a multiple of 5.
We are given that \( X \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \) and \( X \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \). We need to find the smallest \( X \) that satisfies both congruences.
First, we express \( X \) in terms of its residues modulo 3 and 5:
\[ X = 3k + 2 \]
\[ X = 5m + 4 \]
Equating the two expressions for \( X \):
\[ 3k + 2 = 5m + 4 \]
\[ 3k - 5m = 2 \]
We need to find the smallest positive integer \( k \) and \( m \) that satisfy this equation. We can solve this linear Diophantine equation by finding particular solutions and then using the general solution form.
By inspection, we find that \( k = 2 \) and \( m = 1 \) is a particular solution:
\[ 3(2) - 5(1) = 6 - 5 = 1 \]
However, we need to adjust for the fact that we need \( X \) to be the smallest positive integer. The general solution is:
\[ k = 5p + 2 \]
\[ m = 3p + 1 \]
Substituting back to find \( X \):
\[ X = 3(5p + 2) + 2 = 15p + 8 \]
To ensure \( X \) is the smallest positive integer, we set \( p = 0 \):
\[ X = 15(0) + 8 = 8 \]
However, we need to check if this value satisfies the original conditions. Since \( 8 \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \) and \( 8 \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \), it does not satisfy both conditions. Therefore, we need to find the smallest \( X \) that does.
By solving the system of congruences, we find that the smallest positive integer \( X \) that satisfies both conditions is 14.
