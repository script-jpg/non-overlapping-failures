Given that \( X \) is a positive integer such that \( X \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \), and the units digit of \( X \) is the same as the units digit of a number that is 4 more than a multiple of 5, we need to find the smallest possible value of \( X \). We are to show that this value is at least 14.
1. From the condition \( X \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \), we know that \( X = 3k + 2 \) for some integer \( k \).
2. The units digit of \( X \) is the same as the units digit of \( 3k + 4 \).
3. Since \( 3k \equiv 0 \pmod{10} \), the units digit of \( X \) is the same as the units digit of 4.
4. The smallest positive integer \( X \) that satisfies \( X \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \) and \( X \equiv 4 \pmod{10} \) is 14.
Thus, the smallest possible value of \( X \) is indeed 14.

  -- Use the fact that X % 10 = Y % 10 to find the smallest X that satisfies both conditions.

  -- If X < 14, then we can find a contradiction by checking the conditions for X < 14.
  have : x % 10 = 4 := by
    -- Solve the system of congruences using the omega tactic.

  -- The result shows that X % 10 cannot be 4 if X < 14, leading to a contradiction.
  omega
-- Therefore, 14 ≤ X.
