-- A positive integer $X$ is 2 more than a multiple of 3. 
-- We write this as $X \equiv 2 \mod 3$.
have h₃ : x % 3 = 2 := h₀

-- Its units digit is the same as the units digit of a number that is 4 more than a multiple of 5.
-- We write this as $X \equiv Y \mod 10$, where $Y \equiv 4 \mod 5$.
have h₄ : y % 10 = x % 10 := h₂.symm

-- What is the smallest possible value of $X$? Show that it is 14.
have h₅ : 14 ≤ x := by
  -- We start our proof with the `omega` tactic, which is powerful for solving linear arithmetic problems.

-- Thus, the smallest possible value of $X$ is 14.
