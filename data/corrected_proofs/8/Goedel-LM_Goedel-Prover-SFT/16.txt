To find the units digit \( n \) of the four-digit number \( \underline{374n} \) such that it is divisible by 18, we need to ensure that the number \( 374n \) is divisible by 18. This can be achieved by checking the divisibility condition and solving for \( n \).
1. **Divisibility Condition**: The number \( 374n \) must be divisible by 18. This means that the number \( 374n \) must be divisible by both 2 and 9.
2. **Divisibility by 2**: Since \( 374n \) is even, it is divisible by 2. The last digit of \( 374n \) is \( n \), so \( n \) must be even. The possible even values for \( n \) are 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8.
3. **Divisibility by 9**: The sum of the digits of \( 374n \) must be divisible by 9. The sum of the digits of \( 374n \) is \( 3 + 7 + 4 + n = 14 + n \). We need \( 14 + n \) to be divisible by 9.
4. **Solving for \( n \)**: We need \( 14 + n \equiv 0 \pmod{9} \). Since \( 14 \equiv 5 \pmod{9} \), we have \( 5 + n \equiv 0 \pmod{9} \), which simplifies to \( n \equiv 4 \pmod{9} \).
Thus, the only possible value for \( n \) that satisfies both conditions is \( n = 4 \).
