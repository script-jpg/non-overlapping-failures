To find the units digit \( n \) of the four-digit number \( 374n \) such that it is divisible by 18, we need to follow these steps:
1. Express the number \( 374n \) in terms of \( n \).
2. Use the property that \( 374n \) is divisible by 18 to set up an equation.
3. Solve the equation to find the value of \( n \).
Given that \( 374n \) is divisible by 18, we can write the equation:
\[ 374n \equiv 0 \pmod{18} \]
First, we simplify \( 374 \mod 18 \):
\[ 374 \div 18 = 20 \text{ remainder } 14 \]
Thus,
\[ 374 \equiv 14 \pmod{18} \]
So the equation becomes:
\[ 14n \equiv 0 \pmod{18} \]
This implies that \( n \) must be such that \( 14n \) is a multiple of 18. We can solve for \( n \) by finding the multiplicative inverse of 14 modulo 18. The inverse of 14 modulo 18 is 14, because:
\[ 14 \times 14 \equiv 1 \pmod{18} \]
Thus, multiplying both sides of the equation \( 14n \equiv 0 \pmod{18} \) by 14, we get:
\[ n \equiv 0 \pmod{18} \]
Since \( n \) is a single digit, the only solution is \( n = 4 \).
