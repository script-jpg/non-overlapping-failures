To solve the problem, we need to determine the units digit \( n \) of the four-digit number \( 374n \) such that it is divisible by 18. We will show that \( n = 4 \) satisfies this condition.
1. **Divisibility by 18**: A number is divisible by 18 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 9.
2. **Divisibility by 2**: The last digit of the number \( 374n \) is \( n \). For \( 374n \) to be divisible by 2, \( n \) must be even.
3. **Divisibility by 9**: The sum of the digits of \( 374n \) is \( 3 + 7 + 4 + n = 14 + n \). For \( 374n \) to be divisible by 9, \( 14 + n \) must be divisible by 9.
4. **Solving for \( n \)**: We need \( 14 + n \) to be divisible by 9. The possible values for \( n \) are 0 through 9. Checking each value, we find that \( n = 4 \) is the only solution that satisfies this condition.
