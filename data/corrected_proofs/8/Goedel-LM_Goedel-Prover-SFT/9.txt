To find the units digit \( n \) such that the four-digit number \( \underline{374n} \) is divisible by 18, we need to ensure that \( \underline{374n} \) is divisible by both 3 and 6. 
1. **Divisibility by 6**: Since \( \underline{374n} \) must be divisible by 6, it must be divisible by both 2 and 3. The last digit \( n \) must be even.
2. **Divisibility by 3**: The sum of the digits of \( \underline{374n} \) must be divisible by 3. The sum of the known digits is \( 3 + 7 + 4 = 14 \). Therefore, \( 14 + n \) must be divisible by 3.
Given these conditions, we check the possible even digits for \( n \) that make \( 14 + n \) divisible by 3:
- \( n = 0 \) (not divisible by 3)
- \( n = 2 \) (not divisible by 3)
- \( n = 4 \) (divisible by 3, and even)
- \( n = 6 \) (not divisible by 3)
- \( n = 8 \) (not divisible by 3)
Thus, the only even digit that satisfies both conditions is \( n = 4 \).
