-- The four-digit number $374n$ is divisible by 18. Find the units digit $n$. Show that it is 4.

  -- We need to find the digit $n$ (from 0 to 9) that makes the number 374n divisible by 18.

  have : 18 ∣ 374 * 10 + n := h₁

  -- 18 divides 3740 + n. So, 3740 + n = 18 * m for some m.

  have : n = 4 := by

    -- Since n is a digit from 0 to 9, we can check each case to see which one satisfies the divisibility condition.

    omega

  -- After checking all possible values for n from 0 to 9, we find that only n = 4 satisfies the condition that 3740 + n is divisible by 18.
