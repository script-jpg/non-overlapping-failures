Given the equations:
1. \( x_1 + 4x_2 + 9x_3 + 16x_4 + 25x_5 + 36x_6 + 49x_7 = 1 \)
2. \( 4x_1 + 9x_2 + 16x_3 + 25x_4 + 36x_5 + 49x_6 + 64x_7 = 12 \)
3. \( 9x_1 + 16x_2 + 25x_3 + 36x_4 + 49x_5 + 64x_6 + 81x_7 = 123 \)
We need to find the value of \( 16x_1 + 25x_2 + 36x_3 + 49x_4 + 64x_5 + 81x_6 + 100x_7 \).
By examining the patterns in the coefficients and the right-hand sides of the equations, we can observe that the right-hand sides are perfect squares of the corresponding coefficients. This suggests a relationship between the sums of the coefficients and the squares of the coefficients.
Using the given equations, we can derive the required value by leveraging the relationships between the sums of the coefficients and the squares of the coefficients. Specifically, we can use the fact that the sums of the coefficients and the squares of the coefficients are related in a way that allows us to solve for the required sum.
