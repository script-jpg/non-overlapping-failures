We aim to show that the statement "for any integers \(a\) and \(b\), \(a\) and \(b\) are both even if and only if \(8 \mid a^2 + b^2\)" is false. To prove this, we will demonstrate that the statement is not universally true by providing a counterexample.
1. Assume the statement is true for all integers \(a\) and \(b\).
2. Consider the specific case where \(a = 2\) and \(b = 2\).
3. Verify that \(a\) and \(b\) are both even, as \(2\) is even.
4. Check that \(8 \mid 2^2 + 2^2\), which simplifies to \(8 \mid 8\).
5. Since \(8 \mid 8\) is true, this case serves as a counterexample to the original statement.
6. Conclude that the original statement is not universally true, thus proving the negation.
