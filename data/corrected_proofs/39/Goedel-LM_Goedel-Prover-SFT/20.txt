We aim to show that the statement "For any integers \(a\) and \(b\), \(a\) and \(b\) are both even if and only if \(8 \mid a^2 + b^2\)" is false. To prove this, we will use the method of contradiction.
1. Assume the statement is true and derive a contradiction.
2. Consider the specific case where \(a = 2\) and \(b = 2\).
3. Check the conditions for \(a\) and \(b\) being even and the divisibility of \(a^2 + b^2\) by 8.
4. Simplify the expression \(a^2 + b^2\) for these values.
5. Observe that the result does not match the divisibility condition, leading to a contradiction.
