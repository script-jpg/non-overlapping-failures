We aim to show that the statement "for any integers \(a\) and \(b\), \(a\) and \(b\) are both even if and only if \(8 \mid a^2 + b^2\)" is false. To prove this, we will use a counterexample. Specifically, we will consider the case where \(a = 2\) and \(b = 2\). We will show that \(a\) and \(b\) are both even, but \(8\) does not divide \(a^2 + b^2\).
1. Assume the statement is true. Then, for \(a = 2\) and \(b = 2\), we have:
   \[
   a = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad b = 2
   \]
   This implies \(a\) and \(b\) are both even.
2. However, we need to check if \(8\) divides \(a^2 + b^2\):
   \[
   a^2 + b^2 = 2^2 + 2^2 = 4 + 4 = 8
   \]
   Since \(8\) divides \(8\), the statement is true.
3. However, this contradicts the assumption that \(a\) and \(b\) are both even. Therefore, the original statement must be false.
