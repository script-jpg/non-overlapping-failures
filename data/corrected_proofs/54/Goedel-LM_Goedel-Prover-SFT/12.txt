To determine the units digit of \(2^{2010}\), we can focus on the pattern of the units digits of powers of 2. The units digits of powers of 2 follow a cycle of 4: \(2, 4, 8, 6\). Specifically:
- \(2^1 = 2\) (units digit is 2)
- \(2^2 = 4\) (units digit is 4)
- \(2^3 = 8\) (units digit is 8)
- \(2^4 = 16\) (units digit is 6)
- \(2^5 = 32\) (units digit is 2)
- and so on...
Given this cycle, we can determine the units digit of \(2^{2010}\) by finding the position of 2010 in the cycle. Since the cycle length is 4, we calculate the remainder of 2010 divided by 4:
\[ 2010 \div 4 = 502 \text{ remainder } 2 \]
Thus, \(2010 \equiv 2 \pmod{4}\). This means \(2^{2010}\) has the same units digit as \(2^2\), which is 4.

  -- The cycle length is 4, so we find the position of 2010 in the cycle.
  -- 2010 % 4 = 2, so the units digit of 2^2010 is the same as the units digit of 2^2.
