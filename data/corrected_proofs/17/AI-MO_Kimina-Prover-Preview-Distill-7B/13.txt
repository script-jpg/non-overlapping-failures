-- The stragglers have taken a and b from the context variables.
-- They are now defined in the scope, and we have to prove the goal.
-- We can either take the long way and prove a = -1 ∧ b = 5 → -39, then use assumption
-- to get the value of a and b from the context variables. Or we can use the
-- the more simple way and use the "rw" tactic to rewrite a and b in the goal,
-- and then prove the resulting equation.
rw [h₀, h₁]
-- The goal now is to show that -(-1) - 5^2 + 3 * (-1 * 5) = -39
-- or, after simplification: 1 - 25 - 15 = -39.
