To determine the least positive integer \( n \) such that \( 80325 \) divides \( n! \), we need to find the smallest \( n \) for which \( n! \) is a multiple of \( 80325 \). We start by factoring \( 80325 \) into its prime factors:
\[ 80325 = 3^2 \times 5^3 \times 19 \]
Thus, \( n! \) must be divisible by \( 3^2 \times 5^3 \times 19 \). This implies that \( n \) must have at least:
\[ n \geq 2 \times 3 + 3 \times 5 + 1 \times 19 = 6 + 15 + 19 = 30 \]
However, we need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( 80325 \) divides \( n! \). By checking the smallest values, we find that \( n = 17 \) is the smallest for which \( 80325 \) divides \( 17! \).
