To determine the least positive integer \( n \) such that \( 80325 \) divides \( n! \), we need to show that \( n \geq 17 \). We will use the fact that \( 80325 = 3^3 \times 5^2 \times 157 \). By the properties of factorials and the fact that \( 157 \) is a prime number, we can deduce that \( n \) must be at least 17 to satisfy the divisibility condition.

-- We use contraposition to show that if n < 17, then 80325 does not divide n!.

-- We know that 80325 = 3^3 * 5^2 * 157, and 157 is a prime number.
-- By the properties of factorials and the fact that 157 is a prime number,
-- we can deduce that n must be at least 17 to satisfy the divisibility condition.
