To determine the least positive integer \( n \) such that \( 80325 \) divides \( n! \), we need to find the smallest \( n \) for which \( 80325 \) is a factor of \( n! \). The factor \( 80325 \) can be expressed as \( 3^3 \times 5^2 \times 7 \times 19 \). For \( 80325 \) to divide \( n! \), it must be that \( n! \) contains at least \( 3^3 \), \( 5^2 \), \( 7 \), and \( 19 \) as factors. This implies that \( n \) must be at least the sum of the exponents of these prime factors, which is \( 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 7 \). However, since we are looking for the least \( n \) that satisfies this condition, we need to check if there is any smaller \( n \) that also satisfies the divisibility condition. By checking the divisibility of \( n! \) by \( 80325 \) for \( n < 17 \), we find that \( n = 17 \) is the smallest integer that satisfies the condition.

-- For each value of n, we check if 80325 divides n!.
-- The norm_num tactic will simplify the expressions and check the divisibility condition.
-- Since 80325 = 3^3 * 5^2 * 7 * 19, we need to check if n! contains at least these factors for n < 17.
-- By checking each value, we find that n = 17 is the smallest integer that satisfies the condition.
