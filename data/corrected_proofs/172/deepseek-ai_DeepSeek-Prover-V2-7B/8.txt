have h₁ : x = 5 := by
  have h₂ : 3 / 2 / 3 = x / 10 := h₀
  have h₃ : x = 5 := by
    -- We need to solve the equation 3 / 2 / 3 = x / 10 for x.
    -- First, simplify the left side: 3 / 2 / 3 = 1 / 2.
    norm_num at h₂
    -- Now the equation is 1 / 2 = x / 10.
    -- Cross-multiplying gives 10 * (1 / 2) = x, which simplifies to 5 = x.
