Given that Jasmine drank 1.5 pints of water on the first 3 miles of her hike, we need to determine how many pints of water she would drink in the next 10 miles if she continued at this rate. We start by expressing the rate of water consumption as a ratio and then use this rate to find the total water consumption for a 10-mile hike.
1. The rate of water consumption is given by the ratio of the water consumed in the first 3 miles to the time taken for these miles.
2. We set up the equation based on the given rate and solve for the total water consumption in the next 10 miles.
3. By simplifying the equation, we find that the total water consumption is 5 pints.
