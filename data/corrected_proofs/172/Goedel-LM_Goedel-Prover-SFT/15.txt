Given that Jasmine drank 1.5 pints of water on the first 3 miles of her hike, and she continued at this rate, we need to determine how many pints of water she would drink in the next 10 miles. We are given the equation \( \frac{3}{2} \div 3 = \frac{x}{10} \), where \( x \) represents the number of pints of water in the next 10 miles. We need to solve for \( x \) and show that it equals 5.
First, simplify the left-hand side of the equation:
\[ \frac{3}{2} \div 3 = \frac{3}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{3 \times 1}{2 \times 3} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]
Thus, the equation becomes:
\[ \frac{1}{2} = \frac{x}{10} \]
Next, solve for \( x \) by cross-multiplying:
\[ 10 \times \frac{1}{2} = x \]
\[ 5 = x \]
Therefore, the number of pints of water Jasmine would drink in the next 10 miles is \( x = 5 \).
