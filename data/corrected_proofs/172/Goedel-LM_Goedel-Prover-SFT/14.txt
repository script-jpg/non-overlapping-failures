Given that Jasmine drank 1.5 pints of water on the first 3 miles of her hike, we need to determine how many pints of water she would drink in the next 10 miles at this rate. We start by setting up the proportion:
\[
\frac{3}{2} \div 3 = \frac{x}{10}
\]
First, simplify the left-hand side:
\[
\frac{3}{2} \div 3 = \frac{3}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
Thus, the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{x}{10}
\]
To solve for \( x \), multiply both sides by 10:
\[
x = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5
\]
Therefore, Jasmine would drink 5 pints of water in the next 10 miles.
