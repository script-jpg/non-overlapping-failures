Given that Jasmine drank 1.5 pints of water on the first 3 miles of her hike, we need to determine how many pints of water she would drink in the next 10 miles at this same rate. We start by calculating the rate and then use it to find the total amount of water consumed in the next 10 miles.
1. **Calculate the rate**: Jasmine drank 1.5 pints of water on the first 3 miles.
2. **Determine the rate per mile**: The rate is \( \frac{1.5 \text{ pints}}{3 \text{ miles}} = 0.5 \text{ pints per mile} \).
3. **Calculate the total water consumed in the next 10 miles**: Using the rate of 0.5 pints per mile, the total water consumed in 10 miles is \( 10 \text{ miles} \times 0.5 \text{ pints per mile} = 5 \text{ pints} \).
Thus, Jasmine would drink 5 pints of water in the next 10 miles.
