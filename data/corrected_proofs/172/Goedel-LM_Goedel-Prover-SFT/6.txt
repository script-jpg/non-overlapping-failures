Given that Jasmine drank 1.5 pints of water on the first 3 miles of her hike, we need to determine how many pints of water she would drink in the next 10 miles if she continued at this rate. We are given the equation:
\[
\frac{3}{2} \div 3 = \frac{x}{10}
\]
First, we simplify the left-hand side of the equation:
\[
\frac{3}{2} \div 3 = \frac{3}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
Thus, the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{x}{10}
\]
To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by 10:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 10 = x
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
5 = x
\]
Therefore, Jasmine would drink 5 pints of water in the next 10 miles.
