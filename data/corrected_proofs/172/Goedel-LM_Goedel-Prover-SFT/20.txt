Given that Jasmine drank \( \frac{3}{2} \) pints of water on the first 3 miles of her hike, we need to determine how many pints of water she would drink in the next 10 miles if she continued at this rate. We are given the equation \( \frac{3}{2} \div 3 = \frac{x}{10} \). To solve for \( x \), we first simplify the left-hand side of the equation by dividing \( \frac{3}{2} \) by 3, which results in \( \frac{1}{2} \). Thus, the equation becomes \( \frac{1}{2} = \frac{x}{10} \). To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by 10, yielding \( x = 5 \).

-- We start by simplifying the given equation 3 / 2 / 3 = x / 10
have h₁ : x = 5 := by
  -- Simplify the left-hand side of the equation: 3 / 2 / 3 = 1 / 2

  -- Now we have 1 / 2 = x / 10
  -- Solve for x by multiplying both sides by 10

-- We have found that x = 5, so we can conclude the proof
