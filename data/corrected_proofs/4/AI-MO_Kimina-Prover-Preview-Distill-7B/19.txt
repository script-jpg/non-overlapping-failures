-- We need to prove that $a^2 + b^2 = 369$.

  have h₃ : a + b = 27 := by linarith

  -- We have $a + b = 27$.

  have h₄ : a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 = (a + b) ^ 2 - 2 * (a * b) := by ring

  -- We have $a^2 + b^2 = (a + b)^2 - 2ab$.

  -- Substituting $a + b = 27$ and $a * b = 180$ into the equation, we get $a^2 + b^2 = 27^2 - 2 * 180 = 729 - 360 = 369$.
