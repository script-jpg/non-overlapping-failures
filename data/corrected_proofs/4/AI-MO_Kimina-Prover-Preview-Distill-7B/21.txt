-- We start by noting that the area of the patio is given by the equation $a \cdot b = 180$.

-- To find $a^2 + b^2$, we can use the identity $(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$.
-- We know $a + b = 27$, so $(a + b)^2 = 27^2 = 729$.

-- From the identity $(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$, we have $a^2 + b^2 = (a + b)^2 - 2ab$.
-- We have $ab = 180$ from the area, so $2ab = 2 \cdot 180 = 360$.

-- Substituting the values we have: $a^2 + b^2 = 729 - 2 \cdot 180 = 729 - 360 = 369$.
