Given a rectangular patio with an area of 180 square feet and a perimeter of 54 feet, we need to show that the length of the diagonal (in feet) squared is 369.
1. From the perimeter condition, we derive that the sum of the lengths of the sides \(a\) and \(b\) is 27 feet.
2. We then use the Pythagorean theorem to express the square of the diagonal as \(a^2 + b^2\).
3. Finally, we verify that \(a^2 + b^2\) indeed equals 369 by leveraging the given conditions and algebraic manipulations.

-- From the perimeter condition, derive that the sum of the lengths of the sides is 27 feet.
have h₃ : a + b = 27 := by linarith
-- Use the Pythagorean theorem to express the square of the diagonal as a^2 + b^2.
have h₄ : a ^ 2 + b ^ 2 = (a + b) ^ 2 - 2 * (a * b) := by ring
-- Substitute the known values of a + b and a * b into the equation.
rw [h₃, h₁] at h₄
-- Verify that a^2 + b^2 equals 369 by simplifying the expression.
