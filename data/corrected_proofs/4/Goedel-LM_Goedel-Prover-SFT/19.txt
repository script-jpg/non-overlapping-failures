Given a rectangular patio with an area of 180 square feet and a perimeter of 54 feet, we need to find the length of the diagonal in feet and show that it is 369.
1. From the perimeter condition, we derive the sum of the sides \(a + b = 27\).
2. We use the Pythagorean theorem to express the diagonal \(d\) in terms of the sides: \(d = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\).
3. Squaring both sides of the diagonal equation, we get \(d^2 = a^2 + b^2\).
4. We need to find \(a^2 + b^2\). Using the identity \((a + b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab\), we substitute the known values: \(729 = a^2 + b^2 + 360\).
5. Solving for \(a^2 + b^2\), we get \(a^2 + b^2 = 729 - 360 = 369\).
Thus, the length of the diagonal squared is \(369\).
