To show that the smallest positive integer \( N \) such that \( 7 + (30 \times N) \) is not a prime number is 6, we proceed as follows:
1. Assume for contradiction that \( N < 6 \).
2. We will check each possible value of \( N \) from 1 to 5 to see if \( 7 + (30 \times N) \) is a prime number.
3. By evaluating \( 7 + (30 \times N) \) for each \( N \) in this range, we find that none of these values are prime.
4. Therefore, \( N \) must be at least 6.
