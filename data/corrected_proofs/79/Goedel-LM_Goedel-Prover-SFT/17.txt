To solve the problem, we start by calculating the new dimensions and area of the square after the changes. The original side length of the square is 3491. The length is decreased by 60, and the width is increased by 60. Thus, the new length is \(3491 - 60 = 3431\), and the new width is \(3491 + 60 = 3551\).
Next, we compute the new area using the formula for the area of a square:
\[
\text{New Area} = \text{New Length} \times \text{New Width} = 3431 \times 3551
\]
We also calculate the original area of the square:
\[
\text{Original Area} = 3491 \times 3491
\]
To find the change in area, we subtract the original area from the new area:
\[
\text{Change in Area} = \text{New Area} - \text{Original Area} = 3431 \times 3551 - 3491 \times 3491
\]
Simplifying this expression, we get:
\[
\text{Change in Area} = 3431 \times 3551 - 3491 \times 3491 = 3431 \times 3551 - 3491 \times 3491 = 3431 \times 3551 - 3491 \times 3491 = 3600
\]
Thus, the area of the square changes by 3600.
