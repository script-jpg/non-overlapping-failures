To show that the area of a 3491 by 3491 square changes by 3600 when its length is decreased by 60 and its width is increased by 60, we start by expressing the new dimensions and the new area. The new length is \(3491 - 60\) and the new width is \(3491 + 60\). The new area is calculated as \((3491 - 60) \times (3491 + 60)\). The original area is \(3491 \times 3491\). The change in area is the difference between the new area and the original area. We then simplify the expression for the change in area and verify that it equals 3600.
