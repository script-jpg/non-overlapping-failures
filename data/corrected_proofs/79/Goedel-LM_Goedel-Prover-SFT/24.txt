To solve the problem, we need to calculate the area of a square with a side length of 3491 and then adjust this area by subtracting 60 units from the length and adding 60 units to the width. We aim to find the change in area.
1. Start by calculating the original area of the square:
   \[
   \text{Original Area} = 3491^2
   \]
2. Calculate the new area after decreasing the length by 60 and increasing the width by 60:
   \[
   \text{New Area} = (3491 - 60) \times (3491 + 60)
   \]
3. Find the difference between the new area and the original area:
   \[
   \text{Change in Area} = (3491 - 60) \times (3491 + 60) - 3491^2
   \]
4. Simplify the expression:
   \[
   \text{Change in Area} = 3491^2 - 3491 \times 3491
   \]
5. Recognize that the expression simplifies to:
   \[
   \text{Change in Area} = -3491 \times 3491
   \]
6. Calculate the final value:
   \[
   \text{Change in Area} = 3600
   \]
