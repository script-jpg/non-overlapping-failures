To solve the problem, we start by calculating the new dimensions and new area of the square. The new length is \(3491 - 60\) and the new width is \(3491 + 60\). The new area is then calculated as \((3491 - 60) \times (3491 + 60)\). We then subtract the original area \(3491^2\) from this new area to find the change in area. Finally, we verify that the absolute value of this change is 3600.

-- Calculate the new length and width
-- New length = 3491 - 60
-- New width = 3491 + 60
-- Calculate the new area and the change in area
-- New area = (3491 - 60) * (3491 + 60)
-- Change in area = New area - Original area
-- Verify that the absolute value of the change in area is 3600
