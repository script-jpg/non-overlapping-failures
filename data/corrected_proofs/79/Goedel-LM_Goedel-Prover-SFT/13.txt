To show that the area of the 3491 by 3491 square changes by 3600 when its length is decreased by 60 and its width is increased by 60, we proceed as follows:
1. Calculate the new length and width:
   - New length: \( 3491 - 60 = 3431 \)
   - New width: \( 3491 + 60 = 3551 \)
2. Compute the original area and the new area:
   - Original area: \( 3491 \times 3491 \)
   - New area: \( 3431 \times 3551 \)
3. Determine the change in area:
   - Change in area: \( 3431 \times 3551 - 3491 \times 3491 \)
4. Simplify the expression to show that the change in area is 3600.
