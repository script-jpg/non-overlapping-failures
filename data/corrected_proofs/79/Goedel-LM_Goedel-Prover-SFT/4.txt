We need to show that the absolute value of the difference between the area of a \(3491 \times 3491\) square and the area of a \(3431 \times 3551\) square is 3600. This can be achieved by directly computing the expression and verifying the result.

-- We use the `norm_num` tactic to perform numerical computations and simplify the expression.
norm_num [abs_of_nonneg]
-- The `norm_num` tactic will compute the value of the expression and verify that it equals 3600.
-- Specifically, it will compute (3491 - 60) * (3491 + 60) - 3491^2 and check that the absolute value of this result is 3600.
