Given the relationships:
1. \( 7 \text{ ligs} = 4 \text{ lags} \)
2. \( 9 \text{ lags} = 20 \text{ lugs} \)
We need to find the number of ligs equivalent to 80 lugs.
First, we express the relationships in terms of equations:
\[ 7a = 4b \]
\[ 9b = 20c \]
From these equations, we can derive:
\[ a = \frac{4b}{7} \]
\[ b = \frac{20c}{9} \]
Substituting \( b \) in terms of \( c \) into the expression for \( a \):
\[ a = \frac{4 \left( \frac{20c}{9} \right)}{7} = \frac{80c}{63} \]
Thus, the number of ligs equivalent to 80 lugs is:
\[ 63a = 80c \]
