Given the relationships:
1. \( 7 \text{ ligs} = 4 \text{ lags} \)
2. \( 9 \text{ lags} = 20 \text{ lugs} \)
We need to find how many ligs are equivalent to 80 lugs.
First, we express the relationships in terms of equations:
\[ 7a = 4b \]
\[ 9b = 20c \]
To find the relationship between ligs and lugs, we solve for \( a \) in terms of \( c \):
\[ a = \frac{4b}{7} \]
\[ b = \frac{20c}{9} \]
Substitute \( b \) into the expression for \( a \):
\[ a = \frac{4 \left( \frac{20c}{9} \right)}{7} = \frac{80c}{63} \]
Thus, \( 63a = 80c \), confirming that 63 ligs are equivalent to 80 lugs.
