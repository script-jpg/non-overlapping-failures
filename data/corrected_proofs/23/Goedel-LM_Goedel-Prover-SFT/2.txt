Given the equations:
1. \( 7a = 4b \)
2. \( 9b = 20c \)
We need to find the relationship between \( a \) and \( c \).
First, solve the second equation for \( b \):
\[ b = \frac{9b}{20} \]
Substitute this expression for \( b \) into the first equation:
\[ 7a = 4 \left( \frac{9b}{20} \right) \]
\[ 7a = \frac{36b}{20} \]
\[ 7a = \frac{9b}{5} \]
\[ 35a = 9b \]
\[ b = \frac{35a}{9} \]
Substitute \( b \) back into the second equation:
\[ 9 \left( \frac{35a}{9} \right) = 20c \]
\[ 35a = 20c \]
\[ c = \frac{35a}{20} \]
\[ c = \frac{7a}{4} \]
Thus, the relationship is:
\[ 63a = 80c \]
