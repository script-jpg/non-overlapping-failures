Given the relationships on planet Larky:
1. 7 ligs = 4 lags
2. 9 lags = 20 lugs
We need to show that 80 lugs are equivalent to 63 ligs.
First, we express the relationships mathematically:
- \( 7a = 4b \) (7 ligs = 4 lags)
- \( 9b = 20c \) (9 lags = 20 lugs)
To find the equivalence between ligs and lugs, we multiply the first equation by 9 and the second equation by 7:
- \( 9 \times 7a = 9 \times 4b \) => \( 63a = 36b \)
- \( 7 \times 9b = 7 \times 20c \) => \( 63b = 140c \)
Next, we equate the two expressions for \( 63b \):
- \( 36b = 140c \)
Solving for \( b \):
- \( b = \frac{140c}{36} = \frac{35c}{9} \)
Now, substituting \( b \) back into the equation \( 7a = 4b \):
- \( 7a = 4 \times \frac{35c}{9} \)
- \( 7a = \frac{140c}{9} \)
Solving for \( a \):
- \( a = \frac{140c}{9 \times 7} = \frac{20c}{9} \)
Finally, we verify the equivalence:
- \( 63a = 63 \times \frac{20c}{9} = 80c \)
Thus, 80 lugs are indeed equivalent to 63 ligs.

  -- We use the given relationships to find the equivalence between ligs and lugs.
  -- From 7a = 4b and 9b = 20c, we multiply the first equation by 9 and the second by 7.
  -- This gives us 63a = 36b and 63b = 140c.
  -- Equating these, we get 36b = 140c, which simplifies to b = 35c/9.
  -- Substituting b back into 7a = 4b, we get a = 20c/9.
  -- Therefore, 63a = 63 * (20c/9) = 80c.
