-- The given conditions are 9 lags = 20 lugs, 7 ligs = 4 lags, and we need to find how many ligs = 80 lugs.

-- First, we cancel the units to get a relation between ligs and lugs.

have h₃ : 63 * a = 80 * c := by

  -- Multiply both sides of 7 ligs = 4 lags by 9 to get 63 ligs = 36 lags

  linarith only [h₁, h₂]

-- Now, we conclude the proof by exactly the relation we need.

exact h₃
