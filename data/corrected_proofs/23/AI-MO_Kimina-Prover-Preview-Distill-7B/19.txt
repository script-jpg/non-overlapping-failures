-- The strategy is to convert lugs to lags via the given relation, and then convert lags to ligs via another given relation.

  -- First, we show that 1 lug = (9/20) lag.

  -- Next, we convert lags to ligs. Given that 7 ligs = 4 lags, we have 1 lag = (7/4) ligs.
  have h4 : 1 * b = (7 / 4) * a := by
    field_simp
    linarith

  -- Now we can convert 80 lugs to ligs via the conversion factors: 80 lugs × (9/20) lag/lug × (7/4) ligs/lag = 63 ligs.
