-- We will complete the square for both $x$ and $y$ to rewrite the equation
-- in the standard form of a circle $(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2$.

-- For $x$, the terms $x^2 + 8x$ can be rewritten by completing the square as $(x + 4)^2 - 16$.
have : x ^ 2 + 8 * x = (x + 4) ^ 2 - 16 := by ring

-- For $y$, the terms $y^2 - 6y$ can be rewritten by completing the square as $(y - 3)^2 - 9$.
have : y ^ 2 - 6 * y = (y - 3) ^ 2 - 9 := by ring

-- Substituting these into the original equation, we get:
have : (x + 4) ^ 2 - 16 + (y - 3) ^ 2 - 9 = 0 := by linarith

-- Simplifying, we get the standard form of a circle with center $(-4, 3)$ and radius $5$.
have : (x + 4) ^ 2 + (y - 3) ^ 2 = 5 ^ 2 := by linarith
