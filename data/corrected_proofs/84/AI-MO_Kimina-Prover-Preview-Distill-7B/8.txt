-- We will complete the square to find the radius of the circle.
-- For the $x$ terms: $x^2 + 8x$, we take half of the coefficient of $x$, which is $8/2 = 4$, and then square it to get $4^2 = 16$.
-- For the $y$ terms: $y^2 - 6y$, we take half of the coefficient of $y$, which is $-6/2 = -3$, and then square it to get $(-3)^2 = 9$.
-- Thus, we can rewrite the equation as: $(x^2 + 8x + 16) + (y^2 - 6y + 9) = 16 + 9$.
-- This simplifies to: $(x + 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 25$.
-- The right-hand side is $5^2 = 25$, so the radius of the circle is 5.

-- Use algebraic manipulation to show that the given equation can be rewritten as $(x + 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 5^2$.
