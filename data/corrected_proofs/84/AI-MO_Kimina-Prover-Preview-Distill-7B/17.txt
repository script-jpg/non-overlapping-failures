-- We will complete the square for both $x$ and $y$.
-- For $x$, we have $x^2 + 8x$. To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of $x$, which is $8/2 = 4$, and then square it to get $4^2 = 16$.
-- For $y$, we have $y^2 - 6y$. Similarly, we take half of the coefficient of $y$, which is $-6/2 = -3$, and then square it to get $(-3)^2 = 9$.
-- So we rewrite the equation as $x^2 + 8x + 16 + y^2 - 6y + 9 = 16 + 9$.
-- This simplifies to $(x + 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 25$.
-- The left hand side is the sum of two squares, which represents a circle in the $xy$-plane. The right hand side is $5^2$, so the radius of the circle is 5.
