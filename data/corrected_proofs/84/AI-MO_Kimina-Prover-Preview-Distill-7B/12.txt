-- We will find the radius of the circle given by the equation $x^2 + 8x + y^2 - 6y = 0$.

-- The radius can be found by rewriting the equation in standard form by completing the square.
-- For the $x$ terms: $x^2 + 8x$, we take half of the coefficient of $x$, which is $8/2 = 4$, and then square it to get $4^2 = 16$.
-- For the $y$ terms: $y^2 - 6y$, we take half of the coefficient of $y$, which is $-6/2 = -3$, and then square it to get $(-3)^2 = 9$.

-- Adding and subtracting these squares to complete the square:
-- \begin{align*}
-- x^2 + 8x + y^2 - 6y &= 0 \\
-- (x^2 + 8x + 16) + (y^2 - 6y + 9) &= 16 + 9 \\
-- (x + 4)^2 + (y - 3)^2 &= 25 \\
-- \end{align*}

-- The equation represents a circle centered at $(-4, 3)$ with radius $5$.
