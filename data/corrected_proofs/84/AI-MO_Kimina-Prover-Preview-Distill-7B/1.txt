-- We will complete the square for both $x$ and $y$.
-- For $x$, we have $x^2 + 8x$. To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of $x$, which is $8$, giving us $4$, and then square it to get $16$.
-- For $y$, we have $y^2 - 6y$. Similarly, we take half of the coefficient of $y$, which is $-6$, giving us $-3$, and then square it to get $9$.

  (x + 4) ^ 2 + (y - 3) ^ 2 = ((x ^ 2 + 8 * x + 16) + (y ^ 2 - 6 * y + 9)) := by ring
  -- Now, we can rewrite the equation by adding $16$ and $9$ to the right-hand side.
  _ = (x ^ 2 + 8 * x + y ^ 2 - 6 * y) + 16 + 9 := by ring
  -- Substitute $x^2 + 8x + y^2 - 6y = 0$ into the equation.
  _ = 0 + 16 + 9 := by rw [h₀]
  -- Evaluate the numerical expression.
