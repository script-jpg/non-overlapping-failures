-- We will complete the square for both $x$ and $y$ terms.
-- For $x$, we have $x^2 + 8x$. To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of $x$, which is $8/2 = 4$, and then square it to get $4^2 = 16$.
-- For $y$, we have $y^2 - 6y$. Similarly, we take half of the coefficient of $y$, which is $-6/2 = -3$, and then square it to get $(-3)^2 = 9$.
-- So we add and subtract these squares to both sides of the equation.
