To prove that \((x+1)^2 \cdot x = x^3 + 2x^2 + x\), we start by expanding the left-hand side of the equation. First, we expand \((x+1)^2\) to get \(x^2 + 2x + 1\). Then, we multiply this result by \(x\) to obtain \((x^2 + 2x + 1) \cdot x\). This simplifies to \(x^3 + 2x^2 + x\), which matches the right-hand side of the equation.
