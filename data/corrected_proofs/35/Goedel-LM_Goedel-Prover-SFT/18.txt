To prove that \((x+1)^2 \cdot x = x^3 + 2x^2 + x\), we start by expanding the left-hand side of the equation. First, we compute \((x+1)^2\), which gives us \(x^2 + 2x + 1\). Next, we multiply this result by \(x\), resulting in \((x^2 + 2x + 1) \cdot x = x^3 + 2x^2 + x\). This matches the right-hand side of the equation, confirming the equality.
