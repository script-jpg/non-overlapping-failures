To prove that \((x+1)^2 \cdot x = x^3 + 2x^2 + x\), we start by expanding the expression on the left-hand side. First, we expand \((x+1)^2\) using the binomial theorem, which gives us \(x^2 + 2x + 1\). Then, we multiply this result by \(x\), yielding \((x^2 + 2x + 1) \cdot x\). This multiplication can be simplified to \(x^3 + 2x^2 + x\), which matches the right-hand side of the equation.
