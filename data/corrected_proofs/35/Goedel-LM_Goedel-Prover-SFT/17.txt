To prove that \((x+1)^2 \cdot x = x^3 + 2x^2 + x\), we start by expanding the left-hand side of the equation. First, we compute \((x+1)^2\), which is \(x^2 + 2x + 1\). Then, we multiply this result by \(x\), yielding \((x^2 + 2x + 1) \cdot x = x^3 + 2x^2 + x\). This directly matches the right-hand side of the equation, confirming the equality.
