To show that the smallest integer greater than 10 that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube is 64, we proceed as follows:
1. **Existence of Square and Cube**: Given that \( n \) is a perfect square and a perfect cube, there exist integers \( x \) and \( t \) such that \( x^2 = n \) and \( t^3 = n \).
2. **Lower Bound**: We need to show that \( n \geq 64 \).
3. **Simplification**: Using the properties of squares and cubes, we can derive the smallest possible values for \( n \) that satisfy both conditions.
4. **Verification**: By checking the smallest values, we find that \( n = 64 \) is indeed the smallest number that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube.
