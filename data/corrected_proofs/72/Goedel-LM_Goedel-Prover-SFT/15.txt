To show that the smallest integer greater than 10 that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube is 64, we start by considering the given conditions. Let \( n \) be a natural number such that \( 10 \leq n \). We are given that \( n \) is a perfect square, meaning there exists an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 = n \), and \( n \) is also a perfect cube, meaning there exists an integer \( t \) such that \( t^3 = n \).
We need to prove that \( 64 \leq n \). To do this, we will use the fact that the smallest perfect square greater than 10 is 16, and the smallest perfect cube greater than 10 is 8. Since \( n \) must be both a perfect square and a perfect cube, it must be a multiple of both 16 and 8, which is 64.
