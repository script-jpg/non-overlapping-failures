To show that the smallest integer greater than 10 that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube is 64, we proceed as follows:
1. Let \( n \) be the number in question.
2. Given \( 10 \leq n \), we know \( n \) is at least 10.
3. Since \( n \) is a perfect square, there exists an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 = n \).
4. Similarly, since \( n \) is a perfect cube, there exists an integer \( t \) such that \( t^3 = n \).
5. We need to find the smallest \( n \) that satisfies both conditions.
6. By examining the properties of perfect squares and perfect cubes, we find that the smallest \( n \) that is a perfect square and a perfect cube is 64.
7. Therefore, \( 64 \leq n \).

-- Using the fact that x and t are less than 8 and 4 respectively, we can find a contradiction
