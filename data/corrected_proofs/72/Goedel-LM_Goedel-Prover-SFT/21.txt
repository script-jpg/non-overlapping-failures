To show that the smallest integer greater than 10 that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube is 64, we proceed as follows:
 1. Let \( n \) be the integer in question, which is greater than or equal to 10.
 2. Given that \( n \) is a perfect square, there exists an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 = n \).
 3. Similarly, given that \( n \) is a perfect cube, there exists an integer \( t \) such that \( t^3 = n \).
 4. We need to show that \( n \geq 64 \).
 5. From the given conditions, we can express \( n \) as \( x^2 \) and \( t^3 \).
 6. To find the smallest such \( n \), we consider the smallest perfect squares and cubes greater than or equal to 10.
 7. The smallest perfect square greater than or equal to 10 is \( 8^2 = 64 \).
 8. The smallest perfect cube greater than or equal to 10 is \( 4^3 = 64 \).
 9. Therefore, the smallest integer \( n \) that satisfies both conditions is 64.

   -- If n < 64, then we have a contradiction because the smallest perfect square and cube greater than or equal to 10 are both 64.
