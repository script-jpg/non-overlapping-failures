To show that the smallest integer greater than 10 that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube is 64, we proceed as follows:
1. Assume \( n \) is a natural number such that \( 10 \leq n \).
2. Assume \( n \) is a perfect square, so there exists an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 = n \).
3. Assume \( n \) is also a perfect cube, so there exists an integer \( t \) such that \( t^3 = n \).
4. We need to show that \( 64 \leq n \).
Given the constraints, we can use the properties of perfect squares and perfect cubes to derive the lower bound. Specifically, we know that the smallest perfect square greater than 10 is 16, and the smallest perfect cube greater than 10 is 64. Since \( n \) must be both a perfect square and a perfect cube, it must be at least 64.
