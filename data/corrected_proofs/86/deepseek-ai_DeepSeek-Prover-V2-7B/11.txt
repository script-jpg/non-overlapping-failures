have h : x = 18 := by
  /-
  To solve for \( x \), we can use the given equations:
  
  \[ x + y = 25 \]
  \[ x - y = 11 \]
  
  First, we can add the two equations together to eliminate \( y \):
  
  \[ (x + y) + (x - y) = 25 + 11 \]
  \[ 2x = 36 \]
  \[ x = 18 \]
  
  Thus, the value of \( x \) is \( 18 \).
