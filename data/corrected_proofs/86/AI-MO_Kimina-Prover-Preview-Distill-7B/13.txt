-- According to the problem, we have two equations: \\(x + y = 25\\) and \\(x - y = 11\\).
-- We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the value of \\(x\\).
have : x = 18 := by linarith

-- To demonstrate the reasoning process more explicitly, we can use the `have` command
-- to establish an intermediate result. Here, we're deriving that \\(x = 18\\) from our two equations.
