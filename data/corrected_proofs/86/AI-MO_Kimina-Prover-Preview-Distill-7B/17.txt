-- According to the problem, we have two equations: $x + y = 25$ and $x - y = 11$.
-- We can solve this system of equations to find the value of $x$.
-- By adding the two equations, we get: $(x + y) + (x - y) = 25 + 11$, which simplifies to $2x = 36$.
have h2 : 2 * x = 36 := by linarith
-- Solving for $x$, we divide both sides by 2, yielding $x = 18$.
