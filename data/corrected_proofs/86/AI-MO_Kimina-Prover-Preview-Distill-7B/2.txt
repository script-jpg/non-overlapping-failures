-- According to the problem, we have two equations: the sum of two numbers is 25, and their difference is 11.
-- We need to find the value of the larger number, which is $x$.
-- We can solve this by adding the two equations.
have h : x = 18 := by linarith
-- The linarith tactic is powerful for solving linear arithmetic goals. It takes the hypotheses h₀ and h₁,
-- adds them together, and derives that x = 18. This is because:
-- x + y = 25
-- x - y = 11
-- Adding these equations: (x + y) + (x - y) = 25 + 11
-- 2x = 36
-- x = 18
