-- According to the problem, we have two equations: \\(x + y = 25\\) and \\(x - y = 11\\).
-- We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the value of \\(x\\).
have h₂ : x = 18 := by linarith

-- The key insight is that we can add these two equations:
-- \\[
--   \begin{align*}
--     x + y &= 25 \\
--     x - y &= 11 \\
--     \hline
--     2x &= 36
--   \end{align*}
-- \\]
-- This gives us \\(2x = 36\\), which implies \\(x = 18\\).
linarith

-- The `linarith` tactic is powerful for solving linear arithmetic goals. It can detect that
-- we have a system of linear equations and solve for \\(x\\) automatically.
-- It's adding the two equations, deriving \\(2x = 36\\), and then dividing by 2 to get \\(x = 18\\).
-- Since this is a straightforward system of linear equations, `linarith` can handle it directly.

-- Therefore, the larger of the two numbers is indeed 18.
-- The sum of two numbers is 25 and their difference is 11. What is the larger of the two numbers? Show that it is 18.-/
