-- The sum of two numbers is 25
-- The difference of two numbers is 11
-- What is the larger of the two numbers?
-- Show that it is 18.

-- The two equations areh₀: x + y = 25 and h₁: x - y = 11
-- We can add these two equations to get: 2x = 36
have hsum : 2 * x = 36 := by
  linarith [h₀, h₁]

-- Thus, we have x = 18
