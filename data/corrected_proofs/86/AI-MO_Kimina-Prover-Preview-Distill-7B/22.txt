-- The sum of two numbers is 25
-- The difference of two numbers is 11
-- what is the larger of the two numbers?
-- show that it is 18

-- We consider two equations
-- x + y = 25
-- x - y = 11
-- Add the two equations, we get
have h2 : 2 * x = 36 := by
  linarith

-- Solve the equation, we get
-- x = 18
