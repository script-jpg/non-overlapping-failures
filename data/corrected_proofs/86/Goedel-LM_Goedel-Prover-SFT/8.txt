Given the sum of two numbers \( x \) and \( y \) is 25, and their difference is 11, we need to find the larger of the two numbers, which is 18. We start by expressing \( x \) in terms of \( y \) using the given equations. Adding the two equations, we get \( 2x = 36 \), which simplifies to \( x = 18 \). This value of \( x \) is then verified to satisfy the original equations.

-- We need to show that x = 18.
have h₂ : x = 18 := by
  -- Adding the two given equations to eliminate y:
  -- (x + y) + (x - y) = 25 + 11
  have h₃ : 2 * x = 36 := by linarith
  -- Dividing by 2 to solve for x:

-- The result h₂ shows that x = 18, which is what we needed to prove.
