Given two real numbers \( x \) and \( y \), we know that their sum is 25 and their difference is 11. We need to show that the larger of these two numbers is 18.
First, we add the two given equations:
\[ (x + y) + (x - y) = 25 + 11 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 2x = 36 \]
Solving for \( x \), we get:
\[ x = 18 \]

-- We start by adding the two given equations to eliminate y.

  -- Adding the two equations: (x + y) + (x - y) = 25 + 11

-- Now we solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 2.
