Given two real numbers \( x \) and \( y \) such that their sum is 25 and their difference is 11, we need to show that the larger of the two numbers is 18. We start by adding the two given equations to eliminate \( y \). This gives us \( 2x = 36 \), which simplifies to \( x = 18 \). We then verify that \( y \) can be determined by substituting \( x = 18 \) back into one of the original equations.

-- Adding the two given equations to eliminate y:
have h₂ : 2 * x = 36 := by
  -- Adding the equations h₀ and h₁:
  linarith
-- Dividing by 2 to solve for x:
have h₃ : x = 18 := by
  -- Dividing both sides of h₂ by 2:
  linarith
-- The final result:
exact h₃
