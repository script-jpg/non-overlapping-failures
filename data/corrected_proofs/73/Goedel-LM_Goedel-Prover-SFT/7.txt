To convert the number \(852_9\) to base 10 and show that it equals 695, we start by expressing \(852_9\) in its expanded form:
\[ 8 \cdot 9^2 + 5 \cdot 9 + 2 \]
First, we calculate the powers and products:
\[ 9^2 = 81 \]
\[ 8 \cdot 81 = 648 \]
\[ 5 \cdot 9 = 45 \]
Next, we sum these values:
\[ 648 + 45 + 2 = 695 \]
Thus, we have shown that \(852_9\) equals 695 in base 10.
