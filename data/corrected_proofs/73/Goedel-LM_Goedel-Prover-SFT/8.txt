To convert the number \(852_9\) to base 10, we use the formula for base conversion. The number \(852_9\) can be expressed as:
\[ 8 \cdot 9^2 + 5 \cdot 9 + 2 \]
Calculating each term individually:
\[ 8 \cdot 9^2 = 8 \cdot 81 = 648 \]
\[ 5 \cdot 9 = 45 \]
Adding these results together with the constant term:
\[ 648 + 45 + 2 = 695 \]
Thus, the base-10 equivalent of \(852_9\) is 695.
