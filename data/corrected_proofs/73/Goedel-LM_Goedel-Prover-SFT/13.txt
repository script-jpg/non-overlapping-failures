To convert the number \(852_9\) to base 10, we need to evaluate the expression \(8 \cdot 9^2 + 5 \cdot 9 + 2\). We start by calculating each term separately:
1. \(8 \cdot 9^2 = 8 \cdot 81 = 648\)
2. \(5 \cdot 9 = 45\)
3. \(2\)
Adding these results together:
\[648 + 45 + 2 = 695\]
Thus, the base 10 equivalent of \(852_9\) is 695.
