Given that the father's age is five times the son's age today, and exactly three years ago, the sum of their ages was 30, we need to determine the son's current age. Let \( x \) be the son's age today and \( y \) be the father's age today. We are given the following equations:
1. \( y = 5x \)
2. \( (x - 3) + (y - 3) = 30 \)
First, substitute \( y = 5x \) into the second equation:
\[ (x - 3) + (5x - 3) = 30 \]
Simplify the equation:
\[ x - 3 + 5x - 3 = 30 \]
\[ 6x - 6 = 30 \]
Add 6 to both sides:
\[ 6x = 36 \]
Divide by 6:
\[ x = 6 \]
Thus, the son's current age is \( 6 \).
