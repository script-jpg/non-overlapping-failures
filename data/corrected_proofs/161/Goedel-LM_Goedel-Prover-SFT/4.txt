Given the conditions:
1. The father's age \( y \) is five times the son's age \( x \).
2. Exactly three years ago, the sum of their ages was 30.
We need to determine the son's current age \( x \).
From the first condition, we have \( y = 5x \).
From the second condition, we know that the sum of their ages three years ago was 30. Therefore, the equation representing the sum of their ages three years ago is:
\[ x - 3 + (y - 3) = 30 \]
Substituting \( y = 5x \) into the equation:
\[ x - 3 + (5x - 3) = 30 \]
Simplifying the equation:
\[ x - 3 + 5x - 3 = 30 \]
\[ 6x - 6 = 30 \]
\[ 6x = 36 \]
\[ x = 6 \]
Thus, the son's current age is \( x = 6 \).
