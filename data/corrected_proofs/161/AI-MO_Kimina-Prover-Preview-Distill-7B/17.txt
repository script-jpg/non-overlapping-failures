-- ages are positive
have hx := h₀.1
have hy := h₀.2

-- exactly three years ago, the sum of their ages was 30
have hsum : ↑x - (3 : ℤ) + (y - (3 : ℤ)) = 30 := h₂

-- go back to the age when they add up to 30
have hxy : 5 * x = y := h₁

-- the son is 6 years old
have h6 : x = 6 := by
  omega

-- conclusion
exact h6
