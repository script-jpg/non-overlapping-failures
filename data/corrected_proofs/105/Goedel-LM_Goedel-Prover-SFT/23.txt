Given that the mean score of the morning class is 84 and the mean score of the afternoon class is 70, and the ratio of the number of students in the morning class to the number of students in the afternoon class is \( \frac{3}{4} \), we need to find the mean score of all students.
Let \( m \) be the number of students in the morning class and \( a \) be the number of students in the afternoon class. We are given:
\[ \frac{m}{a} = \frac{3}{4} \]
This implies:
\[ 4m = 3a \]
The total mean score of all students is:
\[ \frac{84m + 70a}{m + a} \]
To find this mean, we can use the fact that \( 4m = 3a \) to simplify the expression. Substituting \( a = \frac{4m}{3} \) into the total mean score formula:
\[ \frac{84m + 70 \left( \frac{4m}{3} \right)}{m + \frac{4m}{3}} \]
Simplifying the numerator:
\[ 84m + 70 \left( \frac{4m}{3} \right) = 84m + \frac{280m}{3} = \frac{252m + 280m}{3} = \frac{532m}{3} \]
Simplifying the denominator:
\[ m + \frac{4m}{3} = \frac{3m + 4m}{3} = \frac{7m}{3} \]
Thus, the total mean score is:
\[ \frac{\frac{532m}{3}}{\frac{7m}{3}} = \frac{532m}{3} \cdot \frac{3}{7m} = \frac{532}{7} = 76 \]
Therefore, the mean score of all students is \( 76 \).
