Given the mean scores of students in the morning and afternoon classes, and the ratio of the number of students in these classes, we need to find the mean score of all students. The mean score of the morning class is 84, and the mean score of the afternoon class is 70. The ratio of the number of students in the morning class to the number of students in the afternoon class is \(\frac{3}{4}\).
To find the mean score of all students, we calculate the total score of all students and then divide by the total number of students. The total score of the morning class is \(84 \times \text{number of morning students}\), and the total score of the afternoon class is \(70 \times \text{number of afternoon students}\). The total number of students is the sum of the number of morning students and afternoon students.
Given the ratio \(\frac{m}{a} = \frac{3}{4}\), we can express the number of morning students in terms of the number of afternoon students. Let \(x\) be the number of afternoon students. Then, the number of morning students is \(\frac{3}{4}x\).
Substituting this into the mean formula, we get:
\[
\text{Mean score of all students} = \frac{84 \times \frac{3}{4}x + 70x}{\frac{3}{4}x + x}
\]
Simplifying the numerator:
\[
84 \times \frac{3}{4}x + 70x = 63x + 70x = 133x
\]
Simplifying the denominator:
\[
\frac{3}{4}x + x = \frac{3}{4}x + \frac{4}{4}x = \frac{7}{4}x
\]
Thus, the mean score of all students is:
\[
\frac{133x}{\frac{7}{4}x} = \frac{133x \times 4}{7x} = \frac{532}{7} = 76
\]
