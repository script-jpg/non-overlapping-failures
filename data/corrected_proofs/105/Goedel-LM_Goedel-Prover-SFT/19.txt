Given that the mean score of the morning class is 84 and the mean score of the afternoon class is 70, and the ratio of the number of students in the morning class to the number of students in the afternoon class is \(\frac{3}{4}\), we need to find the mean score of all students.
Let \( m \) be the number of students in the morning class and \( a \) be the number of students in the afternoon class. We are given the following conditions:
1. \(\frac{m}{a} = \frac{3}{4}\)
2. The mean score of the morning class is 84.
3. The mean score of the afternoon class is 70.
From the ratio condition, we can express \( m \) in terms of \( a \):
\[ m = \frac{3}{4} a \]
The total number of students is \( m + a \). The total score of all students is:
\[ 84m + 70a \]
Substituting \( m = \frac{3}{4} a \) into the total score equation:
\[ 84 \left( \frac{3}{4} a \right) + 70a = 63a + 70a = 133a \]
The mean score of all students is:
\[ \frac{133a}{m + a} = \frac{133a}{\frac{3}{4} a + a} = \frac{133a}{\frac{7}{4} a} = \frac{133a \cdot 4}{7a} = \frac{532a}{7a} = 76 \]
Thus, the mean score of all students is 76.
