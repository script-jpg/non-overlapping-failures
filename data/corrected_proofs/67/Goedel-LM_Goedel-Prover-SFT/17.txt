To determine the point where the lines \( s = 9 - 2t \) and \( t = 3s + 1 \) intersect, we need to solve the system of equations:
1. \( s = 9 - 2t \)
2. \( t = 3s + 1 \)
First, substitute \( t = 3s + 1 \) into the first equation:
\[ s = 9 - 2(3s + 1) \]
Simplify the equation:
\[ s = 9 - 6s - 2 \]
\[ s = 7 - 6s \]
Add \( 6s \) to both sides:
\[ 7s = 7 \]
Divide by 7:
\[ s = 1 \]
Now, substitute \( s = 1 \) back into the second equation:
\[ 1 = 3(1) + 1 \]
\[ 1 = 3 + 1 \]
\[ 1 = 4 \]
Thus, the point of intersection is \( (1, 4) \).
