To find the point where the lines \( s = 9 - 2t \) and \( t = 3s + 1 \) intersect, we need to solve the system of equations:
1. \( s = 9 - 2t \)
2. \( t = 3s + 1 \)
First, substitute \( t = 3s + 1 \) into the first equation:
\[ s = 9 - 2(3s + 1) \]
\[ s = 9 - 6s - 2 \]
\[ s + 6s = 7 \]
\[ 7s = 7 \]
\[ s = 1 \]
Next, substitute \( s = 1 \) back into the second equation:
\[ t = 3(1) + 1 \]
\[ t = 4 \]
Thus, the point of intersection is \( (1, 4) \).

have h : s = 1 := by
  linarith [h₀, h₁]
-- Substitute s = 1 back into the second equation:
-- t = 3(1) + 1
-- t = 4
have h₂ : t = 4 := by
  linarith [h₀, h₁, h]
-- Combine the results to get the final answer.
