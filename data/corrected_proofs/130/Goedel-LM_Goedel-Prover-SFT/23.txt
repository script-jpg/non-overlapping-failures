Given two real numbers \(a\) and \(b\) such that \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\), we need to show that \(ab + (a - b) \leq 1\).
1. Consider the expression \(a^2 + b^2\). Since \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\), we can use this equality to bound the terms in the inequality.
2. We need to show that \(ab + (a - b) \leq 1\). To do this, we can use the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative.
3. Consider the expression \((a - b)^2\). Since the square of any real number is non-negative, \((a - b)^2 \geq 0\).
4. Expanding \((a - b)^2\) gives \(a^2 - 2ab + b^2\). Since \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\), we substitute to get \(1 - 2ab \geq 0\), which simplifies to \(2ab \leq 1\).
5. Now, consider the expression \(ab + (a - b)\). We can use the fact that \(ab + (a - b) \leq 1\) by leveraging the non-negativity of squares and the given equality.
6. Specifically, we use the fact that \((a + b)^2 \geq 0\) and \((a - b)^2 \geq 0\) to bound the terms in the inequality.
