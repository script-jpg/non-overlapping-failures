-- The problem asks for the ones digit of the product $1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 9 \cdot 11 \cdot 13$.
-- To find the ones digit, we need to calculate the remainder when this product is divided by 10.
-- Notice that the product includes the number 5 and the number 11, which is also a multiple of 5.
-- In fact, the product includes multiple multiples of 5, which means the entire product is a multiple of 5.
-- However, to determine the ones digit, we need to calculate the product modulo 10.
-- We can simplify the calculation by noting that the presence of both 5 and an even number (like 16 in the original problem) would make the product a multiple of 10.
-- Since we have 5 and 15 (which is also a multiple of 5), we need to compute the product modulo 10 directly.
