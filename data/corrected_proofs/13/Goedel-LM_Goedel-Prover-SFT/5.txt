To determine the ones digit of the product \(1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 9 \cdot 11 \cdot 13\), we need to compute the product modulo 10. We observe that the ones digit of each number in the product is 3. Therefore, we can simplify the problem by considering the ones digit of each number and then multiplying these ones digits. The ones digit of 3 is 3, and the product of 3 with itself is 9. The ones digit of 9 is 9. The product of 9 with any other ones digit (3 or 5) will result in a number with an ones digit of 5. Thus, the ones digit of the entire product is 5.
