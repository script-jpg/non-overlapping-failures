To determine the ones digit of the product \(1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 9 \cdot 11 \cdot 13\), we need to compute the product modulo 10. We observe that each number in the product is odd, and thus ends in 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. We can simplify the problem by noting that the product of these numbers will be a multiple of 10 if we consider the last digits of each number. The last digit of the product of these numbers will be 5 because the product of the last digits of these numbers is \(1 \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 9 \cdot 11 \cdot 13\), which simplifies to 5 modulo 10.
