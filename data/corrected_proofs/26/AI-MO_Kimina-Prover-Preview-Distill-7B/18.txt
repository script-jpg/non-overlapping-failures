-- Solving the System of Equations

  -- From h₀: 3a = b + c + d
  -- From h₁: 4b = a + c + d
  -- From h₂: 2c = a + b + d

  -- Subtracting h₀ from h₁: 4b - 3a = (a + c + d) - (b + c + d) = a - b
  -- So 4b - 3a = a - b
  -- 5b = 4a
  -- b = 4/5 a

  -- Subtracting h₁ from h₂: 2c - 4b = (a + b + d) - (a + c + d)
  -- 2c - 4b = b - c
  -- 3c = 5b
  -- c = 5/3 b

  -- Substituting b = 4/5 a: c = 5/3 * 4/5 a = 4/3 a

  -- From h₃: 8a + 10b + 6c = 24
  -- Substituting b = 4/5 a and c = 4/3 a:
  -- 8a + 10 * 4/5 a + 6 * 4/3 a = 24
  -- 8a + 8a + 8a = 24
  -- 24a = 24
  -- a = 1

  -- Then b = 4/5, c = 4/3

  -- Substituting into h₀: 3 * 1 = 4/5 + 4/3 + d
  -- 3 = 4/5 + 4/3 + d
  -- 3 = 12/15 + 20/15 + d
  -- 3 = 32/15 + d
  -- d = 3 - 32/15 = 45/15 - 32/15 = 13/15

  -- The fraction 13/15 is already in simplest form, so the sum of the numerator and denominator is 13 + 15 = 28.
