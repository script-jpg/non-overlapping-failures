-- We need to find the digit $n$ such that $20n7$ is divisible by $11$.

-- The divisibility rule for $11$ says that a number is divisible by $11$ if and only if the alternating sum of its digits is divisible by $11$.
-- For $20n7$, the alternating sum is $2 - 0 + n - 7 = n - 5$.
-- So $20n7$ is divisible by $11$ if and only if $n - 5$ is divisible by $11$.

-- Since $0 \leq n \leq 9$, the only value that makes $n - 5$ divisible by $11$ is $n = 5$.
