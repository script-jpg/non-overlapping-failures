To determine the digit that must be placed in the blank to make the four-digit integer \(20\_7\) a multiple of 11, we need to find the digit \(n\) such that \(2000 + 100n + 7\) is divisible by 11. We can simplify the problem by noting that \(2000 \equiv 5 \pmod{11}\). Therefore, the expression \(2000 + 100n + 7 \equiv 5 + 100n + 7 \pmod{11}\). Simplifying further, we get \(12 + 100n \equiv 0 \pmod{11}\). This implies \(100n \equiv -12 \pmod{11}\), or equivalently, \(100n \equiv 9 \pmod{11}\). Since \(100 \equiv 1 \pmod{11}\), we have \(n \equiv 9 \pmod{11}\). The only digit \(n\) that satisfies this condition is \(n = 5\), as \(9 \equiv 5 \pmod{11}\).
