To determine the digit \( n \) that must be placed in the blank to make the four-digit integer \( 20_n \) a multiple of 11, we need to show that \( n = 5 \). The condition for \( 20_n \) to be a multiple of 11 is that the alternating sum of its digits must be divisible by 11. For \( 20_n \), this means \( 2 - 0 + n - 7 \) must be divisible by 11. Simplifying this, we get \( n - 5 \). Setting this equal to a multiple of 11 and solving for \( n \), we find that \( n = 5 \).

-- We know that the alternating sum of the digits must be divisible by 11
-- The alternating sum for 20_n is 2 - 0 + n - 7
-- Simplifying this, we get n - 5
-- We need to find n such that n - 5 is a multiple of 11
have : n = 5 := by
  -- Solve the equation n - 5 = 0 using the omega tactic

-- Simplify all assumptions and conclude that n = 5
