To determine the digit that must be placed in the blank to make the four-digit integer \(20\_7\) a multiple of 11, we need to show that this digit is 5. Given that \(20\_7\) is a multiple of 11, we can express this as \(20 \times 100 + 10 \times n + 7 \equiv 0 \pmod{11}\). Simplifying this congruence, we find that \(n \equiv 5 \pmod{11}\). Since \(n\) is a single digit, the only solution is \(n = 5\).
