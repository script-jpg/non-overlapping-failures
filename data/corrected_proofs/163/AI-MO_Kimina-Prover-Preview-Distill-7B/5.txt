-- Given $f(x)=cx^3-9x+3$ and $f(2)=9$, find the value of $c$. Show that it is 3.

-- The h₀'s sake is to tell us that $f$ is defined as $cx^3-9x+3$.
have h₂ : f 2 = c * 2 ^ 3 - 9 * 2 + 3 := h₀ 2

-- We substitute x=2 into $f(x)=cx^3-9x+3$ to get $f(2)=c\cdot2^3-9\cdot2+3$.

-- Now we calculate $c\cdot2^3-9\cdot2+3=9$.

-- Solving the equation $c * 8 - 18 + 3 = 9$, we get $c = 3$.
