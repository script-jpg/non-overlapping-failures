-- Given $f(x)=cx^3-9x+3$ and $f(2)=9$, find the value of $c$. Show that it is 3.

  -- -- The problem asks us to find the value of $c$ given $f(x) = cx^3 - 9x + 3$ and $f(2) = 9$.
  -- We can find $c$ by substituting $x = 2$ into $f$ and setting it equal to $9$.
  have h₂ : f 2 = c * 2 ^ 3 - 9 * 2 + 3 := h₀ 2
  -- Now, we have $f(2) = c \cdot 2^3 - 9 \cdot 2 + 3$ from the definition of $f$.
  -- We also know $f(2) = 9$ from the given condition $h₁$.
  rw [h₂] at h₁
  -- After substituting, we get $9 = c \cdot 8 - 18 + 3$.
  -- This simplifies to $9 = 8c - 15$.
  -- Solving for $c$, we get $8c = 24$.
  -- Therefore, $c = 3$.
