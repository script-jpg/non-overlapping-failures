/-Given the function \( f(x) = cx^3 - 9x + 3 \) and the condition \( f(2) = 9 \), we need to find the value of \( c \). By substituting \( x = 2 \) into the function, we get:
\[ f(2) = c \cdot 2^3 - 9 \cdot 2 + 3 = 9 \]
Simplifying the expression:
\[ 2^3 = 8 \]
Thus, the equation becomes:
\[ c \cdot 8 - 18 + 3 = 9 \]
Combining like terms:
\[ 8c - 15 = 9 \]
Adding 15 to both sides:
\[ 8c = 24 \]
Dividing both sides by 8:
\[ c = 3 \]
