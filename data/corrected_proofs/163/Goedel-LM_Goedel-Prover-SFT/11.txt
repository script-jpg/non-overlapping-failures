Given the function \( f(x) = cx^3 - 9x + 3 \) and the condition \( f(2) = 9 \), we need to find the value of \( c \). We start by substituting \( x = 2 \) into the function to get the equation \( c \cdot 2^3 - 9 \cdot 2 + 3 = 9 \). Simplifying this equation, we find that \( 8c - 18 + 3 = 9 \). Combining like terms, we get \( 8c - 15 = 9 \). Adding 15 to both sides, we obtain \( 8c = 24 \). Finally, dividing both sides by 8, we find that \( c = 3 \).
