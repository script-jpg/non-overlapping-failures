To determine the remainder of 1529 when divided by 6, we can use the property of modular arithmetic. Specifically, we need to find \( 1529 \mod 6 \). By performing the division, we can see that:
\[ 1529 \div 6 = 254 \text{ remainder } 5 \]
This is because:
\[ 1529 = 6 \times 254 + 5 \]
Thus, the remainder when 1529 is divided by 6 is 5.
