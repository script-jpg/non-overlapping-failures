-- Find 24^{-1} \pmod{11^2}. That is, find the residue b for which 24b \equiv 1\pmod{11^2}.
-- Express your answer as an integer from 0 to 11^2-1, inclusive. Show that it is 116.

-- The modular inverse of a (mod m) is an integer x such that a * x ≡ 1 (mod m).
-- This is equivalent to solving the congruence a * x ≡ 1 (mod m), which means finding x such that a * x - m * k = 1 for some integer k.
-- This is a Diophantine equation, and it has a solution if and only if gcd(a, m) = 1.
-- To solve this, we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm, which finds integers x and y such that a * x + m * y = gcd(a, m).
-- If gcd(a, m) = 1, then x is the modular inverse of a (mod m).

-- First, let's compute the gcd of 24 and 121 (11^2)
-- 121 = 24 * 5 + 1 (since 24 * 5 = 120 and 121 - 120 = 1)
-- 24 = 1 * 24 + 0
-- So gcd(24, 121) = 1, which means 24 has an inverse modulo 121.

-- Now, let's find the coefficient x in the equation 24 * x + 121 * y = 1
-- From the Euclidean algorithm steps:
-- 1 = 121 - 24 * 5
-- So x = -5 and y = 1 is a particular solution.
-- The general solution is x = -5 + 121 * k and y = 1 - 24 * k for any integer k.

-- We want the multiplicative inverse to be a positive integer between 0 and 120 (inclusive).
-- So we need to find k such that -5 + 121 * k ≥ 0 and -5 + 121 * k ≤ 120
-- Solving for k in -5 + 121 * k ≥ 0: k ≥ 5/121, so k ≥ 1 (since k must be an integer)
-- Solving for k in -5 + 121 * k ≤ 120: k ≤ 125/121, so k ≤ 1 (since k must be an integer)
-- Therefore, k = 1 is the only solution, which gives x = -5 + 121 * 1 = 116.

-- Thus, 24^{-1} ≡ 116 (mod 121)

-- Now, let's translate this into Lean 4 code:
