To solve the problem of finding the largest negative integer \( x \) that satisfies the congruence \( 24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199} \), we start by analyzing the given congruence. We need to find the largest negative integer \( x \) that satisfies this congruence.
First, we rewrite the congruence:
\[ 24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199} \]
This means:
\[ 24x - 15 = 1199k \text{ for some integer } k \]
We can simplify this to:
\[ 24x = 15 + 1199k \]
To find the largest negative \( x \), we need to solve for \( k \) such that \( 24x \) is negative and as large as possible. We test values of \( k \) to find the largest \( x \) that satisfies the conditions.
Testing values:
- For \( k = 0 \):
  \[ 24x = 15 \]
  \[ x = \frac{15}{24} = \frac{5}{8} \]
  This does not yield an integer.
- For \( k = 1 \):
  \[ 24x = 15 + 1199 \]
  \[ 24x = 1214 \]
  \[ x = \frac{1214}{24} = \frac{607}{12} \]
  This does not yield an integer.
- For \( k = -1 \):
  \[ 24x = 15 - 1199 \]
  \[ 24x = -1184 \]
  \[ x = \frac{-1184}{24} = \frac{-592}{12} \]
  This does not yield an integer.
- For \( k = -2 \):
  \[ 24x = 15 + 2398 \]
  \[ 24x = 2413 \]
  \[ x = \frac{2413}{24} = 100.541667 \]
  This does not yield an integer.
- For \( k = -3 \):
  \[ 24x = 15 - 3597 \]
  \[ 24x = -3582 \]
  \[ x = \frac{-3582}{24} = -149.25 \]
  This does not yield an integer.
- For \( k = -4 \):
  \[ 24x = 15 + 4796 \]
  \[ 24x = 4811 \]
  \[ x = \frac{4811}{24} = 200.458333 \]
  This does not yield an integer.
- For \( k = -5 \):
  \[ 24x = 15 - 5995 \]
  \[ 24x = -5980 \]
  \[ x = \frac{-5980}{24} = -249.1667 \]
  This does not yield an integer.
- For \( k = -6 \):
  \[ 24x = 15 + 7191 \]
  \[ 24x = 7206 \]
  \[ x = \frac{7206}{24} = 300.25 \]
  This does not yield an integer.
- For \( k = -7 \):
  \[ 24x = 15 - 8995 \]
  \[ 24x = -8980 \]
  \[ x = \frac{-8980}{24} = -374.1667 \]
  This does not yield an integer.
- For \( k = -8 \):
  \[ 24x = 15 + 10191 \]
  \[ 24x = 10206 \]
  \[ x = \frac{10206}{24} = 433.583333 \]
  This does not yield an integer.
- For \( k = -9 \):
  \[ 24x = 15 - 11991 \]
  \[ 24x = -11976 \]
  \[ x = \frac{-11976}{24} = -490.75 \]
  This does not yield an integer.
- For \( k = -10 \):
  \[ 24x = 15 + 13191 \]
  \[ 24x = 13206 \]
  \[ x = \frac{13206}{24} = 550.25 \]
  This does not yield an integer.
- For \( k = -11 \):
  \[ 24x = 15 - 14991 \]
  \[ 24x = -14976 \]
  \[ x = \frac{-14976}{24} = -623.999999 \]
  This does not yield an integer.
- For \( k = -12 \):
  \[ 24x = 15 + 16191 \]
  \[ 24x = 16206 \]
  \[ x = \frac{16206}{24} = 675.25 \]
  This does not yield an integer.
- For \( k = -13 \):
  \[ 24x = 15 - 17991 \]
  \[ 24x = -17976 \]
  \[ x = \frac{-17976}{24} = -749 \]
  This yields an integer.
Thus, the largest negative integer \( x \) that satisfies the congruence is \( -449 \).
