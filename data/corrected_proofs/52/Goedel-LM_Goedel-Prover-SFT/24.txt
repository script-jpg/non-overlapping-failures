To solve the problem of finding the largest negative integer \( x \) that satisfies the congruence \( 24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199} \), we start by analyzing the given congruence. We need to find \( x \) such that \( 24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199} \). This can be rewritten as:
\[ 24x = 1199k + 15 \]
for some integer \( k \). We can simplify this equation by isolating \( x \):
\[ 24x - 1199k = 15 \]
\[ x = \frac{1199k + 15}{24} \]
To ensure \( x \) is an integer, \( 1199k + 15 \) must be divisible by 24. We can test values of \( k \) to find the largest \( x \) that satisfies this condition.
