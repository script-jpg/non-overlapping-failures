To show that the largest negative integer \( x \) satisfying \( 24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199} \) is \(-449\), we proceed as follows:
1. Given \( 24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199} \), we need to find the largest negative \( x \) that satisfies this congruence.
2. We start by simplifying the congruence using properties of modular arithmetic.
3. We use the fact that \( 24 \) and \( 1199 \) are coprime to find a modular inverse of \( 24 \) modulo \( 1199 \).
4. We solve for \( x \) using the properties of modular arithmetic and the given congruence.
5. We verify that the solution \( x = -449 \) satisfies the original congruence and is negative.
6. We confirm that \( x = -449 \) is the largest such negative integer.
