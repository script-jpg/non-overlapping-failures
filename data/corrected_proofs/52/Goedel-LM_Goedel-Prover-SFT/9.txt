To find the largest negative integer \( x \) satisfying \( 24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199} \), we need to find the integer \( x \) that satisfies the congruence equation. We will show that \( x = -449 \) is the largest such integer.
1. Start by expressing the congruence condition: \( 24x \equiv 15 \pmod{1199} \).
2. Use the property of modular arithmetic to rewrite this condition: \( 24x - 15 = 1199k \) for some integer \( k \).
3. Solve for \( x \) in terms of \( k \): \( 24x = 15 + 1199k \).
4. Divide both sides by 24 to isolate \( x \): \( x = \frac{15 + 1199k}{24} \).
5. For \( x \) to be an integer, \( 15 + 1199k \) must be divisible by 24.
6. Check the values of \( k \) that make \( 15 + 1199k \) divisible by 24.
7. Find the largest negative \( k \) that satisfies the condition.
8. Verify that \( x = -449 \) is the largest negative integer satisfying the congruence.
