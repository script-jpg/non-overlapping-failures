Given that a snack-size tin of peaches contains 40 calories and represents 2% of a person's daily caloric requirement, we need to determine the total calories in a person's daily caloric requirement. We start by setting up the equation \( \frac{x}{50} = 40 \), where \( x \) represents the total calories in a person's daily caloric requirement. Solving for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 50 to isolate \( x \). This gives us \( x = 40 \times 50 \). Performing the multiplication, we find that \( x = 2000 \).
