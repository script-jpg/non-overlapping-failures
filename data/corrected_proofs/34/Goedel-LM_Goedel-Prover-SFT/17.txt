Given that a snack-size tin of peaches has 40 calories and this amount represents 2% of a person's daily caloric requirement, we need to determine the total daily caloric requirement. We start with the equation \( \frac{x}{50} = 40 \), where \( x \) represents the total daily caloric requirement. To solve for \( x \), we first clear the fraction by multiplying both sides by 50. This gives us \( x = 40 \times 50 \). Simplifying the right-hand side, we find \( x = 2000 \).

-- We start with the given equation x / 50 = 40.
have h₁ : x = 40 * 50 := by
  -- To solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by 50.

  -- This step involves rewriting the equation to isolate x on one side.

-- Now we have x = 40 * 50, which simplifies to x = 2000.
