Given that a snack-size tin of peaches has 40 calories and is 2% of a person's daily caloric requirement, we need to determine the daily caloric requirement of a person. We are given the equation \( \frac{x}{50} = 40 \), where \( x \) represents the daily caloric requirement. To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 50 to isolate \( x \). This gives us \( x = 40 \times 50 \), which simplifies to \( x = 2000 \).

-- We start with the given equation x / 50 = 40
have h₁ : x = 40 * 50 := by
  -- Multiply both sides by 50 to isolate x on one side of the equation
