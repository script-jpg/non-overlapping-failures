Given that a snack-size tin of peaches has 40 calories and this amount is 2% of a person's daily caloric requirement, we need to determine the person's daily caloric requirement. We start by setting up the equation based on the given percentage:
\[
\frac{x}{50} = 40
\]
To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 50:
\[
x = 40 \times 50
\]
Simplifying the right-hand side, we find:
\[
x = 2000
\]
Thus, the person's daily caloric requirement is 2000 calories.
