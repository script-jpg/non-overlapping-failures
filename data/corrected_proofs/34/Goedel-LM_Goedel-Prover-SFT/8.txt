Given that a snack-size tin of peaches has 40 calories and this amount represents 2% of a person's daily caloric requirement, we need to determine the total daily caloric requirement. We start with the equation \( \frac{x}{50} = 40 \). To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by 50 to isolate \( x \). This gives us \( x = 40 \times 50 \). Simplifying the right-hand side, we find \( x = 2000 \).

-- To solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation x / 50 = 40 by 50.
