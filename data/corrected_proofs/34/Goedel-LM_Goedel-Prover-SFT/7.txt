Given that a snack-size tin of peaches has 40 calories and is 2% of a person's daily caloric requirement, we need to determine how many calories fulfill a person's daily caloric requirement. We start by setting up the equation based on the given information:
\[ \frac{x}{50} = 40 \]
To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 50:
\[ x = 40 \times 50 \]
Simplifying the right-hand side, we find:
\[ x = 2000 \]
Thus, the number of calories that fulfill a person's daily caloric requirement is 2000.
