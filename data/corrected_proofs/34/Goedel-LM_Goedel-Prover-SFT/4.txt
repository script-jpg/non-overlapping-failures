Given that a snack-size tin of peaches has 40 calories and this amount is 2% of a person's daily caloric requirement, we need to determine the total calories in a person's daily caloric requirement. We are given the equation \( \frac{x}{50} = 40 \). To solve for \( x \), we first clear the fraction by multiplying both sides by 50, resulting in \( x = 40 \times 50 \). Simplifying this, we find \( x = 2000 \).

-- To solve for x, we first clear the fraction by multiplying both sides by 50.
have h₁ : x = 40 * 50 := by
  -- Multiply both sides of the equation x / 50 = 40 by 50 to isolate x.

-- Now, we simplify the equation x = 40 * 50 to find the value of x.
