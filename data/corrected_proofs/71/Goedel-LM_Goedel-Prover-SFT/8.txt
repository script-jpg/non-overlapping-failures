Given an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = \frac{2}{3} \) and the ninth term \( a_9 = \frac{4}{5} \), we need to find the fifth term \( a_5 \).
First, we express the difference between the first and second terms:
\[ a_2 - a_1 = a_1 - a_0 \]
Next, we express the difference between the second and third terms:
\[ a_3 - a_2 = a_2 - a_1 \]
Continuing this pattern, we find the differences between the third and fourth terms:
\[ a_4 - a_3 = a_3 - a_2 \]
\[ a_5 - a_4 = a_4 - a_3 \]
\[ a_6 - a_5 = a_5 - a_4 \]
\[ a_7 - a_6 = a_6 - a_5 \]
\[ a_8 - a_7 = a_7 - a_6 \]
\[ a_9 - a_8 = a_8 - a_7 \]
Given the differences are constant, we can use the relationship between the first and ninth terms to find the fifth term:
\[ a_9 = a_1 + 8(a_2 - a_1) \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ \frac{4}{5} = \frac{2}{3} + 8(a_2 - a_1) \]
Solving for \( a_2 - a_1 \):
\[ \frac{4}{5} - \frac{2}{3} = 8(a_2 - a_1) \]
\[ \frac{12}{15} - \frac{10}{15} = 8(a_2 - a_1) \]
\[ \frac{2}{15} = 8(a_2 - a_1) \]
\[ a_2 - a_1 = \frac{2}{120} = \frac{1}{60} \]
Now, we find the fifth term:
\[ a_5 = a_1 + 4(a_2 - a_1) \]
\[ a_5 = \frac{2}{3} + 4 \cdot \frac{1}{60} \]
\[ a_5 = \frac{2}{3} + \frac{4}{60} \]
\[ a_5 = \frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{15} \]
\[ a_5 = \frac{10}{15} + \frac{1}{15} \]
\[ a_5 = \frac{11}{15} \]
Thus, the fifth term is \( \frac{11}{15} \).
