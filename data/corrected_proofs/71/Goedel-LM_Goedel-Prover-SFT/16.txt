Given an arithmetic sequence \( a \) where the first term \( a_1 = \frac{2}{3} \) and the ninth term \( a_9 = \frac{4}{5} \), we need to determine the fifth term \( a_5 \). The common difference \( d \) of the arithmetic sequence can be expressed as \( d = a_{n+1} - a_n \). Using the given terms, we can set up the equation for the ninth term:
\[ a_9 = a_1 + 8d \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ \frac{4}{5} = \frac{2}{3} + 8d \]
Solving for \( d \):
\[ 8d = \frac{4}{5} - \frac{2}{3} \]
\[ 8d = \frac{12 - 10}{15} \]
\[ 8d = \frac{2}{15} \]
\[ d = \frac{1}{15} \]
Now, we can find the fifth term \( a_5 \):
\[ a_5 = a_1 + 4d \]
\[ a_5 = \frac{2}{3} + 4 \cdot \frac{1}{15} \]
\[ a_5 = \frac{2}{3} + \frac{4}{15} \]
\[ a_5 = \frac{10}{15} + \frac{4}{15} \]
\[ a_5 = \frac{14}{15} \]
Thus, the fifth term \( a_5 \) is \( \frac{11}{15} \).
