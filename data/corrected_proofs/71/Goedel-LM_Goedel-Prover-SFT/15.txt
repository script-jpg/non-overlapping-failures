Given an arithmetic sequence with the first term \( \frac{2}{3} \) and the ninth term \( \frac{4}{5} \), we need to find the fifth term. The common difference \( d \) of the arithmetic sequence can be determined by the difference between any two consecutive terms. Using the given terms, we can set up the equation for the fifth term and solve for it.
