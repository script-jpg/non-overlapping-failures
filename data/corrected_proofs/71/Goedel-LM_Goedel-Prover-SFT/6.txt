Given an arithmetic sequence where the first term is \(\frac{2}{3}\) and the ninth term is \(\frac{4}{5}\), we need to find the fifth term. Let \(d\) be the common difference of the arithmetic sequence. The relationship between the terms can be expressed as:
\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \]
Given \(a_1 = \frac{2}{3}\) and \(a_9 = \frac{4}{5}\), we can write:
\[ a_9 = a_1 + 8d \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ \frac{4}{5} = \frac{2}{3} + 8d \]
Solving for \(d\):
\[ \frac{4}{5} - \frac{2}{3} = 8d \]
\[ \frac{12}{15} - \frac{10}{15} = 8d \]
\[ \frac{2}{15} = 8d \]
\[ d = \frac{2}{15 \cdot 8} = \frac{2}{120} = \frac{1}{60} \]
Now, we need to find the fifth term \(a_5\):
\[ a_5 = a_1 + 4d \]
\[ a_5 = \frac{2}{3} + 4 \cdot \frac{1}{60} \]
\[ a_5 = \frac{2}{3} + \frac{4}{60} \]
\[ a_5 = \frac{2}{3} + \frac{1}{15} \]
\[ a_5 = \frac{10}{15} + \frac{1}{15} \]
\[ a_5 = \frac{11}{15} \]
Thus, the fifth term is \(\frac{11}{15}\).
