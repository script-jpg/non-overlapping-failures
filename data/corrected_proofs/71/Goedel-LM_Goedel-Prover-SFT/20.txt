Given an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \) and the ninth term \( a_9 \) is \( \frac{4}{5} \), we need to find the fifth term \( a_5 \). The common difference \( d \) of the arithmetic sequence can be derived from the difference between any two consecutive terms. Using the given terms, we can set up the equation for the ninth term in terms of the first term and the common difference. Solving for \( d \) and then using it to find \( a_5 \) will yield the required result.
