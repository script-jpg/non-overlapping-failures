To solve the equation \(\frac{x-9}{x+1} = 2\) for \(x\), we start by ensuring that the denominator is not zero. Given \(x \neq -1\), we can safely manipulate the equation. Multiplying both sides by \(x+1\) to clear the fraction, we get:
\[ x - 9 = 2(x + 1) \]
Expanding the right-hand side:
\[ x - 9 = 2x + 2 \]
Next, we isolate \(x\) by moving all terms involving \(x\) to one side and constant terms to the other side:
\[ x - 2x = 2 + 9 \]
\[ -x = 11 \]
Finally, we solve for \(x\):
\[ x = -11 \]
