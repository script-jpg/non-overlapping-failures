To solve the equation \(\frac{x-9}{x+1} = 2\) for \(x\), we start by ensuring that \(x \neq -1\) to avoid division by zero. We then multiply both sides of the equation by \(x+1\) to eliminate the fraction. This gives us \(x - 9 = 2(x + 1)\). Expanding and simplifying the right-hand side, we get \(x - 9 = 2x + 2\). By isolating \(x\), we find that \(x - 2x = 2 + 9\), which simplifies to \(-x = 11\). Dividing both sides by -1, we obtain \(x = -11\).

  -- We need to show that x + 1 ≠ 0 to avoid division by zero.
  intro h₃
  -- If x + 1 = 0, then x = -1, which contradicts the given condition h₀.
  apply h₀
  -- Solving x + 1 = 0 for x gives x = -1.
  linarith
-- Eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by x + 1.
