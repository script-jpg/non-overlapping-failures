To solve the equation \(\frac{x-9}{x+1} = 2\) for \(x\), we start by ensuring that \(x \neq -1\) to avoid division by zero. We then rewrite the equation to eliminate the fraction through cross-multiplication. This results in a linear equation that can be solved for \(x\) by isolating \(x\) on one side of the equation. The solution to this linear equation is \(x = -11\).
