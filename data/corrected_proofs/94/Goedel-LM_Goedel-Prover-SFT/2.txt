To solve the equation \(\frac{x-9}{x+1} = 2\) for \(x\), we start by ensuring that \(x \neq -1\) to avoid division by zero. We then rewrite the equation by multiplying both sides by \(x+1\) to eliminate the fraction. This gives us \(x-9 = 2(x+1)\). Expanding and simplifying this equation, we get \(x-9 = 2x + 2\). Rearranging the terms to isolate \(x\), we find that \(x = -11\).
