To solve the equation \(\frac{x-9}{x+1} = 2\) for \(x\), we start by ensuring that the denominator is not zero, which is given by \(x \neq -1\). We then rewrite the equation to eliminate the fraction. Multiplying both sides by \(x + 1\) gives \(x - 9 = 2(x + 1)\). Expanding and simplifying this equation, we obtain \(x - 9 = 2x + 2\). Rearranging terms to isolate \(x\), we find \(x - 2x = 2 + 9\), which simplifies to \(-x = 11\). Finally, solving for \(x\), we get \(x = -11\).
