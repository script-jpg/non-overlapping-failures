To solve the equation \(\frac{x-9}{x+1} = 2\) for \(x\), we start by ensuring that \(x \neq -1\) to avoid division by zero. We then manipulate the equation to isolate \(x\). By multiplying both sides by \(x+1\), we get \(x-9 = 2(x+1)\). Expanding and simplifying this equation, we obtain \(x-9 = 2x + 2\). Rearranging the terms to solve for \(x\), we find \(x = -11\).
