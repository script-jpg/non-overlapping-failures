To solve the problem, we need to find the intersection of the lines \(3y = x\) and \(2x + 5y = 11\) and determine the sum of the coordinates of the intersection point.
1. From the equation \(3y = x\), we can substitute \(x\) in the second equation \(2x + 5y = 11\) to get:
   \[
   2(3y) + 5y = 11 \implies 6y + 5y = 11 \implies 11y = 11 \implies y = 1
   \]
2. Substitute \(y = 1\) back into the equation \(3y = x\) to find \(x\):
   \[
   3(1) = x \implies x = 3
   \]
3. Now, we have the coordinates of the intersection point \(A\) as \(A(3, 1)\). The sum of these coordinates is:
   \[
   x + y = 3 + 1 = 4
   \]
Thus, the sum of the coordinates of point \(A\) is indeed 4.

-- Now we have the coordinates of the intersection point A as A(3, 1).
-- The sum of these coordinates is x + y = 3 + 1 = 4.
