Given the lines \(3y = x\) and \(2x + 5y = 11\), we need to find the point \(A\) where these lines intersect. The coordinates of point \(A\) are given by solving the system of equations:
1. \(3y = x\)
2. \(2x + 5y = 11\)
First, substitute \(x = 3y\) into the second equation:
\[ 2(3y) + 5y = 11 \]
\[ 6y + 5y = 11 \]
\[ 11y = 11 \]
\[ y = 1 \]
Next, substitute \(y = 1\) back into \(x = 3y\):
\[ x = 3 \cdot 1 \]
\[ x = 3 \]
Thus, the coordinates of point \(A\) are \((3, 1)\). The sum of the coordinates of point \(A\) is:
\[ x + y = 3 + 1 = 4 \]
