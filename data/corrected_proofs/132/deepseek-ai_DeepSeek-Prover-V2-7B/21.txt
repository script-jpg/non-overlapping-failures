-- Substitute the expression for x from the first equation into the second equation.
have h₂ : x = 3 * y := by linarith
-- Substitute x = 3 * y into the second equation and simplify.
have h₃ : 2 * (3 * y) + 5 * y = 11 := by linarith
-- Solve for y.
have h₄ : y = 1 := by linarith
-- Substitute y = 1 back into the expression for x.
have h₅ : x = 3 * 1 := by linarith
-- Calculate x.
have h₆ : x = 3 := by linarith
-- Sum the coordinates of point A.
