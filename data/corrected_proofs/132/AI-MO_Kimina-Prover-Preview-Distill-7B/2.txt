-- The point $A$ satisfies the condition that the line $3y = x$ intersects the line $2x + 5y = 11$.

  -- We first use the tactic `have` to record the condition that the point $A$ satisfies the equation $3y = x$.
  have h₀ : 3 * y = x := h₀

  -- And it satisfies the condition that the point $A$ lies on the line $2x + 5y = 11$.
  have h₁ : 2 * x + 5 * y = 11 := h₁

  -- Now we should solve the system of equations to find the point $A$.
  -- We use `linarith` to solve the system of equations.
  linarith

  -- The tactic `linarith` is powerful for solving linear arithmetic problems.
  -- It automatically solves the system of linear equations and inequalities to determine the truth of the goal.
  -- In this case, it proves that $x + y = 4$.

  -- To understand what's happening behind the scenes, let's solve the system manually:
  --
  -- From the first equation, we have $x = 3y$.
  -- Substituting into the second equation: $2(3y) + 5y = 11$
  -- This simplifies to: $6y + 5y = 11$
  -- So: $11y = 11$
  -- Therefore: $y = 1$
  -- Substituting $y = 1$ back into $x = 3y$ gives: $x = 3(1) = 3$
  -- Thus: $x = 3, y = 1$
  -- Therefore: $x + y = 3 + 1 = 4$
  --
  -- The Lean proof is remarkably concise because `linarith` automates all these steps for us.
  --
  -- The complete solution demonstrates how Lean's automation can efficiently handle systems of linear equations,
  -- reducing what would be multiple steps of algebraic manipulation by hand to a single tactic invocation.
