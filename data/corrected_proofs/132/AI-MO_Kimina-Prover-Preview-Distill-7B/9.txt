-- The point $A$ is the intersection of $3y = x$ and $2x + 5y = 11$
have h : x = 3 * y := by linarith
rw [h] at h₁
-- We get $3y = x = 3 \cdot \frac{11}{11} = 3$
have h₂ : 11 * y = 11 := by linarith
have h₃ : y = 1 := by linarith
-- So $x = 3 \cdot 1 = 3$
have h₄ : x = 3 := by linarith
-- So the sum of the coordinates of point $A$ is $x + y = 3 + 1 = 4$
