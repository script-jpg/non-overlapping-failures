To show that for any real number \( a \), \( a(2-a) \leq 1 \), we start by rewriting the inequality in a more manageable form. We can express \( a(2-a) \) as \( 2a - a^2 \). The inequality \( 2a - a^2 \leq 1 \) can be rewritten as \( a^2 - 2a + 1 \geq 0 \). This is equivalent to \( (a-1)^2 \geq 0 \), which is always true since the square of any real number is non-negative. Therefore, we have shown that \( a(2-a) \leq 1 \) for any real number \( a \).

-- Use the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative to prove the inequality.
-- Specifically, we use the non-negativity of (a - 1)^2.
