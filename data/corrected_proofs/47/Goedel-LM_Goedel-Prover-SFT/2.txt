To show that for any real number \( a \), \( a(2 - a) \leq 1 \), we start by considering the expression \( a(2 - a) \). We aim to prove that this expression is always less than or equal to 1. 
First, we rewrite the expression \( a(2 - a) \) as \( 2a - a^2 \). We then use the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative to show that \( (a - 1)^2 \geq 0 \). Expanding \( (a - 1)^2 \) gives \( a^2 - 2a + 1 \), which is non-negative. Adding 1 to both sides of the inequality \( a^2 - 2a + 1 \geq 0 \) results in \( a^2 - 2a + 2 \geq 1 \). Rearranging this inequality yields \( a^2 - 2a + 2 \geq 1 \), which simplifies to \( 2a - a^2 \leq 1 \).
Thus, we have shown that \( a(2 - a) \leq 1 \).
