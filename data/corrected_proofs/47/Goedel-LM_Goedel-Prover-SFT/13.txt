To show that for any real number \( a \), \( a(2-a) \leq 1 \), we start by rewriting the expression \( a(2-a) \) in a form that makes it easier to analyze. We can express \( a(2-a) \) as \( 2a - a^2 \). This is a quadratic function in terms of \( a \), and its maximum value can be found by completing the square or by analyzing its vertex. The vertex of the quadratic function \( -a^2 + 2a \) is at \( a = 1 \), where the value is 1. Since the coefficient of \( a^2 \) is negative, the quadratic function opens downwards, and thus the maximum value is 1. Therefore, \( 2a - a^2 \leq 1 \).
