To show that for any real number \( a \), \( a(2 - a) \leq 1 \), we start by rewriting the inequality in a form that allows us to use algebraic manipulations and known inequalities. Specifically, we can express the inequality as:
\[ a(2 - a) \leq 1 \]
We can rewrite this as:
\[ a \cdot 2 - a^2 \leq 1 \]
Next, we rearrange the terms to form a standard quadratic inequality:
\[ a^2 - 2a + 1 \geq 0 \]
This can be recognized as a perfect square:
\[ (a - 1)^2 \geq 0 \]
Since the square of any real number is always non-negative, we have:
\[ (a - 1)^2 \geq 0 \]
Thus, the inequality \( a(2 - a) \leq 1 \) holds for all real numbers \( a \).
