To show that for any real number \( a \), \( a(2 - a) \leq 1 \), we can use the method of completing the square and analyzing the resulting expression. Specifically, we can rewrite the expression \( a(2 - a) \) in a form that makes it clear it is always less than or equal to 1.
1. Start with the expression \( a(2 - a) \).
2. Expand and rearrange the terms to form a square of a binomial.
3. Recognize that the square of any real number is non-negative, and thus the expression is less than or equal to 1.

-- We use this property to show that the expression a(2 - a) is less than or equal to 1.
-- Specifically, we consider the expression (a - 1)^2, which is non-negative.
