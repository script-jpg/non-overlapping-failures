To evaluate \(\left(\frac{i}{2}\right)^2\), we start by expressing the square of the complex number \(\frac{i}{2}\). We use the property of the square of a quotient, which states that \((a \div b)^2 = a^2 \div b^2\). Here, \(a = i\) and \(b = 2\). Thus, we have:
\[
\left(\frac{i}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{i^2}{2^2}
\]
Next, we compute the squares of the numerator and the denominator. The square of \(i\) is \(-1\), and the square of \(2\) is \(4\). Therefore, we get:
\[
\frac{i^2}{2^2} = \frac{-1}{4}
\]
This completes the evaluation.
