To evaluate \(\left(\frac{i}{2}\right)^2\) and show that it is \(-\frac{1}{4}\), we proceed as follows:
1. Start by expressing the square of the complex number \(\frac{i}{2}\).
2. Use the property of the square of a complex number, which is \(\text{Complex.I}^2 = -1\).
3. Substitute \(\text{Complex.I}^2\) with \(-1\) in the expression.
4. Simplify the resulting expression by dividing by 4 and multiplying by \(-1\).
