To evaluate \(\left(\frac{i}{2}\right)^2\), we start by expressing the square of the complex number \(\frac{i}{2}\). We use the property of the square of a product, which gives us \(\left(\frac{i}{2}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{i}{2}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{i}{2}\right)\). Expanding this product, we get \(\frac{i^2}{4}\). Since \(i^2 = -1\), we substitute \(-1\) for \(i^2\) in the expression, yielding \(\frac{-1}{4}\). Simplifying this result, we obtain \(-\frac{1}{4}\).
