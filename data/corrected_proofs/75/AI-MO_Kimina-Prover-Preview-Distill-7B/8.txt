-- We'll compute the remainder of the 100th Fibonacci number modulo 4 directly.
-- This requires identifying a pattern in the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4.
-- Let's compute the first few terms modulo 4:
-- a 1 = 1 (mod 4)
-- a 2 = 1 (mod 4)
-- a 3 = 2 (mod 4)
-- a 4 = 3 (mod 4)
-- a 5 = 5 (mod 4) -> 1
-- a 6 = 8 (mod 4) -> 0
-- a 7 = 13 (mod 4) -> 1
-- a 8 = 21 (mod 4) -> 1
-- a 9 = 34 (mod 4) -> 2
-- a 10 = 55 (mod 4) -> 3
-- a 11 = 89 (mod 4) -> 1
-- a 12 = 144 (mod 4) -> 0
--...
-- We observe that the pattern repeats every 6 terms: 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0
-- Since 100 = 6 * 16 + 4, the 100th term corresponds to the 4th term in the pattern
-- The 4th term is 3 (mod 4)
-- Therefore, a 100 % 4 = 3

-- Let's prove this by explicitly calculating the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4
-- We'll use a recursive approach with memoization to handle large indices efficiently
have : a 100 % 4 = 3 := by
  -- We compute a 100 using the recursive definition
  -- Since Lean will compute this automatically with our definition, we can directly prove it equals 3
