To determine the remainder when the 100th term of the Fibonacci sequence is divided by 4, we need to analyze the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4. The Fibonacci sequence is defined by \( a_1 = a_2 = 1 \) and \( a_{n+2} = a_{n+1} + a_n \). We will compute the sequence modulo 4 up to the 100th term and find the remainder.
