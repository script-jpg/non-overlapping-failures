To solve the problem of finding the remainder when the 100th term of the Fibonacci sequence is divided by 4, we start by understanding the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4. The Fibonacci sequence modulo 4 has a periodic pattern. We need to determine the period and then use it to find the 100th term modulo 4.
1. **Understanding the Fibonacci Sequence Modulo 4**:
   - The Fibonacci sequence is defined by \( a_1 = 1 \), \( a_2 = 1 \), and \( a_{n+2} = a_{n+1} + a_n \).
   - We need to find the period of the sequence modulo 4.
2. **Periodicity of the Fibonacci Sequence Modulo 4**:
   - By computing the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4, we observe a periodic pattern.
   - The sequence repeats every 6 terms modulo 4.
3. **Finding the 100th Term Modulo 4**:
   - Since the sequence repeats every 6 terms, we can reduce 100 modulo 6 to find the equivalent term in the sequence.
   - \( 100 \mod 6 = 4 \).
   - Therefore, the 100th term is the same as the 4th term in the sequence.
4. **Calculating the 4th Term Modulo 4**:
   - Using the definition of the Fibonacci sequence, we compute the 4th term modulo 4.
   - \( a_4 = a_3 + a_2 \).
   - \( a_3 = a_2 + a_1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \).
   - \( a_4 = 2 + 1 = 3 \).
5. **Conclusion**:
   - The 100th term of the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4 is 3.
