To determine the remainder when the 100th term of the Fibonacci sequence is divided by 4, we need to compute the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4 up to the 100th term. The Fibonacci sequence is defined by \( F_1 = F_2 = 1 \) and \( F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_n \). We will compute the sequence modulo 4 and observe the periodicity.
1. Compute the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4 up to the 100th term.
2. Observe the periodicity of the sequence modulo 4.
3. Use the periodicity to determine the remainder of the 100th term modulo 4.
