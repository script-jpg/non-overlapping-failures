To determine the remainder when the 100th term of the Fibonacci sequence is divided by 4, we start by analyzing the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4. The Fibonacci sequence is defined by \( F_1 = 1 \), \( F_2 = 1 \), and \( F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_n \). We need to compute the sequence modulo 4 up to the 100th term and observe the periodicity.
1. Compute the first few terms of the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4:
   - \( F_1 = 1 \)
   - \( F_2 = 1 \)
   - \( F_3 = 2 \)
   - \( F_4 = 3 \)
   - \( F_5 = 1 \)
   - \( F_6 = 2 \)
   - \( F_7 = 3 \)
   - \( F_8 = 1 \)
2. Notice the periodicity: \( F_3 \equiv 2 \mod 4 \), \( F_4 \equiv 3 \mod 4 \), and \( F_5 \equiv 1 \mod 4 \). This pattern repeats every 4 terms.
3. Since the sequence repeats every 4 terms, the 100th term \( F_{100} \) corresponds to the 4th term in the sequence modulo 4.
4. The 4th term in the sequence modulo 4 is 3.
Thus, the remainder when the 100th term of the Fibonacci sequence is divided by 4 is 3.
