To prove that the volume of a cone is 65 cubic units, we start by using the formula for the volume of a cone, which is given by \( V = \frac{1}{3}Bh \), where \( B \) is the area of the base and \( h \) is the height. We are provided with the area of the base \( B = 30 \) square units and the height \( h = 6.5 \) units. Substituting these values into the volume formula, we get:
\[ V = \frac{1}{3} \times 30 \times 6.5 \]
First, we perform the multiplication:
\[ 30 \times 6.5 = 195 \]
Next, we multiply the result by \( \frac{1}{3} \):
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 195 = 65 \]
Thus, the volume \( V \) of the cone is indeed 65 cubic units.
