To show that the volume \( V \) of a cone is 65 cubic units given the base area \( B = 30 \) square units and the height \( h = 6.5 \) units, we use the formula \( V = \frac{1}{3}Bh \). Substituting the given values into the formula, we compute:
\[
V = \frac{1}{3} \times 30 \times 6.5 = \frac{1}{3} \times 225 = 75
\]
However, this result does not match the expected volume of 65 cubic units. Let's re-evaluate the steps to ensure accuracy.
