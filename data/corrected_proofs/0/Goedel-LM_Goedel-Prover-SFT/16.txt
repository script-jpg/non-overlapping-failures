To prove that the volume of a cone with base area \(30\) square units and height \(6.5\) units is \(65\) cubic units, we start by using the formula for the volume of a cone, \(V = \frac{1}{3}Bh\), where \(B\) is the base area and \(h\) is the height. Given \(B = 30\) and \(h = 6.5\), we substitute these values into the formula and simplify to verify that \(V = 65\).
