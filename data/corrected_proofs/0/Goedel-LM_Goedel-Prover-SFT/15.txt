To show that the volume of a cone with base area 30 square units and height 6.5 units is 65 cubic units, we start by using the formula for the volume of a cone, \( V = \frac{1}{3}Bh \), where \( B \) is the area of the base and \( h \) is the height. Given \( B = 30 \) square units and \( h = 6.5 \) units, we substitute these values into the formula:
\[ V = \frac{1}{3} \times 30 \times 6.5 \]
First, we calculate the product inside the fraction:
\[ 30 \times 6.5 = 195 \]
Next, we multiply by \(\frac{1}{3}\):
\[ \frac{1}{3} \times 195 = 65 \]
Thus, the volume \( V \) is indeed 65 cubic units.
