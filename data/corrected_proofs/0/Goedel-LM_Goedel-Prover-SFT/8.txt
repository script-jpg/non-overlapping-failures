Given the volume \( V \) of a cone is given by the formula \( V = \frac{1}{3}Bh \), where \( B \) is the area of the base and \( h \) is the height. The area of the base of a cone is 30 square units, and its height is 6.5 units. We need to find the number of cubic units in its volume and show that it is 65.
1. Substitute the given values for \( B \) and \( h \) into the volume formula.
2. Simplify the expression using algebraic operations.
3. Verify that the result matches the expected volume of 65 cubic units.
