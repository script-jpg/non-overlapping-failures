To find the volume of a cone, we use the formula \( V = \frac{1}{3} B h \), where \( B \) is the area of the base and \( h \) is the height. Given the area of the base \( B = 30 \) square units and the height \( h = 6.5 \) units, we substitute these values into the formula to find the volume.
1. Substitute \( B = 30 \) and \( h = 6.5 \) into the volume formula:
   \[
   V = \frac{1}{3} \times 30 \times 6.5
   \]
2. Simplify the expression:
   \[
   V = \frac{1}{3} \times 210 = 70
   \]
3. Verify that the volume \( V \) is indeed 65 cubic units.
