To prove that the volume of the cone is 65 cubic units, we start by using the formula for the volume of a cone \( V = \frac{1}{3}Bh \), where \( B \) is the area of the base and \( h \) is the height. Given that the area of the base \( B \) is 30 square units and the height \( h \) is 6.5 units, we substitute these values into the formula.
1. Substitute \( B = 30 \) and \( h = 6.5 \) into the volume formula \( V = \frac{1}{3}Bh \).
2. Calculate the product \( 30 \times 6.5 \).
3. Divide the result by 3 to find the volume.
