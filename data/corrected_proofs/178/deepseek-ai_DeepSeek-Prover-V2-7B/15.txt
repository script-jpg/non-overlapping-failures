have h₂ : a = 1 := by
  -- We need to solve for `a` using the given equations.
  -- First, we use the second equation to express `b` in terms of `a`.
  have h₂₀ : b = 2 - a := by linarith
  -- Substitute `b = 2 - a` into the first equation.
  rw [h₂₀] at h₀
  -- Simplify the equation to solve for `a`.

have h₃ : b = 1 := by
  -- Now that we have `a = 1`, substitute it back into the second equation to find `b`.
  have h₃₀ : b = 2 - a := by linarith
