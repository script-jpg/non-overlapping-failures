We aim to show that for any real number \( x \) and any natural number \( n \), if \( x > -1 \), then \( (1 + nx) \leq (1 + x)^n \). We proceed by induction on \( n \).
1. **Base Case**: When \( n = 1 \), the inequality simplifies to \( 1 + x \leq 1 + x \), which holds trivially.
2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement holds for some \( n \). We need to show it holds for \( n + 1 \). Using the properties of exponents and the fact that \( x > -1 \), we can derive the inequality for \( n + 1 \) by leveraging the inductive hypothesis and algebraic manipulation.
