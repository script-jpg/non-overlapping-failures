To determine how many integers between 15 and 85 are divisible by 20, we need to find the number of integers that satisfy the condition \(15 \leq x \leq 85\) and \(20 \mid x\).
1. **Identify the range and divisible condition**: We are looking for integers \(x\) such that \(15 \leq x \leq 85\) and \(20 \mid x\).
2. **Find the smallest and largest multiples of 20 within the range**:
   - The smallest multiple of 20 greater than or equal to 15 is \(20 \times 1 = 20\).
   - The largest multiple of 20 less than or equal to 85 is \(20 \times 4 = 80\).
3. **Count the multiples of 20**:
   - The sequence of multiples of 20 in the range is \(20, 40, 60, 80\).
   - There are exactly 4 terms in this sequence.
4. **Conclusion**: There are 4 integers between 15 and 85 that are divisible by 20.
