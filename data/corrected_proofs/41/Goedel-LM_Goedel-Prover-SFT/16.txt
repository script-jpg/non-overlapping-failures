To determine how many integers between 15 and 85 are divisible by 20, we start by identifying the integers within this range that are divisible by 20. These integers are multiples of 20. We need to find the smallest and largest such multiples within the range.
1. The smallest multiple of 20 greater than or equal to 15 is 20.
2. The largest multiple of 20 less than or equal to 85 is 80.
Next, we count the number of multiples of 20 between 20 and 80. The sequence of multiples of 20 in this range is \(20, 40, 60, 80\). There are exactly 4 such multiples.
Thus, the number of integers between 15 and 85 that are divisible by 20 is 4.

-- We need to show that the cardinality of the set of numbers between 15 and 85 that are divisible by 20 is 4.
-- This set can be represented as `Finset.filter (fun x => 20 ∣ x) (Finset.Icc 15 85)`.
