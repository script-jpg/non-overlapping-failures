To determine how many integers between 15 and 85 are divisible by 20, we start by identifying the range of integers that satisfy this condition. The integers between 15 and 85 that are divisible by 20 are 20, 40, 60, and 80. This sequence forms an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a = 20\) and the common difference \(d = 20\). The number of terms in this sequence can be found by solving for \(n\) in the equation:
\[
a_n = 20n \leq 85
\]
Since \(a_n = 20n\) must be less than or equal to 85, we have:
\[
20n \leq 85 \implies n \leq \frac{85}{20} = 4.25
\]
Thus, there are 4 terms in this sequence, confirming that there are 4 integers between 15 and 85 that are divisible by 20.
