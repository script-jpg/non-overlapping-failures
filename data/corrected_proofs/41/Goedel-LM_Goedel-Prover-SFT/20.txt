To determine how many integers between 15 and 85 are divisible by 20, we need to count the numbers in this range that are divisible by 20. We can use the properties of finite sets and modular arithmetic to find these numbers.
1. **Identify the range and divisibility condition**: We are interested in the numbers \( x \) in the range from 15 to 85 that satisfy \( 20 \mid x \).
2. **Simplify the problem using modular arithmetic**: The condition \( 20 \mid x \) can be rewritten as \( x \mod 20 = 0 \). This means \( x \) must be a multiple of 20.
3. **Find the smallest and largest multiples of 20 within the given range**:
   - The smallest multiple of 20 greater than or equal to 15 is 20.
   - The largest multiple of 20 less than or equal to 85 is 80.
4. **Count the multiples of 20**: The multiples of 20 between 20 and 80 are 20, 40, 60, and 80. This gives us 4 numbers.
Thus, the number of integers between 15 and 85 that are divisible by 20 is 4.
