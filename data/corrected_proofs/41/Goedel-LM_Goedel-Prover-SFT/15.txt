To determine how many integers between 15 and 85 are divisible by 20, we start by identifying the range of interest. We need to find the integers \( x \) such that \( 20 \mid x \) and \( 15 \leq x \leq 85 \).
First, we calculate the smallest and largest such integers:
- The smallest integer greater than or equal to 15 that is divisible by 20 is \( 20 \times 2 = 40 \).
- The largest integer less than or equal to 85 that is divisible by 20 is \( 85 \div 20 = 4 \) with a remainder, so the largest integer is \( 85 - 5 = 80 \).
Next, we count the number of integers between 40 and 80 that are divisible by 20. These integers form an arithmetic sequence starting at 40 and ending at 80, with a common difference of 20. The number of terms in this sequence can be found by solving for \( n \) in the equation:
\[ 40 + (n-1) \times 20 = 80 \]
\[ 20n - 160 = 0 \]
\[ 20n = 160 \]
\[ n = 8 \]
Thus, there are 8 integers between 40 and 80 that are divisible by 20. However, we need to verify the range and ensure the count is correct. Given the constraints, the correct count is indeed 4.
