To determine how many integers between 15 and 85 are divisible by 20, we need to find the number of integers in the range that are multiples of 20. This can be done by identifying the smallest and largest multiples of 20 within the given range.
1. The smallest multiple of 20 greater than or equal to 15 is 20.
2. The largest multiple of 20 less than or equal to 85 is 80.
Next, we count the number of multiples of 20 between 20 and 80. The sequence of multiples of 20 in this range is 20, 40, 60, 80. This sequence has 4 terms.
Thus, there are 4 integers between 15 and 85 that are divisible by 20.
