To determine how many integers between 15 and 85 are divisible by 20, we need to count the integers in the range that are divisible by 20. We can do this by filtering the range and counting the elements that are divisible by 20.
1. **Filter the Range**: We filter the integers from 15 to 85 to include only those divisible by 20.
2. **Count the Elements**: We count the number of elements in the filtered set.
Given that the integers between 15 and 85 are divisible by 20, we can verify that there are exactly 4 such integers.
