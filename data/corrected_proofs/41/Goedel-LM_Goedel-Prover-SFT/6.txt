To determine the number of integers between 15 and 85 that are divisible by 20, we start by identifying the range of integers divisible by 20 within the given bounds. The smallest integer greater than or equal to 15 that is divisible by 20 is 20, and the largest integer less than or equal to 85 that is divisible by 20 is 80. We then count the number of such integers.

-- We need to show that the number of integers between 15 and 85 that are divisible by 20 is 4.
-- First, we identify the range of integers divisible by 20 within the given bounds.
-- The smallest integer greater than or equal to 15 that is divisible by 20 is 20.
-- The largest integer less than or equal to 85 that is divisible by 20 is 80.
-- We then count the number of such integers.
