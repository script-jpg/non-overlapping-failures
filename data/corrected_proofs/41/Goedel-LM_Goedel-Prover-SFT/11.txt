To determine how many integers between 15 and 85 are divisible by 20, we need to find the number of integers that lie on the interval \([15, 85]\) and are multiples of 20. We can express this as finding the number of integers \(x\) in the interval \([15, 85]\) such that \(20 \mid x\).
First, we identify the smallest and largest multiples of 20 within the interval \([15, 85]\). The smallest multiple of 20 greater than or equal to 15 is 20, and the largest multiple of 20 less than or equal to 85 is 80.
Next, we count the number of integers between these two bounds that are multiples of 20. The sequence of multiples of 20 in this range is \(20, 40, 60, 80\). This sequence is an arithmetic sequence with the first term \(a = 20\) and common difference \(d = 20\).
To find the number of terms in this sequence, we use the formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:
\[ a_n = a + (n-1)d \]
Setting \(a_n = 80\), we solve for \(n\):
\[ 80 = 20 + (n-1) \cdot 20 \]
\[ 80 = 20 + 20n - 20 \]
\[ 80 = 20n \]
\[ n = 4 \]
Thus, there are 4 integers between 15 and 85 that are divisible by 20.
