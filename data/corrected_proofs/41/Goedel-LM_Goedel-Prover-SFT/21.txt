To determine how many integers between 15 and 85 are divisible by 20, we need to count the numbers in the range that are divisible by 20. We start by identifying the smallest and largest such numbers. The smallest number greater than or equal to 15 that is divisible by 20 is 20, and the largest number less than or equal to 85 that is divisible by 20 is 80. We then count the multiples of 20 in this range. The sequence of multiples of 20 in this range is 20, 40, 60, and 80. Thus, there are exactly 4 such numbers.
