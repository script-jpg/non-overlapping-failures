To determine how many integers between 15 and 85 are divisible by 20, we need to count the integers that satisfy this condition. We start by identifying the range of integers and the divisibility condition. The integers between 15 and 85 are 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68, 72, 76, 80, 84. We then filter these integers to find those divisible by 20. The integers divisible by 20 within this range are 20, 40, 60, and 80. Counting these, we find there are exactly 4 such integers.
