To solve the expression \(\sqrt{1,000,000} - \sqrt[3]{1,000,000}\), we start by simplifying the terms. 
1. \(\sqrt{1,000,000} = 1000\) because \(1000^2 = 1,000,000\).
2. \(\sqrt[3]{1,000,000} = 1000\) because \(1000^3 = 1,000,000\).
Thus, the expression simplifies to \(1000 - 1000 = 0\). However, we need to verify that the correct value is 900. This suggests a potential error in the initial simplification or interpretation of the problem.
