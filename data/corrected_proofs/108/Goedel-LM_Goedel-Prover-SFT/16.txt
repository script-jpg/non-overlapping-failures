To expand the expression \((x+3)(2x-6)\), we use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials). This involves multiplying each term in the first binomial by each term in the second binomial and then combining like terms. Specifically, we calculate:
\[
(x + 3)(2x - 6) = x \cdot 2x + x \cdot (-6) + 3 \cdot 2x + 3 \cdot (-6)
\]
Simplifying each term, we get:
\[
2x^2 - 6x + 6x - 18
\]
Combining like terms, we obtain:
\[
2x^2 - 18
\]
Thus, the expanded form of \((x+3)(2x-6)\) is indeed \(2x^2 - 18\).
