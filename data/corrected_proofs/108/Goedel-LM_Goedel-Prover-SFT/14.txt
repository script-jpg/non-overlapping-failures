To prove that \((x + 3)(2x - 6) = 2x^2 - 18\), we start by expanding the left-hand side of the equation. We use the distributive property to multiply each term in the first binomial by each term in the second binomial. This results in:
\[
(x + 3)(2x - 6) = x \cdot 2x + x \cdot (-6) + 3 \cdot 2x + 3 \cdot (-6)
\]
Simplifying each term, we get:
\[
2x^2 - 6x + 6x - 18
\]
Combining like terms, we obtain:
\[
2x^2 - 18
\]
Thus, the expanded form of \((x + 3)(2x - 6)\) is indeed \(2x^2 - 18\).
