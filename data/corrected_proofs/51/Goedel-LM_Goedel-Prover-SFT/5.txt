Given that \( f(x) \) is an invertible function and \( f(2) = f^{-1}(2) = 4 \), we need to determine the value of \( f(f(2)) \). Since \( f \) is invertible, we can use the properties of the inverse function to find the desired value. Specifically, we know that \( f(2) = 4 \) and \( f^{-1}(4) = 2 \). Applying \( f \) again to both sides of the equation \( f(2) = 4 \) yields \( f(f(2)) = f(4) \). Given the symmetry and the properties of the inverse function, we can deduce that \( f(4) = 2 \).

-- Using the given equality f(2) = f⁻¹(2) = 4, we apply f to both sides of the equation f(2) = 4.
-- This gives us f(f(2)) = f(4).
