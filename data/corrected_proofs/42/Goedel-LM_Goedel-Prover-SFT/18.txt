To determine the remainder when the sum \(2000 + 2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006\) is divided by 7, we can use modular arithmetic. First, we observe the remainders of each number when divided by 7:
- \(2000 \mod 7 = 6\)
- \(2001 \mod 7 = 0\)
- \(2002 \mod 7 = 1\)
- \(2003 \mod 7 = 2\)
- \(2004 \mod 7 = 3\)
- \(2005 \mod 7 = 4\)
- \(2006 \mod 7 = 5\)
Adding these remainders together:
\[6 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 21\]
Finally, we find the remainder of 21 when divided by 7:
\[21 \mod 7 = 0\]
Thus, the remainder when \(2000 + 2001 + 2002 + 2003 + 2004 + 2005 + 2006\) is divided by 7 is 0.

-- Simplify the expression using modular arithmetic properties.
-- We know that 2000 % 7 = 6, 2001 % 7 = 0, 2002 % 7 = 1, 2003 % 7 = 2, 2004 % 7 = 3, 2005 % 7 = 4, 2006 % 7 = 5.
-- Adding these remainders: 6 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 21.
-- Since 21 % 7 = 0, the remainder of the original sum when divided by 7 is 0.
