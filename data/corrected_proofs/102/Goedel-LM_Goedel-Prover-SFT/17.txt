To solve the equation \(\sqrt{19 + 3y} = 7\), we start by squaring both sides to eliminate the square root, yielding \(19 + 3y = 49\). Solving for \(y\), we isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtracting 19 from both sides gives \(3y = 30\). Finally, dividing both sides by 3 yields \(y = 10\).
