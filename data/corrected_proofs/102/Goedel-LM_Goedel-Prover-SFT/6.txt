To solve the equation \(\sqrt{19 + 3y} = 7\), we start by ensuring that the square root is applied correctly, which means the expression inside the square root must be non-negative. We then square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root. This leads to a linear equation that can be solved for \(y\).
1. **Non-negativity Check**: We need to verify that \(19 + 3y \geq 0\).
2. **Square Both Sides**: Squaring both sides of \(\sqrt{19 + 3y} = 7\) gives \(19 + 3y = 49\).
3. **Solve for \(y\)**: Rearrange the equation \(19 + 3y = 49\) to solve for \(y\):
   \[
   3y = 49 - 19
   \]
   \[
   3y = 30
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{30}{3}
   \]
   \[
   y = 10
   \]
