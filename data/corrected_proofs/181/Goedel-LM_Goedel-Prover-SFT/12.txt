To solve for \( f(84) \), we need to follow the recursive definition of the function \( f \):
1. If \( n \geq 1000 \), then \( f(n) = n - 3 \).
2. If \( n < 1000 \), then \( f(n) = f(f(n + 5)) \).
Given \( n = 84 \), we first check if \( 84 \geq 1000 \). Since \( 84 < 1000 \), we use the second definition:
\[ f(84) = f(f(84 + 5)) = f(f(89)) \]
Next, we need to evaluate \( f(89) \):
\[ 89 < 1000 \implies f(89) = f(f(89 + 5)) = f(f(94)) \]
Continuing this process:
\[ 94 < 1000 \implies f(94) = f(f(94 + 5)) = f(f(99)) \]
\[ 99 < 1000 \implies f(99) = f(f(99 + 5)) = f(f(104)) \]
\[ 104 \geq 1000 \implies f(104) = 104 - 3 = 101 \]
Thus, we have:
\[ f(99) = f(101) = 101 - 3 = 98 \]
\[ f(94) = f(98) = 98 - 3 = 95 \]
\[ f(89) = f(95) = 95 - 3 = 92 \]
\[ f(84) = f(92) = 92 - 3 = 89 \]
However, this process is incorrect. Let's re-evaluate the steps carefully.

-- This line uses the recursive definition to evaluate f(84)
-- Since 84 < 1000, we use h₁ to get f(84) = f(f(89))
