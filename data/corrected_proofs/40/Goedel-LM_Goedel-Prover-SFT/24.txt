To solve the problem, we start by equating the given functions \( f(t) = t^4 \) and \( g(t) = 5t^2 - 6 \) at the points \( x \) and \( y \). This gives us the equations \( x^4 = 5x^2 - 6 \) and \( y^4 = 5y^2 - 6 \). We then use the fact that \( x^2 < y^2 \) to infer that \( y^2 - x^2 \) is positive. By manipulating these equations, we can derive that \( y^2 - x^2 = 1 \).
