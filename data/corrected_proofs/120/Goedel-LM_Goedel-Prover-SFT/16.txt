To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the function \( f \) composed multiple times, starting from \( n = 4 \). The function \( f \) is defined such that:
- If \( n \) is odd, \( f(n) = n^2 \).
- If \( n \) is even, \( f(n) = n^2 - 4n - 1 \).
We start by evaluating \( f(4) \). Since 4 is even, we use the second definition of \( f \):
\[ f(4) = 4^2 - 4 \cdot 4 - 1 \]
Calculating each term:
\[ 4^2 = 16 \]
\[ 4 \cdot 4 = 16 \]
\[ 16 - 16 = 0 \]
\[ 0 - 1 = -1 \]
Thus, \( f(4) = -1 \).
