To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the function \( f \) composed with itself five times, starting from \( n = 4 \). The function \( f \) is defined piecewise based on whether \( n \) is odd or even:
- \( f(n) = n^2 \) if \( n \) is odd.
- \( f(n) = n^2 - 4n - 1 \) if \( n \) is even.
First, we evaluate \( f(4) \):
- Since 4 is even, we use the second definition:
\[ f(4) = 4^2 - 4 \cdot 4 - 1 \]
Calculating the expression:
\[ 4^2 = 16 \]
\[ 4 \cdot 4 = 16 \]
\[ 16 - 16 - 1 = -1 \]
Thus, \( f(4) = -1 \).
