To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the function \( f \) at \( n = 4 \) given the conditions for odd and even \( n \). The function \( f \) is defined as follows:
\[ f(n) = \begin{cases} 
n^2 & \text{if } n \text{ is odd} \\
n^2 - 4n - 1 & \text{if } n \text{ is even}
\end{cases} \]
First, we evaluate \( f(4) \). Since 4 is even, we use the second case of the function definition:
\[ f(4) = 4^2 - 4 \cdot 4 - 1 \]
Calculating the right-hand side:
\[ 4^2 = 16 \]
\[ 4 \cdot 4 = 16 \]
\[ 16 - 16 - 1 = -1 \]
Thus, we have:
\[ f(4) = -1 \]

-- Evaluate f(4) using the definition of f for even n
have : f 4 = 4 ^ 2 - 4 * 4 - 1 := h₁ 4 (by decide)
-- Simplify the expression using basic arithmetic operations
