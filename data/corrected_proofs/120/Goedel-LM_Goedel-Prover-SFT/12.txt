To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the function \( f \) composed multiple times with the given conditions. The function \( f \) is defined piecewise based on whether \( n \) is odd or even. We start by evaluating \( f(4) \).
1. Since 4 is even, we use the second condition: \( f(4) = 4^2 - 4 \cdot 4 - 1 \).
2. Calculate the right-hand side: \( 4^2 = 16 \), \( 4 \cdot 4 = 16 \).
3. Substitute back into the equation: \( f(4) = 16 - 16 - 1 = -1 \).
Thus, \( f(4) = -1 \).
