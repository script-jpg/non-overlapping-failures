-- We need to show that the number of integers satisfying $|x-2| \leq 5.6$ is 11.

  -- First, we determine the integer solutions. The inequality $|x-2| \leq 5.6$ means that $x$ is within 5.6 units of 2.
  -- So, the smallest integer $x$ can be is $2 - 5.6 = -3.6$, which is $-3$ when rounded up.
  -- The largest integer $x$ can be is $2 + 5.6 = 7.6$, which is $7$ when rounded down.
  -- Therefore, the integer solutions are $-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7$ -- a total of 11 integers.

  -- We need to formalize this in Lean 4.
  -- We'll start by setting up the framework:

  have h₁ : S = Finset.Icc (-3) 7 := by
    ext n
    simp [h₀]
    constructor
    · intro hn
      rw [abs_le] at hn
      -- We know that |n - 2| ≤ 5.6, which means -5.6 ≤ n - 2 ≤ 5.6.
      -- So, -3.6 ≤ n ≤ 7.6.
      -- Since n is an integer, we have -3 ≤ n ≤ 7.
      have hn' : -3 ≤ n ∧ n ≤ 7 := by
        constructor
        · linarith [hn.1]
        · linarith [hn.2]
      exact hn'
    · intro hn
      rw [abs_le]
      -- We need to show that if -3 ≤ n ≤ 7, then |n - 2| ≤ 5.6.
      -- This is true because the maximum value of |n - 2| in this range is when n is at the endpoints.
      -- When n = -3, |n - 2| = 5
      -- When n = 7, |n - 2| = 5.45
      -- So, |n - 2| ≤ 5.6 is satisfied.
      have hn' : -3 ≤ n ∧ n ≤ 7 := hn
      constructor <;> linarith

  -- Now, we can calculate the number of integers in the range [-3, 7].
  -- The number of integers from a to b inclusive is b - a + 1.
  -- So, for [-3, 7], it's 7 - (-3) + 1 = 7 + 3 + 1 = 11.
