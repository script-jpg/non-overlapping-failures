To determine how many integers are in the solution set of \( |x - 2| \leq 5.6 \), we need to find the range of integers \( n \) such that \( |n - 2| \leq 5.6 \). This inequality can be split into two parts:
\[ -5.6 \leq n - 2 \leq 5.6 \]
Adding 2 to all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[ -3.6 \leq n \leq 7.6 \]
Since \( n \) must be an integer, we count the integers within this range:
\[ -3.6 \leq n \leq 7.6 \]
The integers in this range are \( -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \). There are 11 integers in this range.
