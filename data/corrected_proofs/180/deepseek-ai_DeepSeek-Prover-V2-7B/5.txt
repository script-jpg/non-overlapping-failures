have h₂ : a + 20 * d = 135 := by
  -- We need to find the common difference 'd' and the first term 'a' using the given equations.
  -- From the first equation, we have: a + 6d = 30
  -- From the second equation, we have: a + 10d = 60
  -- We can solve these equations simultaneously to find 'a' and 'd'.
  linarith
-- The solution is straightforward after finding 'a' and 'd'.
