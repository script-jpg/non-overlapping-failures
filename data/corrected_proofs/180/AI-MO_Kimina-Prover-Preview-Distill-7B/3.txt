-- The 7th term is $a + 6d = 30$.
-- The 11th term is $a + 10d = 60$.
-- The 21st term is $a + 20d$.

-- Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get $4d = 30$, so $d = 30/4 = 15/2$.

  linarith

-- Substituting $d = 15/2$ into $a + 6d = 30$, we get $a + 6 * (15/2) = 30$,
-- so $a + 45 = 30$, so $a = -15$.

  linarith

-- So the 21st term is $a + 20d = -15 + 20 * (15/2) = -15 + 150 = 135$.
