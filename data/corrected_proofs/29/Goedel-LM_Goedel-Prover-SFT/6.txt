Given that the enrollment of Liberty Middle School increased to 598 students, which is an increase of 4% over last year's enrollment, we need to determine last year's enrollment. Let \( x \) be last year's enrollment. The equation representing the increase is:
\[ x + \frac{4}{100} \cdot x = 598 \]
First, combine the terms on the left-hand side:
\[ x + 0.04x = 598 \]
\[ 1.04x = 598 \]
Next, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 1.04:
\[ x = \frac{598}{1.04} \]
\[ x = 575 \]
Thus, last year's enrollment was 575 students.
