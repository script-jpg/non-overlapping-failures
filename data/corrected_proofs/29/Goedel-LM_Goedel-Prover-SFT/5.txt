Given that Liberty Middle School's enrollment increased to 598 students, which is an increase of 4% over last year's enrollment, we need to determine last year's enrollment. We are to show that it was 575 students.
Let \( x \) be last year's enrollment. According to the problem, the equation representing the increase in enrollment is:
\[ x + \frac{4}{100} \cdot x = 598 \]
Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:
\[ x \left(1 + \frac{4}{100}\right) = 598 \]
\[ x \left(\frac{100 + 4}{100}\right) = 598 \]
\[ x \left(\frac{104}{100}\right) = 598 \]
\[ x \cdot 1.04 = 598 \]
To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.04:
\[ x = \frac{598}{1.04} \]
Calculating the right-hand side:
\[ x = 575 \]
Thus, last year's enrollment was 575 students.
