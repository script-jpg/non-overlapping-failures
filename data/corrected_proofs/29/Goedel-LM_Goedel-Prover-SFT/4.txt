Given that Liberty Middle School's enrollment increased to 598 students, which is an increase of 4% over last year's enrollment, we need to determine last year's enrollment. We start by setting up the equation based on the given percentage increase. Let \( x \) be last year's enrollment. The equation representing the increase is:
\[ x + \frac{4}{100} \cdot x = 598 \]
First, we simplify the equation by combining like terms:
\[ x \left(1 + \frac{4}{100}\right) = 598 \]
\[ x \left(\frac{100 + 4}{100}\right) = 598 \]
\[ x \left(\frac{104}{100}\right) = 598 \]
Next, we solve for \( x \) by multiplying both sides by the reciprocal of \(\frac{104}{100}\):
\[ x = 598 \cdot \frac{100}{104} \]
\[ x = 598 \cdot \frac{25}{26} \]
\[ x = 575 \]
Thus, last year's enrollment was 575 students.
