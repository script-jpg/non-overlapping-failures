Given that Liberty Middle School's enrollment increased to 598 students, which is an increase of 4% over last year's enrollment, we need to determine last year's enrollment. We start with the equation representing the increase:
\[ x + \frac{4}{100} \cdot x = 598 \]
First, we simplify the equation by factoring out \( x \):
\[ x \left(1 + \frac{4}{100}\right) = 598 \]
Next, we convert the percentage to a decimal:
\[ 1 + \frac{4}{100} = 1.04 \]
Thus, the equation becomes:
\[ x \cdot 1.04 = 598 \]
To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 1.04:
\[ x = \frac{598}{1.04} \]
Performing the division, we get:
\[ x = 575 \]
