Given that Liberty Middle School's enrollment increased to 598 students, which represents an increase of 4% over last year's enrollment, we need to determine last year's enrollment. Let \( x \) be last year's enrollment. The equation representing the increase in enrollment is:
\[ x + \frac{4}{100} \cdot x = 598 \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ x \left( 1 + \frac{4}{100} \right) = 598 \]
Simplifying the factor inside the parentheses:
\[ x \left( \frac{100 + 4}{100} \right) = 598 \]
\[ x \left( \frac{104}{100} \right) = 598 \]
To solve for \( x \), we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of \( \frac{104}{100} \):
\[ x = 598 \cdot \frac{100}{104} \]
Calculating the right-hand side:
\[ x = 598 \cdot \frac{100}{104} = 598 \cdot 0.96 = 575 \]
Thus, last year's enrollment was 575 students.
