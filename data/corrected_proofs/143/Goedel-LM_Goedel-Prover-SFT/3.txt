To solve for \( a \) in the equation \(\dfrac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}} - a^{-1} = 1\), we start by simplifying the left-hand side of the equation. First, we simplify the fractions:
\[
\dfrac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}} = \dfrac{\frac{1}{8}}{\frac{1}{4}} = \dfrac{1}{8} \times \frac{4}{1} = \frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
Thus, the equation becomes:
\[
\dfrac{1}{2} - a^{-1} = 1
\]
Next, we isolate \( a^{-1} \):
\[
\dfrac{1}{2} - 1 = a^{-1} \implies -\frac{1}{2} = a^{-1} \implies a = -2
\]
Therefore, the solution to the equation is \( a = -2 \).
