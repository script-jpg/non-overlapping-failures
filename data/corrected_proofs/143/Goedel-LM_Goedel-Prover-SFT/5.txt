To solve for \( a \) in the equation \(\dfrac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}} - a^{-1} = 1\), we proceed as follows:
1. Simplify the expression \(\dfrac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}}\):
   \[
   \dfrac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}} = \dfrac{\frac{1}{8}}{\frac{1}{4}} = \frac{1}{8} \times \frac{4}{1} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]
2. Substitute this result back into the original equation:
   \[
   \dfrac{1}{2} - a^{-1} = 1
   \]
3. Isolate \( a^{-1} \):
   \[
   a^{-1} = \frac{1}{2} - 1 = -\frac{1}{2}
   \]
4. Solve for \( a \):
   \[
   a = -2
   \]
