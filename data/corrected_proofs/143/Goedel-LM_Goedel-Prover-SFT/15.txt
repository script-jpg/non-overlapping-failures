To solve for \( a \) in the equation \(\dfrac{8^{-1}}{4^{-1}} - a^{-1} = 1\), we start by simplifying the left-hand side. We know that \( 8^{-1} = \frac{1}{8} \) and \( 4^{-1} = \frac{1}{4} \). Thus, the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{8}}{\frac{1}{4}} - a^{-1} = 1
\]
Simplifying the fraction \(\frac{\frac{1}{8}}{\frac{1}{4}}\):
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{8}}{\frac{1}{4}} = \frac{1}{8} \cdot \frac{4}{1} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
So the equation is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} - a^{-1} = 1
\]
Subtracting \(\frac{1}{2}\) from both sides:
\[
-a^{-1} = 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
Multiplying both sides by \(-1\):
\[
a^{-1} = -\frac{1}{2}
\]
Taking the reciprocal of both sides:
\[
a = -2
\]
Thus, the value of \( a \) is \( -2 \).
