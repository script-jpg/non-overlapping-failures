Given the function \( f(x) = |x - p| + |x - 15| + |x - p - 15| \) where \( 0 < p < 15 \), we need to determine the minimum value taken by \( f(x) \) for \( x \) in the interval \( p \leq x \leq 15 \). We will show that the minimum value is 15.
To prove this, we consider the behavior of the absolute value functions. For \( x \) in the interval \( p \leq x \leq 15 \), the terms \( |x - p| \) and \( |x - 15| \) are non-negative and their values are between 0 and 15. The term \( |x - p - 15| \) is also non-negative and its value is at least 15.
By analyzing the intervals where each absolute value term is minimized, we can see that the minimum value of \( f(x) \) occurs when \( x \) is at the boundaries of the interval, specifically at \( x = 15 \). At this point, all terms are at their minimum values, and the sum of these values is 15.
