To determine the minimum value taken by \( f(x) = |x - p| + |x - 15| + |x - p - 15| \) for \( x \) in the interval \( p \leq x \leq 15 \), we need to analyze the behavior of the absolute value functions. The key insight is that the minimum value of \( f(x) \) occurs when \( x \) is between \( p \) and 15.
1. For \( x \) in the interval \( p \leq x \leq 15 \), the terms \( |x - p| \) and \( |x - 15| \) are non-negative and their sum is at least 15.
2. The term \( |x - p - 15| \) is non-negative and its value is at least 15 when \( x = 15 \).
Thus, the minimum value of \( f(x) \) is achieved when \( x = 15 \), and the value of \( f(15) \) is 15.
