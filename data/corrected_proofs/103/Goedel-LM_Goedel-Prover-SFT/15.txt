To solve the problem of finding \(9^{-1} \pmod{100}\), we need to find a number \(x\) such that \(x \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\). Given that \(x < 100\) and \(x \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\), we can use the properties of modular arithmetic to show that \(x = 89\).

-- We start by noting that 9 is less than 100.
have : 9 < 100 := by decide
-- We use interval_cases to check each possible value of x from 0 to 99.
interval_cases x <;> simp_all [Nat.mul_mod, Nat.mod_eq_of_lt]
-- The simp_all tactic simplifies the expressions using the given hypotheses.
-- Specifically, it checks that only x = 89 satisfies the condition x * 9 % 100 = 1.
