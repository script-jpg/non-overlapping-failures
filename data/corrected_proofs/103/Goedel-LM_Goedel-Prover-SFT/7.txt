To find \(9^{-1} \pmod{100}\), we need to find an integer \(x\) such that \(x \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\). Given that \(x < 100\) and \(x \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\), we can solve for \(x\) by testing values within the range. We start by testing \(x = 89\) and verify that \(89 \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100}\).

-- We need to solve the congruence equation x * 9 ≡ 1 (mod 100) for x < 100.
have : x = 89 := by
  -- Use interval_cases to test possible values of x in the range 0 to 99.
  interval_cases x <;> simp_all
  -- The simp_all tactic will simplify the expressions and check that x = 89 satisfies the congruence.
-- Finally, we conclude that x must be 89.
