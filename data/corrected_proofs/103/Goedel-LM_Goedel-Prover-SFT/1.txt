To solve for \( 9^{-1} \pmod{100} \) and show that the answer is 89, we start with the congruence \( x \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100} \). We need to find \( x \) such that \( x < 100 \) and \( x \cdot 9 \equiv 1 \pmod{100} \). Given the congruence, we can directly verify that \( x = 89 \) satisfies this condition.

  -- We use the fact that 89 is the modular inverse of 9 modulo 100.
  have h₁ : x * 9 % 100 = 1 := h₁
  -- Use the `omega` tactic to solve the congruence equation.
